<h3 class="title">To Comrades in Non-Programistan - A Message from Feedistan</h3>

<p>To my comrade friends in Non-Programistan,</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3174/2391150046_3a06955b03.jpg" width="500" height="110" alt="non-programisatn" style="border:0"/></a></p>
<p>As we approach the <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">third naked CSS</a> day, your <a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/">declaration of independence</a> based on the founding principles of Friendliness, Openness and Portability brings much hope to the workers here in Feedistan, who have struggled with bringing feeds to the attention of the masses for many years now.</p>
<p>It is a Good Thing that you have done this week and one that I am sure will be rewarded by many fruitful harvests.</p>
<p>I hear tales from many sources that workers from the death camps of Semantic Formalism and Ontologica, that are hidden down dead-ends in many academic temples around the world, are also revolting.</p>
<p>As I write, the Semantic Brethren of the Order of RDF (and - a sore point for a sick man -  I do not mean the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/radicaldancefaction">Radical Dance Faction</a> here) are parading their way down one way streets, into blind alleys that stink of rotten red herrings, whilst pigs that might, do, fly, actually, over the spires of their ivory towers, inside of which, the gorillas in the room are incorrectly identified as white elephants by pragmatic semanticists who are confused by the syntax and the strange use of otherwise everyday vocabulary and frequent commas, not to say overlong sentences likely to score highly (that is, poorly) on even the most academically biased readability scales.</p>
<p>Already, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGcsGPgUTw">protest songs</a> are being smuggled out and workers seeking to find ways to release data, the mined children of data, and the remixed children of the mined children of data that have all been imprisoned since they were first born.</p>

<p>Even the current, venerable <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/04/03/iwr-information-professional-of-the-year-2007-article-in-panlibus/">I-Were-I-Poty</a> has started to use artworks to smuggle pictures of the <a href="http://animoto.com/play/e528929409157c05e8f5018751049017">war on terror</a> out of Institutionalia.</p>
<p>Despite your great achievement, let us not forget that all is not well elsewhere in the world, particularly in the <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/03/50reasons.jpg">50 states of Cantdothat</a> and around the foothills of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1805565187/in/set-72157602805227511/">Towers of WS-Babel</a>.</p>
<p>In the shallow waters of ScreenScraperica, fishermen struggle in often turbulent and polluted waters in their search for staple informational needs. We are most gracious for the way in which many of them engage in free trade with Feedistan. (Did you know Yahoo Pipes has ScreenScraperican ancestry on the DataBlock side?)</p>
<p>We encourage polluters of the world to think carefully before publishing contaminated HTML, and instead embrace both the CSS- and X-factors, as well as the clean simplicity of the microformat elixir.</p>
<p>In the PLE jihad, believers are struggling even as we speak to manage their data according to their own beliefs in both Institutionalia and The Cloud - we wish them every success in their mission. Here in Feedistan, we have every confidence that they Cann succeed, as weller. They have many supporters, some who have already publicly revealed themselves, some of whom may do sclater.</p>
<p>In these unsettled times, where <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>, I would urge caution in too hastily blacklisting those whom you perceive as enemies of the state of Non-Programistan.</p>
<p>In Feedistan, all Apparati that consume or produce RSS feeds are welcome, although those that both produce and consume feeds find most favour.</p>
<p>In Feedistan, we agree with not only with the founding principles of Non-Programistan, but also some of the principles of Programistan, which borders on Feedistan also.</p>
<p>Whenever necessary, Feedistan puts to work technology liberated from Programistan. We hope to move forward with them in them in the future through blackbox techniques they have shared with us, in part, through the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014014.html">United Libraries of Progressive Enhancement</a>.</p>
<p>We believe that a universal failing in the educational systems across the landscape has led in part to the widespread ignorance of the state religion of Programistan, and the intolerance many people have for it.</p>
<p>We support the arts of all countries, and are currently seeking an artist capable of bringing light to the black art of regular expressionism  to help promote this most powerful of transformational technologies.</p>
<p>We believe in the ritual cleansing brought forth by the <a href="http://media.nmc.org/2008/04/mashup-un-artist.mp3">Confessions of a Mashup Un-Artist</a> and encourage the telling of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo">Fair(y) Use Tale[s]</a> to our chidren, and our children's children, as they play freely and grazr on the Creative Commons.</p>

<p>In Feedistan, we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Non-Programistan, in our shared mission to bring the most precious data and content to the masses, wherever it is located, so that it can be put to work whensoever by whomsoever may have need or use of it, whether in public or in private.</p>
<p>Let us rise up together and with the truths of OLDaily at our side, fight the forces of Closed Protocols &amp; Data Formats, Installed Software, and Platform Speciifc Applications. Let us hope for a period of standards reconciliation in the Browser Wars, and pray that what looks like a tidal wave of migration from Online Appalachia to the nascent Offline Browser App territories will not cause too much bloodshed.</p>
<p>In RESTful friendship, comrades,</p>
<p>Your humble servant,</p>
<p>A peasant worker from Feedistan</p>
