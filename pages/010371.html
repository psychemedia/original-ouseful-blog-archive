A key part of this role will be to help promote and raise awareness of the University's research activities. You will also advise researchers of national initiatives in scholarly communication and work with colleagues to help them understand how to promote alternative publishing models to researchers.</li>

You will be responsible for overseeing the application and quality assurance of metadata and providing training and guidance for colleagues. You will also assist the Metadata Manager in ensuring the smooth running of the Cataloguing and Metadata service.</li>
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3060&ref=ouseful"><em>Network Controller, Academic and Administrative Computing Services</em></a>: Computing Services is the central IT department for the OU, and it services the University's computing systems and IT infrastructure.

<p>There are a couple of more senior posts, too, that look interesting:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3085&ref=ouseful"><em>Chief Executive, University Centre Milton Keynes</em></a>: The colour of the building materials is significant but the finest academic institutions are defined by the talent, experience and leadership of people like you. In this newly created role you'll influence the development and direction of a brand new academic enterprise. Milton Keynes is a progressive, thriving centre ready to embrace economic growth, and at the heart of its expansion will be the new University Centre Milton Keynes. Embracing the needs of local businesses and communities, the Centre will be a focal point for 21st century higher education. It will combine state of the art technology, research, knowledge transfer and creative learning methods to inspire potential students and encourage new commercial activity. And you'll provide the strategic vision, curriculum development, financial management and inspirational leadership that enable its success.</li>
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3089&ref=ouseful"><em>Professor of International Higher Education Policy, Centre for Higher Education Research and Information (CHERI)</em></a>: Applications are invited for the position of Professor of International Higher Education Policy. The post-holder will play a leading role in the further development of the Centre as a leading international research centre in the field of higher education policy.</li></ul>
