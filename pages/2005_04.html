<h3 class="title">A Prior Art to Screencasts? E-Software Guides</h3>

<p>Before blogging <a title="Tony Hirst: SSOL - Screencast Supported Open Learning?" href="./002692.html">SSOL - Screencast Supported Open Learning?</a>, I emailed a cut down version of the post to a few colleagues. The resulting replies led to  a couple of follow up thoughts and prompted a few memories of related things past...</p>

<p>In particular, it seems that Juanita Foster-Jones is part of a team in the OU library who is <em>"currently involved in a project which has been looking at screen capture software as a medium for delivering information skills training"</em>. [Quoting from a personal email in a blog is not something I'm too comfortable with at the moment..however, by doing so, the public consequences of such an action may force me to think about the ethics of such an act more deeply...]</p>

<p>Juanita mentioned looking at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/captivate/">Macromedia Captivate</a>, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/products/studio/default.asp">Camtasia</a> and <a href="http://www.qarbon.com/products/viewletbuilder/">Viewlet Builder</a> for producing screencast equivalents. (Just for completeness, I'll mention the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows Media Encoder</a> too.) Free demo downloads of these products are available from the links provided, and can also be found quite frequently on cover mounted CD-ROMs/DVDs on the monthly computer magazines.</p>

<p>It also seems that I missed a talk on this very topic at this year's <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/workspace.cfm?wpid=4191">Tracking Technology for Academic Advantage (TTAA)</a> day. (For those of you with OU-SAMS access, <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/index.cfm?wpid=4191">here's the programme</a>.)</p>

<p>The presentation in question was given by Steve Armstrong on the topic of <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/document.cfm?docid=6195">Using animation for students’ software guides - moving away from paper in practice</a>. This describes the use of Viewlets to provide an eSoftware guide for a project management tool described in <a href=""http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/M865">M865</a>.</p>

<p>When I saw the abstract, I recalled having heard about E-Software guides when they were trialled a few years ago for this course, as it happens: <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/research/calrg/events/2001slides/marionedwards.ppt">The Why, What and How of E-Software Guides</a>.</p>

<p>Quite a few of the courses I work on require students to use software, and for some time i've been thinking about potential alternatives along the lines of a screencast. This blog is in part keeping track of my thinking on how best to do this given: a) how we've done it in previous OU courses; b) how the community is evolving related techniques currently.</p>

<p>The screencast (which to me is animated screen capture + <em>informal</em> narration) fits the qay I'd like to engage with students well, so it will be interesting to see how the 'old' (now!) M865 E-Software Guide and the new lLibrary Information Literacy courses differ in style.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the low producation values and informal narration of a screencast are acceptable for purchased course material, but I do think they are effective in 2 areas:</p>

<p>1) If the user has some mental model or prior understanding of how the software/web application works <em> in general</em> and you want to show them how an advanced feature works. (An example of this would be an animated <em>hint of the day</em>. I get really irritated by popups showing these when starting particular software applications becuase I don't necessarily get the point/power of the feature I'm being told about, but if I had a 1 minute screencast <em>demonstrating</em> how powerful a particular feature was, I think I'd be more tempted to pay heed.</p>

<p>2) Currently, we typically give students a list of instructions about how to perform some on-screen task, say, but <em>the student doesn't necessarily know where the instruction is going</em>. The screencast is a quick, efficient and visual way of saying "here's what you're gonna do". It sets the scene beautifully I think, although it probably wouldn't work so well for me  without the <em>informal</em> narration...(the transcript for hard-of-hearing students would look very poor though!)</p>

<p>Juanita also raised a few intersting points, which I shall (uncomfortably) log (<em>sic</em> here):</p>

<p><em>"There are some issues however. Most of these produce outputs as flash files, and flash is not very accessible. Captivate does have some accessibility features in that it allows you to add keyboard shortcuts for some of the operations, and you can also add text which screen readers can read, but you do need to consider this when using it. ... However you may find that you have to provide an alternative for those that need it.</em></p>

<p><em>"You also need to be aware of file size. I think depending on what you have in your session, it can vary the size of the file, and this might be an issue for students and ALs who do not have broadband (figures quoted at one of the TTAA day presentation mentioned that only 42% of ALS had broadband in 2004).</em></p>

<p><em>"I think as well there are issues over consistency of style, and indeed over the time entailed to create these products. I produced a 10 minute example, which I added as many of the interactive features as I could as an example of what the product could do. This took quite a bit of time. I think as well for more detailed items you may want/need to invest time in storyboarding before you go ahead, and then there is the time getting to grips with the product...</em><br />

<h3 class="title">Open Content OU</h3>

<p>There have been a couple of notable moves by the OU to take content open, one of  them announced in a flurry of press releases about the BBC et al. , one of them not.</p>

<p>The widely announced move relates to the <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk./">Creative Archive</a> (here's the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/events/8/2005413_40198_nr.doc">OU press release</a> if you're interested...(friendly format is it <em>not</em>?)).</p>

<p>The Creative Archive looks interesting, promising to open up content from the BBC, OU and Channel 4 archives to name but a few. It is largely based on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing model, although for some unmanageable reason presumably relating to either copyright, or license fee issues, (or both?!), it tries to limit scope to the UK.</p>

<p>As and when the OU starts opening it's content, I'll try and keep track of it here...</p>

<p>The other move was driven by an individual, Oxford Regional Office Staff Tutor Ray Corrigan. Ray authored a Technology Short Course Programme (<a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge</a>) course on <em> Law, the Internet and Society</em> and when that course ceased to be presented, Ray made moves to take it open. And with some success - because the  <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/t182/scripts/login.php">open child of T182</a> is now available under a Creative Commons license.</p>

<p>I'm a little upset it doesn't reveal itself to the <a href="http://www.common-info.org.uk/thoughts/archives/2005/04/see_which_creat.html">mozcc Firefox extension</a>, which pops an icon in your status bar to say the content is open under the Creative Commons, but that may yet happen... (I have to admit that I haven't as yet looked to see how the extension works, so don't know <em>why</em> it's not spotting what once was T182...)</p>

<p>I hope to blog at some point in the near future some of the <em>issues</em> involved with taking T182 open (perhaps Ray would like to contribute some comments?), and perhaps also top up on some of my thinking about the virtues of open licenses, revisiting the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/reports/7.pdf">Open Source Teaching Project (OSTP) report</a> from a few years ago.</p>

<h3 class="title">Web Based Activities</h3>

<p>Not so long ago, I noticed a simple but effective way of setting up web-based activities on the Science course, <a href="http//oseful.open.ac.uk/S381">S381</a> (although the same model may well be used on other OU courses too...), of which more below.</p>

<p>At the time, I mailed a note about it to a couple of people and FC conferences, and then promptly forgot about it... I am only reminded about it now because I was tidying out my mailbox and stumbled across it again.</p>

<p>In terms of knowledge management, this is not ideal... So I wonder whether blogging and tagging these sorts of posts represents a more effective way of capturing, and potentially sharing, this knowledge? One useful model would be to write a blog post, and then also have the option of mailing it to whoever I'd have sent it to if it was an email. This is likely to change for each post of course, so a simple notification to a (list of) the same email adress(es) is not really appropriate.</p>

<p>Category tags could perhaps be overloaded to perform this function, where the category tag defines a mailing list to send the post to as an email, as well as a serving a classification function.</p>

<p>But that is all a digression (albeit a recoverable one captured by the <em>blogmail</em> tag I'll assign as a keyword to this post).</p>

<p>So back to S381... the web activities are launched from a straightforward <a href="http://students.open.ac.uk/desktop/s381-05/custom4#">list of links to activities</a> (you'll need OU-SAMS authetication to see the page).</p>

<p>Clicking on an activity link opens up two windows. For example, an activity on <em>A review of binary evolution</em> opens the <a href="./s381exercise.html" onclick="window.open('./s381exercise.html','popup','width=545,height=544,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">activity description</a> as well as a window containing the <a href="http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abstract_service.html" target="_blank">target website of the exercise</a>.</p>

<p>As a model of interaction/instruction, it's very simple: a ttile, list of instructions, possibly a model answer (revealed by clicking a button in the exercise description pop-up window) and a target URL. Automatic URL monitoring can suppress the exercise and flag it for editorial/CT attention if the target site goes down, or even just if it changes.</p>

<p>The model is also readily describable in a structured way (for example, an XML DTD or schema).</p>

<p>Add a Wiki to this model of interaction and it may even be possible to grow a course from student input based on exercises that are rapidly generated (but not necessarily answered!) by course teams...</p>

<h3 class="title">SSOL - Screencast Supported Open Learning?</h3>

<p>I just stumbled across an interesting piece on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html"> on the merits of screencasting</a>, written by uber blogger <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a>. Jon is one of screencasting's major proponents and the person who <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/15.html">asked the community</a> what <em>movies about software</em> should be called before adopting the neologism screencast after a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/15.html">community vote</a>.</p>

<p>If you're new to the idea of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">screencasts</a>, they're movies about how to drive a piece of software or use a website, narrated in real time by a "tutor" demonstrating a particular task. Screencasts tend to be quite informal, and the narrator occasionally notices - or realises - something new to them whlst producing the screencast.</p>

<p>As this <a href="http://www.extremepodcasting.com/screencasts/technorati.html<br />
">screencast on Technorati tags</a> shows, production values aren't necessarily that high, but the combination of narrated explanation and on-screen demonstration is potentially very powerful.</p>

<p>How do you go about creating a screencast? Once again, Udell comes to the rescue with a piece about <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html">making screencasts</a>. The two most popular ways at the moment appear to be to use Camtasia (a commercial screen capture package that oftne appears as a freebie on computer magazine cover-mounted CD-ROMs); or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows Media Encoder</a>, which I saw mentioned in this post about a <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/discuss/msgReader$3427">Wikipedia screencast</a> (which is well worth watching if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> is new to you...).</p>

<p>So - is this likely to be useful for the OU? I personally think there may be something in the use of screencasts  because they add to the learning mix for courses that need students to do taks on-screen. The informality of the screencast is possibly an issue in an age where we have replaced students with customers, but the OU pioneered the idea of a tutorial in print as a <em>friendly</em> instructional medium and I believe screencasts can be seen in the same spirit - as a represetnative of the course team sat by the side of the student and working though the material with them. </p>

<p>There are <em>issues</em>, of course...</p>

<p>- people's memory of what happened in the screencast is limited, so paper support may be necessary as backup. That said, I think that the paper instructions can be simplified if there is an animated visual aid;</p>

<p>- production quality is likely to be low if screencasts are made by an academic... but we do write quite informally at times when producing 'tutorials in print' and i think this may help personalise the CT-student relationship. Screencasts could perhaps be providd through online course conferences as an informal <em>additional</em> CT provided resource if the quality is not deemed to be of an acceptable standard for delibvery as fully qualified course material;</p>

<p>- during course production, screencasts may help the editor/QA check that print instructions actually mirror the on-screen actions we want the student to perform.</p>

<p>I hope to produce a few demo screencasts in the near future. It will be interesting to see whether or not they become an animated, on-screen adjunct to the tutorial-in-print.</p>

<h3 class="title">Local to yOU</h3>

<p>The OU is quite unique in many ways, not least the geographical spread of our students. I've been having a play with the (new) UK version of <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">Google Maps</a>, trying to tie it in with autodiscovery of <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/geolocate.html">postcode information embedded in a page &lt;link /&gt; tag</a>, or personal postcode information retrieved from a cookie, for example.</p>

<p>So - what sort of geo-related information might we reasonably want to offer an OU student? Here are a few things off the top of my head (note that <em>local</em> is taken to mean local to a postcode associated with the student OR local to the study centre, say (so the family has something interesting to do while the student is at the tutorial)):</p>

<p>- local academic library with which the OU has reciprocal rights;<br />
- local study centre;<br />
- museums, pubs or eateries local to the study (easy enough to do now... here are <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=museums+mk7+6aa">museums local to Walton Hall</a>, for example);<br />
- local regional centre.</p>

<p>The local study centre is an interesting one, as it offers the OU the possibility of an affiliation with one of the online providers of route planning information, such as <a href="http://www.theaa.com/travelwatch/planner_main.jsp">the AA</a>, <a href="http://rp.rac.co.uk/routeplanner">RAC</a>, <a href="http://www.greenflag.co.uk/routeplanning/index.aspx">Green Flag</a>, <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/gbr/tpl/hme/MaHomePage.htm">Michelin</a>, or even <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google Maps</a>. So a student presented with directions could be provided with a link to a route planner showing the route from their home (say) to their local study centre. (For example, <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/gbr/dyn/controller/ItiWGPerformPage?reinit=1&strStartCP=MK7%206AA&strStartCityCountry=EUR&strDestCityCountry=EUR&image.x=17&image.y=3&strDestCP=OX1%205HR">here's a route from Walton Hall to the Oxford regional office</a>).  Just which route planner is used could be the result of an affiliation between the OU and one of the routemap providers, with the payoff being tied to the number of click-throughs, for example.</p>

<p>For the local academic library, it would also be easy enough to provide a personalised <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">library lookup bookmarklet</a>, such as this <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;void(win=window.open('http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?SAB1='+isbn+'&BOOL1=all%20of%20these&FLD1=ISBN%20(ISBN)&DB=local&CNT=25','LibraryLookup','scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=575,height=500'))};">OU Library lookup bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>It would also be sensible to be able to provide local information pulled from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/events.aspx">OU local event directory</a>. Perhaps if I ask them nicely they'll provide RESTful access to this service and an RSS response? :-)</p>
