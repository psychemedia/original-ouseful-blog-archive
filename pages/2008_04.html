<p>Another slow week on the Digital Worlds front, and again I didn't find the time for the half-a-day or so of tinkering that the the Game Maker posts require:-( And next week is already looking less than promising in terms of time available for daily posting, with two days being lost to the OU Making Connections conference...</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the weekly round-up, a week in which I started looking at how games can encroach on daily life in ways you may not necessarily expect...<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/20/post-hoc-game-documentation-walkthroughs-and-speedruns/">Post hoc Game Documentation - Walkthroughs and Speedruns</a>:  this post actually got a comment about a potential family learning dimension to Digital Worlds, which is somethiong I probably need to think a bit more about...</li><br />

<li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/args-uncovered/">ARGs Uncovered</a></li></ul>From the blog stats/link referrers, I also picked up on some interesting links via delicious from <a href="http://del.icio.us/truna">delicious user truna</a>, (who I'm guessing may be <a href="http://www.leagueofworlds.com/when-worlds-collide">a.k.a. j. turner</a>), particularly relating to the Hero's Journey and the role of story in game development. I was actually posting about that topic several weeks ago, so it's a real issue as to how an uncourse can best accommodate 'new' material.</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/truna" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2203/2446118902_fa7d042b1c.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="Dogotoal worlds delicious referral" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>(In our traditional course production process, where materials are developed over periods of months, and even years, there is always the chance of rewriting sections before they are produced. Of course, in those traditional production methods, the discovery of new materials through people linking to your own draft materials is not a possibility if the draft materials are sitting on a personal PC somewhere, hidden away from public, or at least peer, use...)</p>

<p>Anyway, as to how to accommodate the new material - I could have produced a new post, but instead I chose to add "additional reading" comments to the original Digital Worlds posts that mentioned the corresponding topics (<a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/mapping-plotlinesand-coping-with-interactivity/">Mapping plotlines…and coping with interactivity…</a> and <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/story-arcs-and-the-three-act-structure/">Story Arcs, and the Three Act Structure</a>).  I did consider amending/rewriting the original posts, but chose not to for no particular reason I've yet thought through...</p>

<p>I guess one way of maintaining a 'more on this subject' feed would be either to havea  special blog category or topic for posts that extend posts from much earlier in the uncourse blog, or maybe I could use and 'uncourse tutor' persona with which to post extension comments, and then produce a filtered feed of just these comments, maybe even mixing  in these comments to the main uncourse blog feed?</p>

<p>Anyway, taking the route I did - of adding comments to original posts using the same persona I've used for other chatty comments, etc., it gives me something to think about with respect  to non-linear authoring and how to author branching topic lines out-of-linear time sequence so that there is a well-defined trail through the topic for several particular audience types:<br />
<ol><li>people who have been following the uncourse blog for some time (and would have read the original annotated post at the time it was created, and therefore had an opportunity to subscribe to its comment feed if it was a topic they were particularly interested in, for example;</li><br />
<li>people who may have started following it recently (that is, since the original post);</li><br />
<li>people who happen across the post via a search engine, or link from elsewhere.</li></ol>Ho hum, always, always, each week raises more questions than it provides answers...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social%20discovery" rel="tag">social discovery</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Picking up on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014347.html">Embedding Single OpenLearn Unit Pages in an Arbitrary Blog Post</a>, it seems some people are never satisfied, (?!;-) so here's a bookmarklet (I think) that will take you from a page within and OpenLearn unit, to a Grazr widget containing a single feed item corresponding to that page.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:(function(){var d=document;var db=d.body;var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearnpagefeed.js';db.appendChild(s);})()">OpenLearn 'embed this page' bookmarklet</a></p>

<p>What this means is that you can emebed the content from a single OpenLearn unit page in any other page, via an OpenLearn branded Grazr widget. The widget can also be embedded on start pages, web desktops and so on...</p>

<p>The bookmarklet should have been trivial to produce. I had hoped to find meta data embedded within each OpenLearn unit content page containing, for example:</p>

<p><em>&lt;meta name="unitcode" content="T175_1"&gt;</em> - a nice, easy way to find the course code;<br />
<em>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1345/formats/T180_5_rss.xml" /&gt;</em> - I'verecently been thinking this format is useful because it provides a bridge from a unitcode (T180_5) to a crappy Moodle resource ID (1345).</p>

<p>Sigh....</p>

<p>Anyway, I managed to  find the unit code for the unit a page comes from by scraping the page (the most reliable place I found was in the tag attribute of the Facebook bookmark URL at the bottom of each page!)</p>

<p>To use the bookmarklet, drag it onto your browser toolbar (Firefox/Flock, dunno in IE); if you want to grab an embeddable version of an page from *within* an OpenLearn unit, just click the bookmarklet and it should hopefully take you to a Grazr widget that displays that page's content (in fact, it's the corresponding item in the unit's RSS feed).</p>

<p>To embed the widget in your own page, from the Grazr menu select <em>File-&gt;Add to Your Page</em> or <em>Share-&gt;Cusotmize</em>.</p>

<p>The bookmarkelt yet won't do much if you're on the 'main page' for a unit. When I get a chance, I'll try to make script context sensitive so that for whatever OpenLearn page you click  the bookmarklet on, the Grazr widget will contain something appropriate...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bookmarklet" rel="tag">bookmarklet</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20single%20page%20embedding" rel="tag"> single page embedding</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">TweetSpeech - Twitter to Speech Pipe</h3>

<!--
<p>I don't know what prompted it, but yesterday I started looking for a registration free RSS2speech service that I could use to produce and audio version of a Twitter feed. I did find <a href="http://say.expressivo.com/dQVkF60M">Expressivo</a>, which sort of lets you create audio messages for text strings up to a couple of characters long:</p>

<p><a href="http://say.expressivo.com/dQVkF60M" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2439965071_1fe43bd0c1.jpg" alt="expressivo" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="134" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>If you want to see the result, scroll down to the end fo the post - the bit in the middle is the techie "how to do it "detail... ;-)</p>

<p>What I had been hoping for was a 10 minute hack to get an audio file enclosure added to a twitter stream, by using something like:<br />
<em>http://mp3generator.expressivo.com?say=say%20this%20out%20loud</em><br />
to get an MP3 file I could use to augment the twitter stream...</p>

<p>But it didn't look that simple... so I <a href="http://twitter.com/psychemedia/statuses/796260681">tweeted</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dfflanders/statuses/796261728">David Flanders replied</a>, and I thought 'what the heck...'</p>

<p>So here was the problem - go to an Expressivo page with a particular message, <a href="http://say.expressivo.com/dQVkF60M">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>The audio plays from the page. At the bottom of the page is a link to the audio file:</p>

<p><a href="http://say.expressivo.com/dQVkF60M" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2214/2440804094_c337bac0da.jpg" alt="expressivo share" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="249" width="410" /></a></p>

<p>The download URL is not nice though... <a href="http://say.expressivo.com:8080/media/37/72/3772bb468373baab54bc2a17adc2c33dd.mp3"><em>http://say.expressivo.com:8080/media/37/72/3772bb468373baab54bc2a17adc2c33dd.mp3</em></a></p>

<p>Which isn't so much of a problem - I can pull the page into a Yahoo pipe and just scrape it to pull the URL out, right...? (Yahoo pipes can be used as rudimentary screen scrapers.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2440807356/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3264/2440807356_46e3fa924c.jpg" alt="expressivo js" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="44" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Wrong - the link is generated by a Javascipt/AJAX function...</p>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<p>Well, if I can recreate the AJAX call, I can then parse the URL out of what's returned from the MP3 file url generating service...  One quick way of finding out what AJAX call the page is making is to watch the header traffic flowing through my browser:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2439991723/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3196/2439991723_10ff341488.jpg" alt="expressivo header" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="366" width="363" /></a></p>

<p>So I can recreate a call to the Expressivo MP3 generatr, and hopefully get a response back containing ther URL of the MP3 file.</p>

<p>Here's a pipe to test that bit out - <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=LGwAnE0S3RG1rNPn6UjTQA">Expressivo MP3 Test pipe</a></p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=LGwAnE0S3RG1rNPn6UjTQA" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3136/2440814754_846a631f27.jpg" alt="expressivo MP3 pipe" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="347" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>What this pipe does is produce a single item RSS feed that contains an enclosure corresponding to an MP3/spoken version of the message that is passed in to the pipe.</p>

<p>So now, all I have to do to get a Twitter2speech service running is to embed this pipe in another pipe that pulls in a Twitter feed, pass it each tweet, and attach the appropriate MP3 file attachment as an enclosure to the Twitter stream - <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tweetspeech">TweetSpeech pipe</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tweetspeech" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2440000831_166e4c441a.jpg" alt="tweetspeech pipe" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="358" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So to recap - the output of the TweetSpeech pipe is a twitter friends stream for a particular Twitter user, with each item augmented with an MP3 file as an enclosure that speaks the tweet aloud...<br />
  <br />
The result is most easily viewed/listened to in a Grazr widget:</p>

<div style="height: 350px; width: 300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=vrgoRE4S3RGiW_RVmLokhQ&amp;_render=rss&amp;id=dfflanders"><img alt="Grazr" src="http://static.grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" style="border: medium none ;" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://static.grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=vrgoRE4S3RGiW_RVmLokhQ&amp;_render=rss&amp;id=dfflanders"></script></div>

<p>Just click on any item and you should get an embedded player that will play the tweet aloud... (at least, until Expressivo maybe decide they don't like this hack!;-)</p>

<p>PS I have received reassurances from Grazr that the widget will continue to be supported, as a free service: "NOTHING will change with the widget or any existing feature. Whatever is there will remain there. Whatever is free now will remain free always."<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/grazr" rel="tag">grazr</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20tweetspeech" rel="tag"> tweetspeech</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20expressivo" rel="tag"> expressivo</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter2speech" rel="tag">twitter2speech</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I'm really pushed for time at the moment, so it's looking like the <a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com/">Visual Gadgets uncourse blog</a> is going to have to be produced with as little effort, and as in little time, as possible...! ;-)</p>

<p>The approach I want to explore is combing posts built almost entirely around content forma single page of an OpenLearn unit, with posts of my own built around dynamically included data and on the fly chart generation using the Google visualisation API.</p>

<p>So for example, today's post (<a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com/2008/04/presenting-data-in-tables.html">Presenting Data in Tables</a>), which is the first 'proper' contentful post, took maybe 10 minutes, plus 10 minutes tool building.... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2438405783/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2222/2438405783_91693ffed9.jpg" alt="single openlearn item in grazr" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="411" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This post is built around a Grazr widget that contains the content from a single page page on a particular OpenLearn unit. (Each unit page on the OpenLearn site is represented by a single feed item within the full content RSS feed for the corresponding unit.)</p>

<p>(You many notice that the Grazr widget is displaying the content of the first item fed into the widget in an uncollapsed/expanded way... (or you may not!;-) This is achieved by passing the argument <em>&exp=1</em> into the widget, which tells it to expand the identified feed item. More here: <a href="http://feedonomics.grazr.com/index.php/archives/category/widget-arguments/">Grazr widget arguments</a>.)</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, I had been exploring how I could use a transclusion hack (based on <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/purple-include-transclusions-you-know-you-want-them">Purple Include</a>) to mine the item from an OpenLearn unit XML feed, but this approach is far less techie;-)</p>

<p>Here's the tool I built, anyway:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/openlearnunitfeed%20" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/2439245846_564be06a41.jpg" alt="openlearn unit feed item filter" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="360" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the pipe here: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/openlearnunitfeed%20">"OpenLearn unit feed item title filter" pipe</a></p>

<p>It works by taking in an OpenLearn Unit code, and fetching the content RSS feed for that unit. A filter then acts on the feed, only allowing items through whose description contains a query term, which corresponds to the title (or part of the title) of the single OpenLearn page you want to appear in the feed.</p>

<p>I also created a simple form to allow for the easy creation of the Grazr widget URLs based on an OpenLearn Unit code and a title filter term: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openlearnItem.php">OpenLearn Unit filtered item(s) widget form</a>.</p>

<p>I did ponder the idea of setting up a pipeline that would take the filtered feed and generate a PDF document that could then be displayed in iPaper, but that was getting to be a few too many steps in the pipleline, and I'm not sure what the benefit would have been (though it did get me wondering whether Scribd have any intention of supporting an "RSS feed import" as one of their upload document types!)</p>

<p>Anyway, here's hoping there are enough appropriate single OpenLearn pages on graphs, charts and data representation and visualisation to allow nme to crack on with <a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com">Visual Gadgets</a> in such a painless way!;-)</p>

<p>PS Of course, I'm also hoping that with Grazr reinventing itself as a feedmerging business (<a href="http://feedonomics.grazr.com/index.php/archives/406">What Does Grazr Do?</a>), the widget will continue to be made available...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualgadgets" rel="tag">visualgadgets</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/grazr" rel="tag">grazr</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Offline Working with Scribd</h3>

<!--
<p>Since Scribd released their embeddable document previewing iPaper (when I also put together a couple of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013390.html">Scribd bookmarklets</a>) I've largely given up on using Acrobat to view PDF documents on the web and Zoho previewer to view word and powerpoint linked docs.</p>

<p>Yesterday night, whilst sitting waiting for a boat home, and with offline access only, I thought I'd do a quick tab sweep - and joy of joy realised I'd embedded a couple of blog linked PDFs via a Scribd 'iPaper this (embed)' bookmarklet before I left the OU:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2438828930/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2438828930_ff67a007b4.jpg" alt="2008-04-24_1426" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="350" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Which meant I could read the docs without having downloaded them to my desktop... (Just like I'm trying not to print out so many docs any more, I'm also trying not to download edocs to my desktop; if they're 'one read only' docs, I try to keep them in the confines of the browser!)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ipaper" rel="tag">ipaper</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pdf" rel="tag">pdf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20offline" rel="tag"> offline</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">OU Suggestion Box</h3>

<!--
<p>The story so far... the first time I saw our current VC at a 'meet the troops' session several years ago, someone suggested during the Q&A session at the end that a 'suggestion box' scheme might not be a bad idea for helping support (attempts at) innovation within the OU... several years on, and, err....</p>

<p>Anyway, over on Stuart's Social Communications blog today, I was overjoyed to see his post about about  <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=177">OU IdeaScale</a>, a vote 'em up, vote 'em down suggestion box courtesy of Ideascale.</p>

<p>For those of you not keeping up at the back there, I think it was Dell who a year or so ago started the current round of 'listen to the customer' suggestion boxes with their bespoke <a href="http://ideastorm.com/">IdeaStorm</a> website.</p>

<p><a href="http://ideastorm.com/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2242/2435407304_3cf1b4c4de.jpg" width="500" height="377" alt="dell ideastorm"  style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>More recently, Starbucks released what may well be a mashup suggestion box site on the Salesforce platform: <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/home/home.jsp">My Starbucks Idea</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/home/home.jsp" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2435405036_afc7cf0f2d.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="my starbucks idea"  style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>Ideascale moves the game on by offering a hosted, generic solution to setting up your own online suggestion box. Whilst the interface, user registration and moderation tools still need a bit of work, it looks like it could be quite fun... ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://ou.ideascale.com/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2435400626_09e67128f3.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="Ideascale" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>To see the OUtrageous* suggestion box, visit <a href="http://ou.ideascale.com/">http://ou.ideascale.com/</a>.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure how long it'll remain there, though - the service is in beta only for a short time, and may then introduce a payment plan (which really should be for the white label, skin-it-yourself version, IMHO) - but who knows... maybe it'll be around long enough to catch a good idea or two...?! ;-) And even then, if a payment plan <em>is</em> enforced for the service...? Well, who knows? If the site is generating traffic, interest and ideas, what price do we put on a good idea?)</p>

<p>One thing I'd be interested to see appearing on the site would be future course suggestions, just to get a feeling for how crowd intelligence might be used to inform our curriculum planning activities, if nothing else?</p>

<p>I've posted before about how <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">search powered prediction markets</a> might also be used to help us identify possibly attractive courses, so maybe it's time to think about that possibility again too.... (prediction markets themselves keep hitting the news at the moment because <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html">Google has been using them</a>)hmmm (thinks), Stuart mentioned that our Site Intelligence web analytics tool has archived data going back some time...hmmm, again... do I maybe feel a model coming on?! That said, most of the prediction market apps I had bookmarked appear to have deadpooled... what does that say about them, I wonder? ;-) This one still seems to be around though: <a href="http://inklingmarkets.com/">Inkling Markets</a> and this project may still be active: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zocalo/">Zocalo</a>)</p>

<p><small>*OUtrageOUs = unofficial, public facing, OU related webservice that's such a good idea that it can't not be done - so it has been... act first, get permission later... if permission is refused, someone will probably set up an equivalent "fake OU" service anyway...</small></p>

<!--
<p>It's that time of year when the OU internal conference takes place (next week in fact) and this year the theme is "Making Connections" (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/making-connections/index.shtm">conference website</a>).</p>

<p>Trying to work out which parallel session to go to is a bit of a pain though... so given tag clouds are back in vogue, I wondered whether I could use them to help me decide which sessions to go to... </p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples (created by running a cut and paste of all the abstracts in a session through <a href="http://tagcrowd.com">TagCrowd</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Session 1A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2431061478/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2431061478_eed4504375.jpg" alt="making connections 1a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="257" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>... and the theme of the session? <em>Quality eLearning: New models for course design</em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Day 1 - Session 3A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2431062896/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2431062896_513f515677.jpg" alt="making connections 3a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="183" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><br />
... and the theme of the session? <em>Quality eLearning:  Using evaluations in quality eLearning </em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Day 1 - Session 5A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2430252071/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2430252071_b4f64cb83e.jpg" alt="making connections 5a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="195" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>... and the theme of the session? <em>Working with employers: The space between academe and practice</em></p>

<p><br />
This sort of representation could make for an interesting splash projection screen to announce each session?</p>

<p>Also conference related, and picking up on Martin's desire to use twitter or social glue in the new IET building (<a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/04/crowdstatus-and.html">Crowdstatus and filtered twitter</a>), I wonder whether conference foyer screens showing recent tweets from conference delegates might also be an interesting idea?</p>

<p>(Btw - anyone noticed how blog posting frequency appears to have gone down since twitter started hitting the edublogosphere? Do the stats bear this out, I wonder? Note to self - in annual appraisal meeting, suggest that over the next year I should increase the amount of conversations I have with interesting people in bars and cafes, as measured by the number of rounds of drinks I have purchased on expenses (i.e. my beveragarati ranking ;-))</p>

<p>PS anyone know what the Making Connections conference tag is?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cloud%20tag" rel="tag">cloud tag</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20conference" rel="tag"> conference</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/20/killing-monsters-in-game-maker/">Killing Monsters in Game Maker</a></li></ul>After a week or two away from Game Maker, I've also started posting a few more tutorials, and search engine optimising the titles of those posts to a certain extent, too. (I've noticed a certain amount of Game Maker related search traffic coming to the site from the search engines, so having started to secure some of that traffic, I now need to find ways of converting the visitors so they hang around a bit, work through the game Maker tutorials, and maybe even start to look at the more 'academic' content...)</p>

<p>The Skillset post is really clunky, and comes over feeling very dry, but I think that trying to integrate this sort of "industry standard learning objective" content is the right thing to do - if only I can work out how!</p>

<p>I also added a plug for an OU course (and it's associated OpenLearn content) in the Skillset post - to the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01TA212">Technology of Music course (T1212)</a>, in fact - though I don't expect many people to click through from it...</p>

<p>What I'm starting to think is that it would be handy to have a "courses around this topic - ish" link maybe in a sidebar alongside each post? </p>

<p>Finally, form a production and maintenance point of view, it's worth noting that some typos have made it into posts on the Digital Worlds blog, but because it's so easy to go in and make an edit, if I do spot a typo whilst looking back at a post, it's no trouble to go in and correct it (unlike a trad-OU course where I'm not allowed to go anywhere near live material...)</p>

<p>The comments to each post allow me to loosely append content to any post at any time, and (although I have tried to avoid doing this) I can also go in and add an extra paragraph or two to a legacy post if necessary.</p>

<p>Monitoring incoming traffic is one reason that might inspire such changes to a post - for example, if certain search terms are driving a lot of traffic to a particular post, or if a post becomes popular for some reason, I can go in and make a tweak or two if necessary just to exploit that traffic, and maybe convert the visitor to an uncourse follower, OpenLearn user or OU enquirer...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalwords" rel="tag">digitalwords</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gamemaker" rel="tag">gamemaker</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20gamemaker" rel="tag"> gamemaker</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yoyogames" rel="tag">yoyogames</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>One of my favourite Google watching sites is <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>, a great site for keeping tabs on what's happening in the Googleverse. So tonight, whilst going for a ramble around the BBC website, I wondered whether there was an equivalent for the BBC?</p>

<p>For example, did you know:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.bbcactive.com/">BBC Active</a> ( formerly known as BBC Worldwide Learning, (includuing BBC Children's Learning and BBC Languages)) is now part of Pearson Education: "The partnership will be co-owned by Pearson Education and BBC Worldwide, with BBC Worldwide holding a minority stake, and will sit alongside Pearson's existing educational publishing businesses." <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/10_october/pearson_partnership.shtml">BBC Active signals new partnership for BBC Worldwide and Pearson Education</a>. (When I posted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012470.html">If Universities Were Companies</a>, and idly wondered whether Pearson might make a play for a struggling university, I had no idea they had been buying up chunks of the BBC since October 2005!)</li><br />
<li>the BBC Archive is up and running, albeit just on a single topic at the moment, as far as I can tell: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/titanic/">BBC - Archive - Titanic</a>;</li><br />
<li>whilst at the JISC conference, one of the BBC speakers quipped that the BBC wants to "own time"; as well as the lapsed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/default.stm">On This Day</a> minisite ("Video and audio from the BBC News archive WWII and 1950-2005. This site is archived and no longer updated."), the upcoming <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/memoryshare/">Memoryshare</a> would appear to be part of that play, a user submission site for capturing people's memories and popping them on a timeline. (I've covered some of the BBC's other timelime plays here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=bbc%20timeline">OUseful posts on BBC timelines...</a>);</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/">BBC Learning Zone</a> includes a growing <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/">clips library</a> featuring streamed clips from BBC schools programmes. At the moment, clips play in the BBC media player, rather than the iPlayer.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/04/bbc_iplayer_on_wii.html">iPlayer on the wii</a> - a bit slow when I tried it last week, maybe it's a bit quicker this week?</li></ul><br />
Anyway, until a "BBC blogscoped" site appears, here are a few feeds to keep tabs on:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/">BBC Radio Labs blog</a> - this is where I found out how to get <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/03/still_playing_in_the_cloud_1.shtml">'live text' over XMPP</a> (I had to get the geeky 'duh? wassat?' bit in somewhere!;-)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/">BBC Internet Blog</a>, "a place where senior staff from BBC Future Media teams will discuss issues about the technology behind bbc.co.uk, our mobile services and the BBC's presence on the internet."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC Backstage</a> - the BBC community developer area, and the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/">BBC Innovation Labs</a>...</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/nmfeeds/serve.pl/pressoffice.xml?cat=New%20Media">BBC Press Office - "New media" news announcements</a>.</li></ul><br />
PS here's a <a href="http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/BBC_Blogoscoped">BBC Blogoscoped OPML file</a>, and here's an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=hOQPBkHW2xGuVSF3jknRlg&_render=rss&opmlURL=http%3A%2F%2Fgrazr.com%2Fdata%2Fpsychemedia%2FBBC_Blogoscoped">aggregated BBC Blogsocoped RSS feed</a> generated by merging the contents of the separate blog feeds contained in the OPML feed.<br />

<!--
<p>Internet access has been somewhat fractured for me this week (and will continue to be...), so I scheduled several posts for the <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com">Digital Worlds</a> blog to try can keep the daily delivery thing running...</p>

<p>To write several posts that would get me a few days ahead, I needed to cut down on the production time for each post, so I tried a little experiment writing one post based around some OpenLearn material: <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/representing-analogue-sound-files-in-a-digital-way/" title="Representing Analogue Sound Files in a Digital Way">Representing Analogue Sound Files in a Digital Way</a>.</p>

<p>The post actually pulled in material from two sepearate OpenLearn courses: “Crossing the boundary - analogue universe, digital worlds” (in particular the section <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=187478">Crossing the boundary - Sound and music</a>) and “Representing and manipulating data in computers” (in particular the section <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=175793">Representing sound</a>).</p>

<p>I re-presented the material in a single block quote, and used a general copyright notice at the end to qualify its use: "Copyright OpenLearn/The Open University, licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Licence</a>".</p>

<p>Here are a few observations arising from the exercise:</p>

<p>1) "absolute linking" makes seemless embedding/reuse of material difficult. For example, diagrams were referred to by figure numbers:</p>

<p><a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=187478" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2131/2420034513_43ff99e2b8.jpg" alt="openlearn figure" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="294" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>One technique I used to address this issue was not to really refer to figures directly at all, instead using the flow of the document to take the reader from the text into the image:</p>

<p><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/representing-analogue-sound-files-in-a-digital-way/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2141/2420041635_3f320ba50a.jpg" alt="openlearn flow referencing images" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="419" width="482" /></a></p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the HTML of the OpenLean materials uses relative links to image assets rather than absolute links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2420049725/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2420049725_9ff85cd6bb.jpg" alt="2008-04-17_1031" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="46" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Rather than grab copies of the images to host them locally, I actually pointed the image source URLs at the URLs used in the OpenLearn units. Whilst this does mean that OpenLearn can track the use of the image through my materials, it also means that I am trusting OpenLearn not to change the image URLs - if they do change, my materials break.</p>

<p>2) References were made to previous sections using absolute references:</p>

<p><a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=187478" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2007/2420037039_8f3fc904f2.jpg" alt="openlearn linking out" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="67" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>To preserve this sort of absolute reference, one approach is to contectualise it within a reference to the original reference:</p>

<p><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/representing-analogue-sound-files-in-a-digital-way/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3145/2420860462_5d245c0e8a.jpg" alt="openlearn - literal reference" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="149" width="459" /></a></p>

<p>3) the material in the two units was stylistically different in the use of headers:</p>

<p><a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=187478" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/2420031505_5f5734c4a8.jpg" alt="openlearn saq" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="71" width="283" /></a> <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=175793" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2058/2420846912_76cc47d763.jpg" alt="openlearn saq" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="120" width="275" /></a></p>

<p>4) with reusing material from two units, how should the content be referenced? In the re-presentation I used, it is impossible to say which part of the blockquote came from which openlearn unit. I also needed to add filler material to join the extracts from the two OpenLearn units, and this is embedded within the blockquote.</p>

<p>The major problem with reusing the content in as light a touch way as possible was having to adopt the voice and teaching line of the original unit authors, as well as finding workarounds for 'incremental'/backreferenced teaching (e.g. "think back to the methods we used for...").</p>

<p>Finding relevant content was also an issue. Leaving aside the matter that I used my own <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3Augr-oyrmt-4">OpenLearn custom search engine</a> (and in particular the 'resources' search refinement) to discover resources on the OpenLearn site, rather than using the OpenLearn search engine itself, finding material that could be taken from OpenLearn and inserted into the Digital Worlds storyline without breaking that storyline too badly could have been easier.</p>

<p>For example, the OpenLearn site is architected at the unit level; finding related resources across units is not really supported within the site other than through free text search (though I think they are trying to experiment with tagging).</p>

<p>Reusing the content did save me some time though, and I'll be looking for opportunities to do it again. Having a good awareness of what material is in OpenLearn would make this easier - knowing when to look to OpenLearn for material with a high likelihood that something relevant will turn up, for example - so on my todo list is a content recommender that will do content analysis on blog posts as I write them, and then pull in OpenLearn recommendations related to those content analysis terms (c.f. serendipitwitterous).</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much OpenLearn content is relevant to Digital Worlds though? So as part of another uncourse blog experiment, this time for a chunk of a module I have to prepare for another course, I'm going to try to reuse as much OpenLearn content as possible.</p>

<p>The topic is visualising data, and the uncourse blog experiment site for it is here: <a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com/">Visual Gadgets</a> (starts next week, hopefully...;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20visualgadgets" rel="tag"> visualgadgets</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Over the weekend, I came across <a href="http://johnjohnston.name/tw/present.php">Twitter presenter</a>, a proof of concept way fo using a Twitter feed as the basis for a presentation inspired by a tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/ewanmcintosh/statuses/787083310">@ewanmcintosh</a>: "Can one present by Twit?"</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012788.html">feedshow link presenter</a> takes and RSS feed in, typically from a social bookmarks site, and uses it to provide a set of links to web pages that are to be talked around during a presentation.</p>

<p> I've been meaning to add an option to feedshow that lets you preface a displayed web page with a comment, provided either by the title or description element of the input feed, so as a step on the way to that, here's a quick proof of concept sideshoot from feedshow - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/t/">Twittershow</a> (or should that be <em>TweetShow</em>, or even <em>Tweeshow</em>?! (original typo...;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/t/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/2412550303_9253b78634.jpg" alt="icoshare - twittersplash" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="269" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>If you want to try twittershow out, here's the URL: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/t/">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/t/</a></p>

<p>If you want to look at just your own tweets, go to your own twitter page - e.g. http://twitter.com/ewanmcintosh - and use the RSS link from that page (e.g. <em>http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/625753.rss</em>).</p>

<p>If you'd rather look at the twitterings of random people based on a search using something like Tweetscan (which also provides an RSS output feed for every search), just use the appropriate feed URL. For example, here's a Tweetshow on <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/t/feedshowMaster.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftweetscan.com%2Frss.php%3Fs%3Dtwitter%2Bin%2Beducation&amp;title=Twitter+in+education&amp;author=From+a+search+on+Tweetscan">"Twitter in education" (from a search on Tweetscan)</a> that uses the feed <em>http://tweetscan.com/rss.php?s=twitter+in+education</em>.</p>

<p>There are obvious usability issues  - the show works with a fixed number of only the last so many tweets, there is no auto synching to the twitter feed -  but then, I only spent 20 minutes on putting the demo together... and 10 minutes putting this post together...</p>

<p>I also need to pull out any links contained in the tweet, and use them as pagelinks (as for example in a 'normal' feedshow).</p>

<p>Whilst mulling around that idea, it seemed that as an alternative to showing a comment and then the web page, I could maybe provide a caption area underneath the main presentation window, that displays the comment at the same time as the linked to web page?</p>

<p>Don't you just love RSS? ;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/feedshow" rel="tag">feedshow</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twittershow" rel="tag">twittershow</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Searching for Sites that Link to the Target of a TinyURL</h3>

<!--
<p>Last week - I think - I came across a RESTful way in to a set of JSON returning Google search web services, that let you call on individual Google search engines (the main web search engine, the booksearch engine, the blogsearch engine, and so on) and get nice clean data set results back (albeit, not necessarily many at a time). If you're impatient for the detail, check the service(s) out here: Google AJAX Search API (<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_intro_fonje">Flash and other Non-Javascript Environments</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_intro_fonje" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2411708876_1a9d390be5.jpg" alt="Google JSON search APIs" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="214" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>What this means of course is that now Google searches becomes trivially available within Yahoo Pipes (without the need for screenscraping). So for example, here's a way of seeing what pages Google thinks link to a particular web page using the <em>link:</em> search limit:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=8pHZqo0I3RGBZ3x06kjTQA" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3088/2410894547_f9eef0ea3e.jpg" alt="pipes google link search" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="296" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Given an input URL (via the pipe's homepage, or as an argument in the pipe's URL), the String Regex block rewrites the url- e.g. <em>http://www.open.ac.uk</em> - in the form <em>link:wwww.open.ac.uk</em>. <em>link:</em> is a Google advanced search query search limit that says 'find me the sites that link to the following URL".  (<a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html">Google Web Search Features - Who Links to You?</a>)</p>

<p>THe URL builder then constructs the URL of a query to the Google AJAX API. Depending on the actual service URL used in the URL builder, this might return results from the Google web search engine or the blogsearch engine, for example.</p>

<p>The Fetch Data block can receive XML or JSON feeds as input. In this case, we're receiving JSON from the Google AJAX (JSON) API.</p>

<p>If you've been reading OUseful.info over the last few days, you'll know I've been playing with various TinyURL related pipes (e.g. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014197.html">The delicious history of a TinyURL</a>).</p>

<p>So here's another one. A service that takes a TinyURL and then sees, via the Google web service, what web pages and what blog pages link to the page the TinyURL actual refers to... <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=caa47cb2b123ca36cb4f21256a4eb033">TinyURL inlinks pipe (blog and web).</p>

<p>Firstly, we decode the TinyURL using something I prepared earlier ;-)</p>

<p></a><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=caa47cb2b123ca36cb4f21256a4eb033" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2139/2410915143_b905fc7a9f.jpg" alt="tinyurl inlinks" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="136" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The spilt takes the URL in two directions. One strand is going to seed the blogsearch, the other the web search.</p>

<p>Here's the blog search path:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=caa47cb2b123ca36cb4f21256a4eb033" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2410949287_40d5edb8f6.jpg" alt="pipes blogsearch inlinks" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="404" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The loop block cycles through each item in the feed (in fact, there is only a single item, and that contains the URL pointed to by the TinyURL) and passes it to the URL inlinks (blog search) pipe. This nested pipe accepts a URL (passed from the title of the feed item that entered the Loop block) and uses it as an argument in a Google blog search AJAX API request. The result is used to replace the feed item that entered the block.</p>

<p>The format of the result is still in the form returned from the web service, so the Rename block makes sure that a valid RSS feed item response is produced. </p>

<p>The two strands then get merged and actually passed through a regular expression that tidies up some escaped characters:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=caa47cb2b123ca36cb4f21256a4eb033" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2348/2410938261_1829654c13.jpg" alt="tinyurl inlinks pipe regexp" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="215" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Easy :-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20REST" rel="tag"> REST</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Here's this week's round-up from the <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com">Digital Worlds</a> uncourse blog experiment. Other things got in the way somewhat, so the posting frequency was a few posts down on what I really need to producing, and it's looking as if the same will be true for the coming week. I'm also going to be offline for a few days in the coming, so I'm going to have to schedule some of the posts...<br />

I've started trying to make more use of third party readings, but these do tend to break the flow somewhat. If I was using my own Wordpress installation, I'd be tempted to launch readings into a lightbox that would overlay the actual blog poast, but the free hosted wordpress site doesn't allow user scripts or modules:-( (This also means I can't try out any progressive enhancement code, which is also a bit of a pain :-(</p>

<p>I have put together a Google Custom Search engine that searches over the Digital Worlds blog as well as all the sites I link to from the blog, but I'm still trying to get a feel for how useful this is. I haven't publicised this search engine yet (this is the first public mention of it) though it is publicly listed and is open to volunteers. At the moment there is only a single refinement - a limit that allows searching <em>only</em> over the Digital Worlds blog. I'm not sure what other refinements to offer as yet, if any more at all... For what it's worth, here's a link to the default page: <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3Abf8jg9spayc"><em>Digital Worlds</em> Custom Search Engine</a></p>

<p>The daily reader numbers are down, so either everyone who was passing by has wandered off because they've lost interest in the content, or they were only reading to see what sort of presentation model was being used... and now they know, there's little reason to keep going back...</p>

<p>Through a confluence of school holidays here (with all the attendant intrusions that that situation brings to the average homeworker!), and lesser apparent reader engagement (e.g. via user stats and user lower user comments) I've also felt less engaged with the content (maybe this is a self-reinforcing negative cycle? A couple of the posts from last week were scheduled in advance  - I had tried to get ahead with some scheduled postings knowing my work week was likely to be disrupted - BUT that broke the daily cycle/posting ritiual I had been developing; I also missed a post (scheduled or otherwise) on one of the days last week...</p>

<p>Game Maker posts fell by the wayside completely last week, though I did try to leave a launchpad post into self-directed 'study' on developing a Game maker platform game the week before, knowing this was a possibility (<a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/growing-the-platform-game-youre-on-your-own-now-if-you-want-to-be/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Growing the Platform Game - You’re On Your Own, Now (If You Want to&nbsp;Be!)&quot;">Growing the Platform Game - You’re On Your Own, Now (If You Want to&nbsp;Be!)</a>). If I get a free day in the coming week, I'll try and get a series of Game Maker posts out for the weekend... but it's looking unlikely :-(<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/difitalworlds" rel="tag">difitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google%20cse" rel="tag">google cse</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20custom%20search%20engine" rel="tag"> custom search engine</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">iTwitterous Rationale - and Reimagining as iCoShare</h3>

<!--
<p>[Provenance: the first part of this post arose out of a conversation with <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/">Alan</a> and <a href="http://edtechie.net/">Martin</a>.... and a warning by the way - this is a <em>long</em> post...]</p>

<p>Chatting with a couple of people about iTwitterous, my iPod Touch representation of serendipitwitterou, and it seems no-one gets it...</p>

<p>As Alan put it, "I had a particular problem with serendipitwitterous.  It always looked good and I'd start using it with great anticipation, then it would take me somewhere, I'd look around, say 'What did I come in here for?', and get frustrated with it. ... Twitter is about communication and not about content/resources, and I think that's where [serendipiTwitterous/iTwitterous] so far have hit the wall - they lead to static resources rather than conversations."</p>

<p>So... first point: iTwitterous and serendipiTwitterous are riffs on the idea of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=feed%20annotation%20stream"><em>feed annotation streams</em></a>. They use a crude content analysis technique (the Yahoo  term extraaction service) to identify terms that can be used as search terms or search keys etc. to find other resources... which as Alan points out is maybe not the point...</p>

<p>...but then, Google built a business on it...? ;-)</p>

<p>To reiterate the surface idea behind serendipitwitterous: a tweet is 140 characters or so on a theme; content analysis tries to identify the topic; a search on content analysis terms finds resources to annotate the orginal thread. That is, it tries to find things that might add to, enrich or supplement a conversation.</p>

<p>So I look at my twitter feed, or somone elese's twitter feed, and a list of possible related resources are presented to me, a bit like having an automatic Google jockey for my twitter conversations sat at my side...</p>

<p>Now here's part of the problem, and something Alan hinted at: is the twitter stream useful because of engagament with people chatting (i.e do we find a sense of community, and involvement in water cooler conversation, by following peoples' tweets), or are we in part using it to serendipitously try and discover things of interest to us by eavesdropping on thoughts spoken out loud, pretending people are talking <em>to us</em> and using that to justify why we might think what they've said aloud is relevant to us?</p>

<p>Here's where iTwitterous starts to have an idenityt of its own compared to serendipitwitterous. Rather than providing a view of a river of tweets from the people I follow on Twitter, explores different ways of presenting tweets and the germs of ideas contained withing them.</p>

<p>iTwitterous was the first step on what I'm now thinking of as <em>iCoShare</em> (more of which later...)</p>

<p>The basis of iTwitterous was this - <em>the twitterstream from people I follow serendipitously turns up stuff that may be of interest to me; what other ways can I find of surfacing interesting stuff serendipitously, using the twitter stream as a starting point?</em></p>

<p>And this is what the different iTwitterous menu options start to explore, and why it's not hahlo (it was never intended to be a Twittter client; I <em> don't want</em> to know your Twitter password, so you can't tweet from iTwitterous; iTwitterous is a <em>browsing</em> service, that's all...)</p>

<p>So for example,  there is the normal river of tweets view (the most recent tweets from people I follow, in reverse chrnologicial order).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404209382/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2359/2404209382_fa7152477f.jpg" alt="iwitterous following" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="250" width="409" /></a></p>

<p>You also get a view ordered by content analysis serendiTerms which may hint at things your're interested in (because it's a distillation of of tweets from the people you share interests with have twittered, right?) and from those terms a list of resources discovered through searching on those terms.</p>

<p>This view can actually grab your attention in way that looking at a list of complete tweets in the normal reverse chronological can't do, by misapprehending something (which is what lies behind a lot of serendipitous discoveries, I think?)</p>

<p>Like last night, browsing the iTerms view, I saw this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404250462/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2175/2404250462_ee4bed0106.jpg" alt="itwitterous - severance" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="178" width="405" /></a></p>

<p>Uh, oh... has the funding crisis finally hit?</p>

<p>Apparently not - here's what the search turned up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2403426543/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2206/2403426543_96b2bd6c09.jpg" alt="itwitterous severance film" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="342" width="421" /></a></p>

<p>(Note that the iTerm search view is now headed by the original tweet that sourced the iTerm. Clicking througn on the twitterer's name link takes you to an iTwitterous view of their twitterstream.)</p>

<p>Thank goodness for that - it's just Martin (who turns out to be a film buff) watching some film or other... Hmm, there's a trailer for it - which I duly watched (and wouldn't have just from reading his tweet). [The iPod Touch takes you to a 'full screen' landscape view of a video when you originally click through a Youtube link.]</p>

<p>Back to the iTwitterous main menu. The <em>Following</em> view  (originally called <em>Recent Friends</em>) shows you who's been twittering lately - so this is like looking over the unread blog posts by feed/blog in a feed reader right? You can look at the whole river of blog posts (tweets) view  or you can be more selective and read by blog (recent friends). It's <em>another</em> way of ordering, or segmenting, the view over the whole twitterstream:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404563507/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2089/2404563507_67d933b53e.jpg" alt="itwitterous following view" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="247" width="410" /></a></p>

<p>(It's worth noting here that the Following view is actually a view ofver people you follow who have twittered <em>recently</em> rather than a view over all the people you follow, some of whom may not have twittered for some time... So the listing is <em>current</em>.)</p>

<p>Originally, iTwitterous let you add one or more hashtags to the URL and it would then give you the chance to browse a list of tweets containing those hashtags, as discovered by the Twemes search engine.</p>

<p>I revised the code so that now it will also extract any hashtags contained in the current twitterstream, and let you browse over all tweets that contain these tags, again courtesy of Twemes.</p>

<p>That is, iTwitterous will now display a #tag menu option if any hashtags are found in the list of most recent tweets you've created or are following <em>as well as</em> any tags you've explicitly referred to in the URL :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404209382/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2359/2404209382_fa7152477f.jpg" alt="iwitterous following" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="250" width="409" /></a></p>

<p>So now, from the front page menu, I can go straight to the #tags menu option and see a summary view of what hashtags the people I follow have recently used (if there aren't any, the menu option does not appear), rather than scanning the full twitter feed.</p>

<p>So for example, last night, here's what the people I follow had recently hashtagged:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404194004/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3266/2404194004_568ea85ee6.jpg" alt="itwitterous discovered hashtags" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="141" width="420" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking through on a tag takes you to a list of recent tweets containg that tag from Twemes:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404197942/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2404197942_9121382e70.jpg" alt="itwitterous hashtag tweets" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="288" width="412" /></a></p>

<p>It's worth mentioning here that I took the decision at this point to <em>not</em> display as the first item the tweet(s) responsible for the hashtag being displayed in the #tags list. Instead, iTwitterous just displays the most recent tweets (courtesy of twemes) containing that hashtag.</p>

<p>If the tweme/hashtag is popular at the moment, then it's possible that the tweet that caused the tag to be listed by iTwitterous won't make it into this hashtag listing (for example, if it wasn't twittered recently enough). If I don't recognise who twittered the hashtag from the feed, or they don't appear anyway, then to see the actual tweet in which the hashtags originally appeared I need to look at the list of tweets, or maybe guess at the person responsible via the Following list.</p>

<p>(Hmm - I guess I could flag any hashtags used next to the people who used them, and similalry, flag the twitter ids of the people who used the hashtag in the hashtag menu?)</p>

<p>With the automated hashtag discovery view, iTwitterous really diverges from the notion that I'm looking at the tweets from people I follow, to one where I'm following an idea, as manifest by a particular hashtag and as suggested by someone I follow twittering about that subject.</p>

<p>What iTwitterous encourages you to do, then, is drop the idea of using it to look at a twitterfeed... Instead, you are using it to view a <em>serendipistream</em>...;-)</p>

<p>If you click on the link for a hashtag, it takes you to an iTwitterous page for that hashtag.</p>

<p>I still don't expect you to get it though, so I spent an hour or so this morning adding another menu option to the list - <em>delicious</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404605145/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3054/2404605145_6f1c85d0a2.jpg" alt="iCoShare - hastag finds delicious" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="297" width="411" /></a></p>

<p>What the delicious iCoShare routine does is take the top level username or hashtag and use it to guess at a delicious username, <em>or</em> act as a delicious tag (as appropriate), and then pull in either the most recent links tagged that way <em>or</em> the most recent links from the delicious user's network.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404621391/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/2404621391_8bc9279a7d.jpg" alt="iCoShare - delicious net" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="308" width="432" /></a></p>

<p>(Of course, the tag could also be used as flickr or Youtube tag, too.)</p>

<p>The <em>URL history</em> link points to the history page for that URL on delicious - that is, the list of people who have bookmarked that link and how they described it.</p>

<p>If you browse the delicious network links for a <em>user</em>, then the link results listing also includes the name of the person who bookmarked the link. Rather than pointing to their delicious account, iCoShare guesses that the delicious username is also a valid twitter username (hopefully relating to the same person!) and links it back through to the iCoShare page for that user.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2405454568/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2020/2405454568_a07069b624.jpg" alt="iCoShare - delinetwork" height="280" width="411" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>(Note that I took the decision <em>not</em> to list the user's own bookmarks... because this app is all about serendipitous <em>social</em> dicsovery, right?;-) Howver, I maybe need to add a link to other peoples (guessed at) delicious links?</p>

<p>What the heck - it's only 3 or 4 lines of code:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2405465696/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2405465696_09a6c3f0af.jpg" alt="icoshare - delicious links" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="282" width="409" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking the <em>/whoever/ on delicious</em> will take you to their delicious page...</p>

<p>So that's it, iTwitterous starts to morph into iCoShare...</p>

<p>And another change of URL, I'm afraid... <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ico.php"><em>iCoShare</em> http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ico.php</a></p>

<p>The next step is to work on the social life of URLs a bit more, and allow iCoShare to work with URLs as well as usernames and tags... I'm thinking this will be based around the use of the delicious history page... but I need to walk the dog to ponder that through...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/icoshare" rel="tag">icoshare</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/serendipitwitterous" rel="tag">serendipitwitterous</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/itwitterous" rel="tag">itwitterous</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/delicious" rel="tag">delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

(pivotwitter?!)</a>)</p>

<p>I also described a pipe that would find the actual url of a page from a TinyURL.</p>

<p>Looking for a quick five minute tinker just now, I thought I'd plug the two together to create a pipe that takes a tinyurl andin return gives a list of who's bookmarked it - and how - on delicious:</p>

<p>TinyURL to delicious history pipe: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tinyurl2delihistory">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tinyurl2delihistory</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2403485819/" title="tinyurl2delcioushistory by psychemedia, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/2403485819_0059a169e5.jpg" alt="tinyurl2delcioushistory" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="258" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>It even works...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2404320642/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/2404320642_4dd2f97b1c.jpg" alt="tinyurl2delihistory pipe output" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="127" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I guess the next step is to create a simple wrapper that handles a "normal" (literal?) URL <em>or</em> a TinyURL, and then calls the appropriate pipe...</p>

<!--
<p>Just walking the dog after a dog of a meeting, and I think I glimpsed how another couple of jigsaw pieces fit together...</p>

<p>Sometimes people twitter a link; and their tweet is a bit like comment around that URL...</p>

<p>So, how about a <em>pivotal service</em> (cf. pivot searching - geddit? ;-) that extracts a list of links from a twitter feed (for example) and for each link provides a list of <em>commentaries</em> on that link, and maybe a list of other people who have rated that link, as evidenced by how that link has been bookmarked on delicious...</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/url/125097ca345e365126fc00264bde59d3" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2400689653_a3a2dab4f6.jpg" alt="ou on delicious" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="436" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(We do track people bookmarking the OU I guess, and in particular people bookmarking particular courses on the Courses and Quals site, and try to find ways of exploiting that info I assume? Thought not... ;-) I guess for anyone new to all this delicious'n'twitter stuff, delicious is one of the best known online social bookmarking sites, and twitter is evil. Here's how it works: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x66lV7GOcNU">Common Craft: Social Bookmarking in Plain English</a>; and, err, just be careful: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o">Common Craft: Twitter in Plain English</a>.)</p>

<p>So here's some background: <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/urlhistory">delicious url history pages</a>. As to how to do the pivot thing (that is, looking up a link on delicious that appeared in a twitter feed...), here's part of it...</p>

<p>First of all, <em>look</em> at the URL of an example page (e.g. <em>http://del.icio.us/url/125097ca345e365126fc00264bde59d3</em>, note that the RSS feed to that page is <em>http://del.icio.us/rss/url/125097ca345e365126fc00264bde59d3</em>, realise that the list of numbers is a particular encoding of the URL (an MD5 hash), find a Yahoo pipe that takes a URL and gives the MD5 hash of it (e.g. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=bDnIFMol3BG2NNQXlfXiAA">MD5 hash pipe</a>), steal the important bit (a call to <em>http://www.hashserver.com/</em> that returns an MD5 hash of your URL):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hashserver.com/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2051/2401490522_96f3d99ae1.jpg" alt="MD5 hash pipe" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="121" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Take that MD5 hash of the URL, build a delicious history feed URL from it, and grab the feed:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/deliurl" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2037/2400666849_f81e1d7196.jpg" alt="delicious hashtag pipe" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="486" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the pipe: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/deliurl%20">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/deliurl</a></p>

<p>It has the added useful side effect of giving you a good guess at the title of the page too... I suppose you could build a list of 'suggested' titles, and pick the one that is used the most as the title of the page linked to? (It seems somehow wasteful calling a whole page just to read the contents of its &lt;title&gt; element?)</p>

<p>It should be easy enough to build an iPod Touch page, e.g. reusing iTwitterous like stuff, that will then give a list of other people's 'comments' from delicious on each URL that appears in a twitter feed, based on whether they have filled a description in for the bookmark; pretty much for free, you also have a list of some of the people who have bookmarked it, and a list of the tags they have used...</p>

<p>(From the delicious user names, I guess you could have a guess at some friendfeed usernames, and if you strike lucky, maybe confirm the person on delicious is the person you guessed at on friendfeed; from this, you may be able get their twitter ID too... (or you could just guess it...).)</p>

<p>Confused? You should be - but it's all easy enough to do.... building the iPod Touch page is left as an exercise for the reader... heh heh ;-)</p>

<p>PS ok, I know, lots of twitter urls are TinyURLs... but the TinyURL preview page provides a way round that maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2400751439/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2400751439_05acbbc484.jpg" alt="tinyurl preview" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="342" width="499" /></a></p>

<p>Here's a possible Pipe: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tinyurlpreview">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tinyurlpreview</a></p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/tinyurlpreview" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2400744133_fa758178fe.jpg" alt="tinyurl to full url" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="339" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Or something like that anyway...</p>

<p>[UPDATE: I made up a mashup of the two pipes to create a new one that takes a TinyURL and looks up the delicious history of the full URL the TinyURL points to: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014197.html">The delicious history of a TinyURL</a>]</p>

<p>PPS I guess a service to auto bookmark any URLs you twitter, using the tweet as a bookmark description, could be sensible; which is exactly what something like this appears to do: <a href="http://alexgirard.com/twitt/">http://alexgirard.com/twitt/</a> (hmm, the page won't load for me any more after to trying to download the code? Anyway, what it appeared to do was watch your twitter feed and send any links you twittered to delicious:-(<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pivotwitter" rel="tag">pivotwitter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yahoo%20pipes" rel="tag">yahoo pipes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20tiinyurl" rel="tag"> tiinyurl</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>There are a couple of tweaks in this dev update...</p>

<p>Firstly, support for hashtag links, e.g. you shouild be able to click a hashtag link and get to an iTwitterous page for it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2400203555/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2140/2400203555_e0148f2def.jpg" alt="itwitterous hashtag1" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="32" width="474" /></a></p>

<p>Click on the hastag and go to something like <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?hashtag=nws08">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?hashtag=nws08</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?hashtag=nws08" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/2400206715_358836e694.jpg" alt="itwitterous hashtag2" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="276" width="406" /></a></p>

<p>Here's an example of Tweets for 'user' <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?hashtag=uolplag">#uolplag:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?hashtag=uolplag" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2408/2401202830_64209d4778.jpg" alt="itwitterous - hashtag 'user'" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="298" width="412" /></a></p>

<p><br />
An individual can also opt in to watching one or more tags as well as their own twitterstream, for example <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?id=ajcann&amp;tags=uolplag,todo">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php?id=ajcann&amp;tags=uolplag,todo</a> (for more than one tag, use comma separation, no spaces):</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/69zubm" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2400383797_5fca0491ea.jpg" alt="itwitterous user and tags" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="297" width="413" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on the #tags link takes you to a listing of the tags specified in the URL. (I was thinking of also listing any tags that appeared in any tweets in the feedhere...)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2401217862/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2401217862_80c45ca727.jpg" alt="itwitterous user tags" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="142" width="415" /></a></p>

<p>At the moment, these tag links give a feed like the #uolplag one above - the results of a global twitter search on the tag. However, the original intention was also to provide a view that just showed a user's tweets tagged in a particular way... (as well as a view, from a top level menu item, over the results from a <a href="http://tweetscan.com">Tweestcan</a> search for <em>@username</em>).</p>

<p>That said, I get the feeling that no-one can see past the fact they they use hahlo, (even though "myTwitterous" (a bookmarked, personal iTwitterous instance) is only a click from the iPod Touch home screen (just like many hahlo bits are a click or two away from any other hahlo page)). So rather than waste any more time on it, iTwitterous is hereby consigned to the OUseful random/null bin. I set a script going that rolls a one in a million die whenever anyone loads the app - if the one in a million comes up, the app is deleted... so it'll probably be around for a bit - but maybe not...;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/itwitterous" rel="tag">itwitterous</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yet-another-pointless-waste-of-time" rel="tag">yet-another-pointless-waste-of-time</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Just a quick post to note that <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ist.php">iTwitterous</a> (serendipiTwitterous for iPod Touch) has had an update...</p>

<p>I added a "loading spinner" that is displayed whilst the page waits for the Pipe to deliver the serendipitwitterous feed, and another menu option - <em>Recent Friends</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2400658132/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2400658132_df6e205e74.jpg" alt="itwitterous - recent friends" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="308" width="400" /></a></p>

<p>which displays a list of the people ("followed", or "following", rather than "friends"?) who have recently twittered, along with a count of the number of their recent twwets (i.e. those tweets that appear in your friends/following feed):<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2400660512/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2069/2400660512_c67f13ebde.jpg" alt="itwitterous - recent frinds" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="264" width="402" /></a></p>

<p>The tweet list also displays a link to view that user's feed in iTwitterous:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2400664178/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2400664178_1a01118278.jpg" alt="itwitterous friend recent tweets" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="315" width="400" /></a></p>

<p>So next up is hashtag/tweme handling, I guess?

<h3 class="title">Not Quite Seeing How it all Fits Together...</h3>

Yesterday, I had a little tinker with a minimal OpenSocial widget for a Ning site that simply displayed a list of a users friends on Ning: (See the widget code here: http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningOpenSocial1.xml) I then tried to use the same app...
<!--
<p>Yesterday, I had a little tinker with a minimal OpenSocial widget for a Ning site that simply displayed a list of a users friends on Ning:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2398747235/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2123/2398747235_74207dfd0a.jpg" alt="opensocial" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="154" width="277" /></a></p>

<p>(See the widget code here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningOpenSocial1.xml">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningOpenSocial1.xml</a>)</p>

<p>I then tried to use the same app code to view my friends on Facebook using the <a href="http://www.opensocket.org/blog/">OpenSocket</a>  Facebook app that essentially implements an OpenSocial container within Facebook (see the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/opensocket/faq/contents.php">OpenSocket app on Facebook</a>).... but it didn't work...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://opensocket.org/gadgets/profilecollage.xml">OpenSocket demo/example code</a> worked fine in Facebook, and almost in Ning:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2398767047/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2398767047_9a76e3e518_o.png" alt="opensocial collage" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="189" width="188" /></a></p>

<p>If I ever have a free few minutes again, I'll tweak the image calls and see if I can get images to display in Facebook and on Ning using the same code!</p>

<p>I should maybe read the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial documentation</a> too....! As well as this <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/">Myspace Apps/OpenSocial Documentation</a>. Maybe the <a href="http://developer.bebo.com/">Bebo Developer docs</a>?</p>

<p>Anyway, as well as having to get a minimal, working OpenSocial friends widget together, here's what I don't undertsand...</p>

<p>OpenSocial is one jigsaw piece, Lego block, whatever..</p>

<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Google Social Graph API</a> may be another...</p>

<p>friendfeed is a third...</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2231/2398817913_408314afc2.jpg" alt="friendfeed" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="331" width="442" /></a></p>

<p>or rather, these bits: </p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia?output=opml" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/2399653482_137b228710.jpg" alt="friendfeed opml" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="196" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Or even more comprehensively, a foaf record of subscriptions on other services, and a user's followers within friendfeed:</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia/subscriptions?output=foaf" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2403/2398828419_89f472b5e4.jpg" alt="friendfeed" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="224" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The friendfeed foaf file sets up all sorts of possible running round the web treasure hunts, of course...</p>

<p>For example, I can recurse my friends foaf feeds, and their friends foaf feeds etc; or if I have twitter authentication, I can go in to twitter via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation">twitter API</a>, pull off the twitter ID of <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/friends.xml">100 or so of my twitter friends</a>,  and then maybe guess that their twitter IDs are the same as their friendfeed IDs (though this isn't necessarily the case) - if they are, I can pull off their identities on other services via their friendfeed foaf file; or, I can just try to guess their identity on last.fm, delicious, etc assuming it's the same as their twitter id.</p>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>This grabbing of the social graph is all so easily achievable (and I guess the Google social graph API is already doing a chunk of it), but ... so what? I can almost but not quite feel what this could be really good for... certainly there are a lot of friend recommender services surfacing at the mo (e.g. I came across <a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/twitslikeme/">Twits Like Me</a> today), but that's not it... I figure the only way to grok it, is to try to build my way there (though it might go nowhere <em>and I have no idea where it would lead...</em>) But I have no time to play at the mo - far too much other crap to do, and I'm flagging before midnight each day now....arrrghhhh.....</p>

<p>PS this post is even more random than usual because I have just completely run out of time on....well, everything.... real projects and side projects alike! Back to Digital Worlds posts tomorrow - only another 8-10 weeks of it to go... ho hum...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social" rel="tag">social</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/api" rel="tag">api</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20confused" rel="tag"> confused</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20tip%20of%20my%20tongue" rel="tag"> tip of my tongue</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/story-arcs-and-the-three-act-structure/">Story Arcs, and the Three Act Structure </a></li></ul>
I also set up a wiki on wetpaint - <a href="http://digitalworlds.wetpaint.com/">http://digitalworlds.wetpaint.com/</a> - to explore how I might be able to refer readers out to exercises on it (although none of the handful of uncourse readers appear to have tried creating a page yet...) In particular, creating template pages feels right, somehow, though the proof of course would actually be in a proper course setting where students somehow felt compelled to engage in the wiki?

<p>I've also had a couple of days writing two or three posts ain one go, and then scheduling their publication time (e.g. I have one cued up for tomorrow already) to try and find a way of getting myself a light day - or even a day off! Authoring this way certainly puts into perspective the commitment we require of OUr students, even on a 10 point course.</p>

<p>Something that's started to intrigue me is the extent to which narrative structures, and the structures that underpin games with a strong narrative, might also apply to learning design. Whren I manage to free up some creative mental energy, I'll have a think about how to use e.g. emergent story techniques as another way of (re)presenting the uncourse blog itself.</p>

<p>Tools-wise, it's possibly also worth mentioning that I used graphviz to generate the graph view of different story structures in <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/an-unfortunate-sequence-of-events/">An Unfortunate Sequence of Events...</a>. It was certainly quicker than drawing them by hand, and made playing around with them to tweak the structures really easy.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/graphviz" rel="tag">graphviz</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20wiki" rel="tag"> wiki</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

[UPDATE: the current version of iTwitterous can be found at http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php; for more info about the updates, see iTwitterous - Experimenting with hashtags and Twemes and iTwitterous update] Last week, I got hold of an iPod Touch (thanks Martin), but...
<!--
<p>[UPDATE: the current version of iTwitterous can be found at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php</a>;<br />
for more info about the updates, see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014177.html">iTwitterous - Experimenting with hashtags and Twemes</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014161.html">iTwitterous update</a>]</p>

<p>Last week, I got hold of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a> (thanks <a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a>), but I didn't really have a play with it - and then only a quick one - till the weekend.</p>

<p>First thing to do was work out how to add a home screen icon for the BBC iPlayer and podcast web pages (<em>Add to Home Screen</em> from the bookmarks menu), how to <em>delete</em> a home screen icon (just press it until it jiggles...) and then, after seeing a few tweets about it, a home screen icon to the <a href="http://hahlo.com">hahlo</a> Twitter client.</p>

<p>Realising quite quickly that a lot of embedded media doesn't work as embedded media, I also added the <a href="http://joemaller.com/2008/01/12/itransmogrify/">iTransmogrify</a> bookmarklet (<a href="http://joemaller.com/___?javascript:if%28typeof%28iTransmogrify%29%3D%3D%27undefined%27%29%7Bvar%20s%3Ddocument.createElement%28%27script%27%29%3Bs.src%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fjoemaller.com%2FiTransmogrify-latest.js%3Fq%3D%27%2B%28new%20Date%29.getTime%28%29%3Bdocument.getElementsByTagName%28%27head%27%29%5B0%5D.appendChild%28s%29%7Dvoid%280%29">iTransmogrify</a> installation guide) which replaces embedded media with links to the media items, that the iPod Touch can then handle appropriately.</p>

<p>And then I had a look at doing a quick web page specifically for the touch. I opted for the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a> style library, which can generate menu like pages built up in a way reminiscent of wml card decks (I'll maybe do a quick transformation of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007342.html">demo WAP/WML course pages</a> I produced 6 years ago (?!) as iUI pages...).</p>

<p>Being a lazy sort, I thought I'd reuse one of my other tinkered apps and just port it to iUI. Along the way, I made a few changes to the information architecture of the app, to make it easier to extend in the future.</p>

<p>So here it is, the first attempt at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/serendipitwitterous">serendipiTwitterous</a> (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013746.html">about serendipitwitterous</a>), for the iPod Touch. The screenshots come from <a href="http://iphonetester.com/">iphoneTester</a>, but they work equally well in a browser (and best in <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> - which is now available for Windows, as I'm sure you've all heard... In fact, you may find it's appeared on your Windows desktop already, as if by magic...)</p>

<p>Just because, I've called the app <s><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ist.php">iTwitterous - <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ist.php</em></a></s> The current URL is <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php</a>.</p>

<p>(To use your own id as the starting page, the url should be something like: <s><em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ist.php?id=<strong>yourTwitterID</strong></em></s> [that is, <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/<strong>ajc</strong>.php?id=<strong>yourTwitterID</strong></em>] )</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php" title="iTwitterous"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2394881549_de59149bf0.jpg" alt="itwitterous home page" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="500" width="325" /></a></p>

<p>The first menu option (<em>Tweets</em>) is just a view over you and your friends Twitter feed:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php" title="iTwitterous"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3127/2394883683_e1b3a9fe22.jpg" alt="itwitterous tweets page" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="500" width="341" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on a link takes you to the page. Clicking on a Twitter username takes you to the iTwitterous page for that user:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php" title="iTwitterous"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2352/2394886045_f912b5bd4c.jpg" alt="itwitterous other user" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="188" width="419" /></a></p>

<p>The <em>serendipiTerms</em> menu option takes you to a list of terms extracted from the current user's personal and friends twitter stream using the Yahoo pipes term extraction routine.</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php" title="iTwitterous"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2173/2395724740_f3e54ccb9a.jpg" alt="itwitterous serendipiterms" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="425" width="397" /></a></p>

<p>Each of these <em>serendipTerms</em> then links to search results based on those terms.</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/i/ajc.php" title="iTwitterous"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2394893931_b80676b50a.jpg" alt="itwitterous serendipiterm search" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="353" width="402" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking through a link takes you through to the web page.</p>

<p>Thinking back to Martin's post on <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/04/tweetclouds.html">Tweetclouds</a>, I guess I could use those as alternative serendipTerms (<em>cloudTerms</em>, I guess) and then rank them according to weight?</p>

<p>Hmm, looking at <a href="http://www.tweetclouds.com/user_pages/psychemedia.html">my own Tweetcloud</a>, it looks a bit simplistic - just listing all the words in the stream after filtering some common ones out... I'm sure there's something in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21">Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications</a> that could do a far better job... ;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/itwitterous" rel="tag">itwitterous</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/serendipitwitterous" rel="tag">serendipitwitterous</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Just over a year ago now, I mentioned in a post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010108.html">The Future of Music</a> that Nine Inch Nails appeared to have got into the habit of releasing versions of their songs as free Garageband 'source' files. Just recently, <a href="http://www.radioheadremix.com/information/">Radiohead</a> have started selling Garageband source files of their latest single (and REM have released free <a href="http://supernaturalsuperserious.com/">src movie files</a> for a video remix competition).</p>

<p>Checking back on the NIN site, with newly designed <a href="http://remix.nin.com">NIN remix area</a>, I notice this bit of blurb about <a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/remix/">Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D, the Year Zero remix album</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/remix/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2391914279_4191e70a7c.jpg" alt="NIN remix album" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="119" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(I love it when a prediction comes together... ;-)</p>

<p>Now, I don't know how long it took it took Brian Lamb to: a) find, and b) put together his <a href="http://media.nmc.org/2008/04/mashup-un-artist.mp3">Confessions of Mashup Unartist</a> masterpiece [<a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/045788.php">background info from the DJ himself</a>),  a veritable soundscape of a radio play, rather than a typical audio lecture, but it got me wondering whether or not he was going to release the src too?!</p>

<p>It also made me wonder - if I had any clue about a/v remix - how I would go about finding the resources, putting the mix together, and actually performing it? (I'm not saying I could do this - I'm saying, where would I think to start...)</p>

<p>I guess I'd look for audio by searching for words or phrases to sample using something like or <a href="http://www.podscope.com/">Podscope</a>, <a href=""></a> even <a href="http://audio.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's audio search</a>,  </p>

<p>The thing is, podcasts are maybe not authoritative enough? This could be though - <a href="http://www.spokenword.ac.uk/">Spoken Word Services</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Our core aim is to enhance and transform educational experience through the integration of digitised spoken word audio and video into learning and teaching.<br />
...<br />
We are attempting to make a substantial portion of the BBC’s radio archive accessible online for educational use ...</blockquote><br />
Here's more:</p>

<div style="width: 425px; text-align: left;" id="__ss_27608"><object style="margin: 0px;" height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc-3586"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc-3586" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="355" width="425"></object><div style="font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="SlideShare" /></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BigRedBall/connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc?src=embed" title="View 'Connecting Pasts and Futures: Spoken Word Services and the BBC' on SlideShare">View</a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload?src=embed">Upload your own</a></div></div>

<p>The British Library also make "12,000 selected recordings of music, spoken word, and human and natural environments" available through their <a href="http://sounds.bl.uk/">Archival Sounds Recordings Service</a>, although if you actually try to listen to the content or do anything with it out of the gaze of the Copyright Police, they'll have to shoot you... ("This is an audio resource for UK higher and further education. Anyone can search or browse the information on this site. For copyright reasons, only people in licensed UK higher and further education institutions, or in our reading rooms, can play the recordings. Downloading is available in licensed institutions.").</p>

<p>For anyone into info skills, here's a query to the internet archive that sould make your heart glow: <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:audio%20AND%20collection:opensource_audio%20AND%20/metadata/subject:%22Spoken%20Word%22">http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:audio AND collection:opensource_audio AND /metadata/subject:"Spoken Word"</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to the idea of mashup unartistry, several video shorts by John Monk, a colleague here at the OU, also come to mind...</p>

<p><object height="366" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFOItcYcdFQ6B-A5swgOqJ8X4TCh-Jav0g8="><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFOItcYcdFQ6B-A5swgOqJ8X4TCh-Jav0g8=" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="366" width="425"></object></p>

<p>The point being? Finding a short piece of audio and annotating it with images might be an easy way in to a first a/v mashup...?</p>

<p>Performance wise, I always liked the idea of a <a href="http://www.pandia.com/sew/237-google-jockeying-%E2%80%93-search-engines-in-the-classroom.html">google jockey</a> supplementing a presentation with up to the minute, relevant examples? (Or maybe a guerrilla google jockey using a backchannel to twitter counterfactuals and reminders of previous policy commitments in realtime in a political debate?!)</p>

<p>That said, to really push the boat out, a live vj mix could be, err, different?! (I really should have a play with <a href="http://www.vjamm.com/">VJamm</a> or the <a href="http://www.neuromixer.com/product-avdrum.php">Neuromixer AVdrum</a>, which looks kinda fun (if dated)!)</p>

<p>Ho hum, what fun it must be to be a kid today...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/remix" rel="tag">remix</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/av" rel="tag">av</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mashup" rel="tag"> mashup</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20madness" rel="tag"> madness</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">To Comrades in Non-Programistan - A Message from Feedistan</h3>

To my comrade friends in Non-Programistan, As we approach the third naked CSS day, your declaration of independence based on the founding principles of Friendliness, Openness and Portability brings much hope to the workers here in Feedistan, who have struggled...
<!--
<p>To my comrade friends in Non-Programistan,</p>

<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3174/2391150046_3a06955b03.jpg" width="500" height="110" alt="non-programisatn" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>As we approach the <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">third naked CSS</a> day, your <a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/">declaration of independence</a> based on the founding principles of Friendliness, Openness and Portability brings much hope to the workers here in Feedistan, who have struggled with bringing feeds to the attention of the masses for many years now.</p>

<p>It is a Good Thing that you have done this week and one that I am sure will be rewarded by many fruitful harvests.</p>

<p>I hear tales from many sources that workers from the death camps of Semantic Formalism and Ontologica, that are hidden down dead-ends in many academic temples around the world, are also revolting.</p>

<p>As I write, the Semantic Brethren of the Order of RDF (and - a sore point for a sick man -  I do not mean the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/radicaldancefaction">Radical Dance Faction</a> here) are parading their way down one way streets, into blind alleys that stink of rotten red herrings, whilst pigs that might, do, fly, actually, over the spires of their ivory towers, inside of which, the gorillas in the room are incorrectly identified as white elephants by pragmatic semanticists who are confused by the syntax and the strange use of otherwise everyday vocabulary and frequent commas, not to say overlong sentences likely to score highly (that is, poorly) on even the most academically biased readability scales.</p>

<p>Already, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGcsGPgUTw">protest songs</a> are being smuggled out and workers seeking to find ways to release data, the mined children of data, and the remixed children of the mined children of data that have all been imprisoned since they were first born.</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eGcsGPgUTw&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eGcsGPgUTw&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>Even the current, venerable <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/04/03/iwr-information-professional-of-the-year-2007-article-in-panlibus/">I-Were-I-Poty</a> has started to use artworks to smuggle pictures of the <a href="http://animoto.com/play/e528929409157c05e8f5018751049017">war on terror</a> out of Institutionalia.</p>

<p>Despite your great achievement, let us not forget that all is not well elsewhere in the world, particularly in the <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/03/50reasons.jpg">50 states of Cantdothat</a> and around the foothills of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1805565187/in/set-72157602805227511/">Towers of WS-Babel</a>.</p>

<p>In the shallow waters of ScreenScraperica, fishermen struggle in often turbulent and polluted waters in their search for staple informational needs. We are most gracious for the way in which many of them engage in free trade with Feedistan. (Did you know Yahoo Pipes has ScreenScraperican ancestry on the DataBlock side?)</p>

<p>We encourage polluters of the world to think carefully before publishing contaminated HTML, and instead embrace both the CSS- and X-factors, as well as the clean simplicity of the microformat elixir.</p>

<p>In the PLE jihad, believers are struggling even as we speak to manage their data according to their own beliefs in both Institutionalia and The Cloud - we wish them every success in their mission. Here in Feedistan, we have every confidence that they Cann succeed, as weller. They have many supporters, some who have already publicly revealed themselves, some of whom may do sclater.</p>

<p>In these unsettled times, where <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>, I would urge caution in too hastily blacklisting those whom you perceive as enemies of the state of Non-Programistan.</p>

<p>In Feedistan, all Apparati that consume or produce RSS feeds are welcome, although those that both produce and consume feeds find most favour.</p>

<p>In Feedistan, we agree with not only with the founding principles of Non-Programistan, but also some of the principles of Programistan, which borders on Feedistan also.</p>

<p>Whenever necessary, Feedistan puts to work technology liberated from Programistan. We hope to move forward with them in them in the future through blackbox techniques they have shared with us, in part, through the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014014.html">United Libraries of Progressive Enhancement</a>.</p>

<p>We believe that a universal failing in the educational systems across the landscape has led in part to the widespread ignorance of the state religion of Programistan, and the intolerance many people have for it.</p>

<p>We support the arts of all countries, and are currently seeking an artist capable of bringing light to the black art of regular expressionism  to help promote this most powerful of transformational technologies.</p>

<p>We believe in the ritual cleansing brought forth by the <a href="http://media.nmc.org/2008/04/mashup-un-artist.mp3">Confessions of a Mashup Un-Artist</a> and encourage the telling of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo">Fair(y) Use Tale[s]</a> to our chidren, and our children's children, as they play freely and grazr on the Creative Commons.</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>In Feedistan, we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Non-Programistan, in our shared mission to bring the most precious data and content to the masses, wherever it is located, so that it can be put to work whensoever by whomsoever may have need or use of it, whether in public or in private.</p>

<p>Let us rise up together and with the truths of OLDaily at our side, fight the forces of Closed Protocols &amp; Data Formats, Installed Software, and Platform Speciifc Applications. Let us hope for a period of standards reconciliation in the Browser Wars, and pray that what looks like a tidal wave of migration from Online Appalachia to the nascent Offline Browser App territories will not cause too much bloodshed.</p>

<p>In RESTful friendship, comrades,</p>

<p>Your humble servant,</p>

<p>A peasant worker from Feedistan</p>

<p>Writing the Digital Worlds blog, I was finding the wordcount feature really useful for judging the lengths of the posts... but where's it gone in the new design?</p>

<p>Have I scheduled posts for releaseso that there's a post on on 4th and 5th, as well as the 6th? Have there been posts on the 4th? Can I glance that, or do I have to <em>spend some time working it out?</em></p>

<p>Aaaargghhhh... the new design might have some good features, but I havent found them yet... and I've lost two of the features I realise I was relying on.</p>

<p>The service doesn't appear to have a 'daily feed' shceduler that will provide daily instalments from a static feed (such as an OpenLearn unit content feed). So there's still time for me to get such a generic service first to market!

<p>The OU Courses and quals site has just had a redesign - I'll post about it when I've had a chance to have a proper look around at the changes, but this is sort of related - a marker post to flag an initial attempt at exploring what qualification graphs might look like, as pathfinder preparation for displaying the results of mining some Course Profiles app aggregated data.</p>

<p>The graph below is drawn using the Mac client for <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>, (<a href="http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/">Graphviz for Mac</a>), which takes a simple textual representation of course codes for a particular qualifaction (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01b38">B38 BSc (Honours) Information and Communication Technologies</a>) using the dot syntax for Graphviz, and renders the resulting graph:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2383121853/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2383121853_a94eaea08a.jpg" alt="B38 degree" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="500" width="138" /></a></td>

	]
	edge [

	]

<p>	"T175" -- "M150";<br />
	"M150" -- "MU120" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"M150" -- "MST121" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"MST121" -- "T209" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"MU120" -- "T209" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"T209" -- "T224" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"T224" -- "T320" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"T320" -- "T324" [len = 2.5];<br />
	"T324" -- "T455" [len = 2.5];<br />
}</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br />
Some of the  pathways through other qualifiactions are a bit messy to read, and I need to find a convention for expressing things like "Students who have X123 as their required Level 1 course need at least 60 points from the following list. Students who have X124 as their required Level 2 course need at least 90 points from the following list."</p>

<p>I also need o come up with a convention for representing 10, 20 and 30 point courses etc. (Size of circle would be one option, colour would be another.) The ordered sequence of courses the graph representation implies is also an issue - most OU courses don't have prerequisite courses, though prior courses may be recommended (that is, courses can theoretically be taken in any order). </p>

<p>But it's a start. And the dot language looks easy enough to generate automatically...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/coursegraph" rel="tag">coursegraph</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/qualification%20graph" rel="tag">qualification graph</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>A year or so ago, I started to think it could be a good idea to try and get some sort of appreciation of future studies methods (scenario planning and the like) so I duly worked my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/scenario-planning-second-gill-ringland/dp/047001881x/?tag=" ouseful-21="">Scenario Planning</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Long-View-Planning-Uncertain/dp/0471977853/?tag=ouseful-21">The Art of the Long View</a> and a selection of papers about the <a href="http://www.izt.de/eurendel/scope_of_the_project/delphi_method.html">Delphi Method</a> and so on and.... then never really tried to put any of ithe methods into practise... hmmm.....</p>

<p>Anyway, I recently stumbled across an intriguing sounding paper "Applying Future Studies Methods to Understanding the Impact of University Information and Communication Technology Strategies on Learning" (actually co-authored by James Aczel, an academic here in the OU), scribbled it's DOI (doi:10.2304/elea.2007.4.4.398) on a scrap of paper, and finally got round to downloading it after building a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014020.html">quick libezproxied DOI helper form</a> to do the lifting ;-)<br />
   <br />
The paper analyses the IT strategy teaching and learning support from three universities that are involved with various flavours of distance higher education - the African Virtual University (AVU), the Arab Open University (AOU) and the Syrian Virtual University (SVU) - and characterises the technologies available under various generations of distance learning:<br />
<blockquote>The first generation is print-based correspondence study. The second generation is that of multimedia, in which print was integrated with television and radio broadcasts, video and audio cassettes, and, later, desktop software. The third generation is that of 'telelearning', largely based on audio-conferencing and video-conferencing via telecommunications technologies. Descriptions of proposed subsequent generations ...  might now be collectively referred to under the label 'e-learning'. For example, ... the fourth generation [might be described] as the 'flexible learning model', largely using the Internet to deliver courseware and to support asynchronous written communication (and sometimes audio-conferencing and videoconferencing). ... [It] allows multimedia, multi-interactive, multimodal and multi-collaborative learning to take place in the vast majority of homes in such countries.</p>

<p>... [a] fifth generation is currently emerging (the 'intelligent flexible learning model'), in which institutional services are provided via the Internet, and in which systems use course materials and past interactions between students and tutors as the basis for firstpass automated responses. ...</p>

<p>A sixth generation, also emerging, is ubiquitous mobile access to multimedia learning (freeing distance education from the fixed physical locations of hardware), and the routine expectation that students engage in discussions with tutors and peers not only via asynchronous text but also via synchronous video.</blockquote>Here's the summary table of the above, taken directly from the paper:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2380657613/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2371/2380657613_6188ff5d21.jpg" alt="Aczel TAL ICT Futures" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="220" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The paper plots these various technologies on a variety of charts, (in particular, on charts with globalisation vs. individual-social dimensions, and globalisation vs. individual reflection dimensions) but what I wanted to flag here was the following diagram, which plots technologies against information-experience and (learner) autonomy axes, identifying four possible distance university scenarios as a result:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2380659763/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2340/2380659763_8f2589b1e3.jpg" alt="Aczel ICT TAL Future scenarios" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="415" width="500" /></a></p>

<blockquote>The 'easyUniversity' scenario (with apologies to the founder of EasyJet, Stelios Haji-Ioannou) is based on increasing the effectiveness and convenience of the presentation of information. The aim is to enable students to purchase self-contained highquality training packages, without fuss or frills. The 'easyUniversity' is based on information and does not demand much student autonomy.

<p>The 'professional school' scenario, meanwhile, is more about the training that lawyers, doctors, business managers and teachers seek. The professional school differs from the easyUniversity in terms of the balance between experience and information. It is not simply enough to have information presented effectively and conveniently; there needs to be a practical element that allows the trainee to experience something of what it means to be a professional, and to develop a range of practical skills. The professional school is based on experience and constrains student autonomy to the reflections made on practical experience.</p>

<p>The 'Google university' differs from the easyUniversity in terms of student autonomy. The Google university envisions a world of rich materials, which students search for themselves. Far from being pre-packaged, these materials lend themselves to a variety of uses, and students locate and sequence these materials by means of automatic facilities that parse and interpret text, images, usage histories, ratings given by others and correlations with successful learning outcomes. The Google university is based on information and gives the student much autonomy.</p>

<p>Finally, the 'AI campus' scenario focuses on student learning from thoroughgoing intellectual engagement. Like the Google university, there is high student autonomy; but unlike the Google university, learning comes directly from the feedback provided by open-ended projects, experiments, simulations and gameworlds, rather than from documents or media clips. The AI campus shares with the professional school a concern to facilitate experience, but since the focus is not so clearly vocational, the AI campus emphasises student autonomy over mastery of predefined knowledge and skills. The AI campus is based on experience and gives the student some autonomy.</blockquote>I can't remember what the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/ou-futures/environment-prospects.shtm">OU Futures scenarios</a> that were produced a few years ago identified, but I think it'd be interesting to compare them to the above... [two reasons for looking at OU futures scenarios again, actually: 1) to see how the HE landscape scenarios identified a couple of years ago are playing out today; 2) to see how robust the above distance HE models are in the context of the OU futures scenarios...]</p>
