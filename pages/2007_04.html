<h3 class="title">Disaggregating an MIT OpenCourseware Course into Separate RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>Picking up on a couple of points raised in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010211.html">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</a>, I've atomised the MIT OpenCourse Course <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a>  a little further and replaced some of the OPML items with RSS feeds.</p>

<p>In particular, I've replaced the list of video games with a feed containing those items pulled from an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/MITOCW-CMS610-Games/lm/R2356SXQHQ8XBJ/">Amazon Listmania list</a> via a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">third party Listmania2RSS service</a> (which I've used before in a similar context: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009154.html">OpenLearn/OCW Reading Lists</a>).</p>

<p>I've also created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1751CECCEFC5615C">youTube channel</a> with trailers/reviews of some of the example video games mentioned in the course. Applying the bookmarklet mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</a> to the youTube channel page creates a static snapshot (i.e. not live:-( RSS feed of the playlist, which can also be mixed into the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">course OPML</a> (or <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=on&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">view the course via grazr</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="mitocwdemo2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitocwdemo2.png" width="794" height="579" border="0" /></p>

<p>Finally, I added another Listmania list, this time for the books cited in the course.</p>

<p>..and as an afterthought, a link to a delicious feed pointing to a list of bookmarks of the books on the reading list that appear in Google Books. [Latency on replicating bookmarks across the delicious servers is really becoming an issue, methinks?]</p>

<p>Whilst I haven't done this (yet!), it's trivial to pipe the Listmania lists into an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">online shop</a>, courtesy of something like Amazon aStores.</p>

<p>This incremental disaggregation approach (?!) is a route I'm keen on exploring further as a way of identifying patterns that can be used <em>in reverse</em> as <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/just-try-it-mister/">exemplar mashup strategies</a>, by aggregating content from reusable raw components, rather than disaggregating it into reusable component parts.</p>

<p>The disaggregation step does, however, have the beneficial side effect  of producing reusable components from effectively closed (i.e. not trivially mashable or remixable) open content ;-)</p>

<p>PS for another take on educational mashup activity, check out the <a href="http://openconnectedsocial.learningparty.net/wiki/page/Mashups">Open, Connected, and Social: mashups</a> wiki page.</p>

<h3 class="title">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</h3>

<p>Over the weekend, I noticed that MIT OpenCourseWare courses were offering a "Download this Course" option. Intrigued, I immediately grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a> course and had a poke around inside it.</p>

<p>The download bundle is - I guess(?!) - a standard (?) IMS  - err - package? (can you tell I'm not up on educational material interoperability standards?!;-)</p>

<p>That is to say, the zip archive file opens into a set of nested directories with an <em>imsmanifest.xml</em> document.  The archive file also contained copies of the HTML pages used on the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">course website</a> as well as the PDF versions of the course lecture notes.</p>

<p>What I <em>had</em> been hoping for was a 'clean' XML version of the course webpages (i.e. a single source document from which they had been generated). Some hope!</p>

<p>Anyway, my initial enthusiasm curbed somewhat, I felt there was still some mileage to be made in RSSifiying the course, for three main reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly to see if what came out was "sensible" - i.e. whether a feed based version of the course could be sensibly viewed in a <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> or <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a> environment, for example.</p>

<p>Secondly, to get a feeling for how to decompose a feed-delivered version of the course into separate component feeds.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to see whether those component feeds could be automatically generated from the IMS manifest, or scraped from the MIT OpenCourseware web pages.</p>

<p>The course - as published on the MIT OpenCourseWare website - is structured according to the course syllabus, readings, lecture notes, projects (i.e. group and individual activities) and related resources.</p>

<p><img alt="mitHTML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitHTML.png" width="802" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>As a first pass, I have generated an OPML version of the course that follows a similar structure. At the moment, this OPML feed is - to all intents and purposes - a monolithic feed. Over the coming weeks I intend to disaggregate it into separate component feeds that can be reaggregated in an OPML feed that pulls in separate OPML and RSS component feeds.</p>

<p>You can view the OPML version of the course here: <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=off&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo.opml">MIT OCW CMS610 Spring, 2006, Comparative Media (via Grazr)</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="mitOPML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitOPML.png" width="911" height="317" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that at the current time, some of the links (to New York Times) resources require a NYT login. I will patch these as and when I can. In addition, the links to audio-visual resources should really be made available via an embedded player, as well as link to the original site.</p>

<p>A cursory scan of the OpenCourseWare site suggests that the way individual web pages are composed across different courses is rather arbitrary, which will make scraping the site to automate feed production somewhat tricky.</p>

<p>I should be thankful for small mercies in the way OpenLearn content is bundled as XML I suppose!</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/resistance-is-fertile/">this is spot on</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Innovating from the Inside, Outside</h3>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, the OU hosted a workshop with several external consultants about OUr visionary future web strategy (presumably?) <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/04/new_university_.html">Martin Weller</a> gave the heads-up, <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/work/2007/04/open_universiti.html">Stowe Boyd</a> (one of the consultants) added a bit more detail - like suggesting this is an ongoing project - and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/04/new_university__1.html">Martin responded</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I can't find any documentation internally on this workshop/project (yet!) - though even if I could, it'd probably have to remain behind the firewall... (along with the new <em>VCE Dashboard</em> (internal readers can find a link on intranet home page, in one of the right hand navigation column panels...;-)).</p>

<p>[What follows is all a bit <em>I and me, and me and I</em>, for which I (!) apologise - but I (!?) don't really want to rewrite it all in a neutral voice just now...]</p>

<p>One thing that struck me about this workshop that the ideas are coming from the <em>outside, in</em>, which contrasts with something I've been meaning to post for some time now: <em>inside, outside</em> working...</p>

<blockquote>There's no way I could have made any of the OUseful/OpenLearn toys (like <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, or the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn<em>_XMLProcessor</em></a>, for example) <em>until</em> the OpenLearn project made the XML course unit files available under an open content/Creative Commons license.</blockquote>

<p>For example, there was no way of getting XML versions of course materials that I could play with and publish on the <em>public</em> web.</p>

<p>That isn't to say that internally access wasn't available to XML structured content: for example, the OU short courses are generated from XML source documents (although these are not defined at the unit level - they use an XML document format defined at the <em>page</em> level - which I've argued against for the last 3 or 4 years...!).</p>

<p>It's just that being able to play with content that is still being delivered to students in live courses is just not done...</p>

<p>And of course, there are 'technical issues' too - materials locked behind an OU firewall require authentication before they can be viewed (even XML files). Which means that using third party tools to process them isn't really possible...</p>

<p>(The fact that many of the services I'm using didn't actually exist even a few months ago is neither here or there... it's also worth bearing in mind that quite a few of the third party services used in OUseful apps have benefitted (maybe?!) from feedback I've been able to provide as a result of using those apps for OUseful demos. In addition, OUseful tinkering has also generated more than a few feature requests and bug reports to third party services and maybe, maybe, contributed implicitly to knowledge transfer activity, albeit untracked.)</p>

<p>Another advantage of <em>inside, outside</em> working is that I've been able to bring to bear my knowledge of how OU courses are designed and put together to be able to atomise/disaggregate them in ways that hopefully make sense (e.g. by RSSifying the content).</p>

<p>I guess I can also justify the considerable amount of time I spend in OUseful displacement activity on OpenLearn related activites <em>because</em> I work for the OU (even though I am not part of the OpenLearn project). Again, an <em>inside</em> justifcation for this.</p>

<p>The power of working from the <em>outside</em>, of course, is that <em>anyone</em> could be doing this stuff - and I can't be <em>stopped</em> from doing it (in my own time, of course; hmmm....)</p>

<p>Partly for this reason, I try to ensure that OUseful doodle apps do not require any privileged access to Open University services (just like I try to ensure that news I post on this public blog can be found on the OU public website... okay, maybe I find the info on the intranet first, and then look for a public route in to it, but hey, at the end of the day it's the public who's paying for what we do...;-)</p>

<p>In many cases, an OU server <em>is</em> used to host stuff; but wherever possible, tools are written using client-side Javascript to implement functionality (and making "View Source" trivial), relayed RSS feeds/JSON used to ensure that clients don't suffer form proxy/security problems arising from trying to access feeds from OU domains, and so on.</p>

<p>So: one of the biggest payoffs for me about OpenLearn is that it allows me to indulge in <em>inside, outside</em> working.</p>

<p>For example, there's no problem using third party tools, services and applications in the services I want to develop.</p>

<p>It also means that skunkworks and side projects can be entertained <em>without</em> having to worry about leaking copyrighted/rights protected materials, for example - or having to obtain permission to try out various novel delivery models using either the materials <em>or</em> external, third party tools.</p>

<p>And because the materials are there, and freely available, <em>anyone</em> can use them...</p>

<p>...which includes - and this may come as a surprise to many - people <em>on the inside</em>...</p>

<p>So the general lesson here is that if an organisation opens up its content or services, for example, then its employees can innovate with those resources <em>without</em> the need for official sanction...</p>

<p>...if, that is, they have 20% time (or study leave, in the OU case), or they are prepared to burn a bit of midnight oil.</p>

<p>So for me, then, the opening up of content (and services) also opens up <em>inside, outside</em> working opportunities, enabling individuals who want to try out work-related innovation that the institution won't necessarily allocate resource to, to pursue that <em>internal</em> innovation <em>outside</em> the confines of work (in all the forms those confines take).</p>

<p>NB note that none of this applies if you have a life, do the work you are supposed to do, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/386-dont-be-a-hero-giving-up-is-good">don't  need to be a hero</a> etc! ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Unit Search Hub</h3>

<p>Picking up on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010189.html">previous post</a>, I knocked up a Yahoo Pipe that will use an OpenLearn course unit as an <em>outlinks <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005914.html">search hub</a></em>, demonstrating an automated way of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">extracting value from a course unit</a>: <em><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=CsnuX5Tu2xGWTorhJhOy0Q">OpenLearn Unit Outlinks Search Hub Pipe</a></em></p>

<p>The pipe uses this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkStripperRSS.xsl">OpenLearn link stripper XSLT</a> to extract all the outgoing links from a course unit, then feeds these into a Yahoo Search pipe, which uses the domains as search limits for the search (just as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009969.html">deliSearch</a> does with links pulled in from delicious and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010000.html">searchfeedr</a> does with links pulled in from an arbitrary feed:</p>

<p>I'll add a link to a Grazrscript form for this search pipe to this post when I get a chance to cobble one together.</p>

<p>I'll also have to try and find 10 mins somewhere to add it to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn<em>_XMLProcessor</em></a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Enterprise Search Appliance Powered Custom Search</h3>

<p>As part of the OU's ongoing federated search project, a query just came round asking for thoughts about including results from a third party web search engine as one of the results options. Presumably this would mean adding additional options to the <a href="http://css2.open.ac.uk/search/search.aspx">current interface</a>.</p>

<p>For example, another option here:</p>

<p><img alt="ouFedSearch1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouFedSearch1.png" width="524" height="240" border="0" /></p>

<p>and another results tab here, maybe?</p>

<p><img alt="ouFedSearch2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouFedSearch2.png" width="502" height="249" border="0" /></p>

<p>In fact, (quick aside!), just look at those results a little more closely...</p>

<p><img alt="ouFedSearch3.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouFedSearch3.png" width="476" height="560" border="0" /></p>

<p>See these?</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01TU120">http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01TU120 - 27.3K</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02TU120">http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C02TU120 - 27.2K</a></li>

<p>Customised pages with an additional pricing info column for particular territories: CO1i - Ireland; CO1w - Other Countries; CO1e - Continental Europe:</p>

<p><img alt="ouIntlCourseReg.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouIntlCourseReg.png" width="814" height="210" border="0" /></p>

<p>(I'm not sure what the significance of CO1 and CO2 is? Maybe next and next but one presentation when they are less than 6 months or so apart? I donlt know.... CO2 works with the territory switches, though, so I could have listed far more results....)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - who gives a !$%&! about those duplicate entries? Why use those results items/screen real estate in such a wasteful way?! Aaargggghhh...</p>

<p>Here's one way that multiple hits for the same course might be addressed - sublinks for the different territories off a primary hit:</p>

<p><img alt="ouMultipleHits.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouMultipleHits.png" width="547" height="155" border="0" /></p>

<p>Okay - back to the preamble to the point of the post...</p>

<p><em>If</em> results from a third party search engine were to be included as a results listing in this way, what criteria would be used to choose the provider? There are obviously opportunities for a commercial partnership... or would this bring a potential bias into the provision of web search results?</p>

<p>(There's a corollary, too, maybe?, in the area of the library's own federated academic search tool, too - should Google Scholar and Wndows Live Academic be included in the listings? Or is that different.....?! ;-)</p>

<p>Technically, there is the issue of how the results are actually pulled in and displayed - via an API, presumably, which would be okay if all the players offered a SOAP or XML returning RESTful API... (And would branding from the search engine have to be displayed to comply API T&C? If so, how prominently?)</p>

<p>The matter of sponsored/paid for links is another issue, depending on which search engine is used to provide web search results. Would these have a place in an OU published page? Or maybe there's an opportunity to get a bit of revenue in... dangerous territory, methinks...</p>

<p>My immediate thought was that a custom search engine might be the way to go, e.g. using something like <a href="http://google.com/coop/cse/">Google Custom Search Engine</a> for a quick'n'dirty proof of concept.</p>

<p>This could be domain limited over all the outlinks from OU course materials and research papers for example, or even just by extracting *all* linked to domains from *all* the docs on the <em>.open.ac.uk</em> domain, and then using these to seed the custom search engine?</p>

<p>(Memories of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003234.html">Social ROUTES</a> spring to mind here, as well as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</a>.)</p>

<p>In fact, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of developing an OU custom search engine. If nothing else, it would allow us to make a claim about leading the way in enterprise powered, social search engines and maybe get a bit of press out of it?! ;-)</p>

<p>It could also be built up from 'satellite' course-powered search engines.</p>

<p>We could maybe even get a partnership project going with one of the big search co's?</p>

<p>For example, if the <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/">Google search appliances</a> can scrape links from an internal network and then feed these directly into a Google custom search engine, you have a really quick way of generating a custom web search engine.</p>

<p>Yes - there are dangers that you isolate yourself from those bits of the web you don't link to from your site, but that could be addressed in part by adding the domains that link in to your site as additional custom search limits?</p>

<p>And for the full web search experience, you could just use Google Google anyway... (but even there, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009922.html">Google ground truth can be optionally personalised away</a>...).</p>

<h3 class="title">open.ac.uk Goes Nowhere...</h3>

<p>Four or five years ago, whenever you'd hear someone giving out a URL, they'd start out by saying: "H T T P colon slash slash W W W dot..." and so on...</p>

<p>Two or three years ago, the 'http://' requirement largely became deprecated. Instead, you knew it a URL was being given out because it would start 'W W W'.</p>

<p>One or two years ago, most websites made the 'www.' optional. For example, I typically use the form <em>example.com</em> when I want to enter the URL of a site...</p>

<p>...and more often than not it works okay...</p>

<p>... but not,  (currently: 19/4/07), with <a href="http://open.ac.uk">open.ac.uk</a> ...</p>

<p>Ho hum....</p>

<p>PS I don't think people even bother giving URLs now, do they? "Just google <em>open university</em> and you should find it..."</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Releases Promo Video on YouTube</h3>

<p><a href="http://library20.ning.com/xn/detail/515108:BlogPost:16156">Stuart Brown</a> tipped me off yesterday to what I believe is the first 'official' institutional upload by the OU to YouTube - and it comes from the OpenLearn team:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydF-rRqqh-U">OpenLearn - free educational materials from the OU</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ydF-rRqqh-U"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ydF-rRqqh-U" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<blockquote>Back in February this year, openlearn was <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/news/news-full.php?id=10576">selected</a> as a finalist in <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/learningimpact/">IMS Global Learning Consortium's Learning Impact Recognition and Awards Program</a>. Our entry received full marks from judges in the area of Expanded Access: Impact on reaching new populations of learners (amongst others) and was judged to be 'a true innovation in open access'.

<p>... we had to create the movie as a part of the final judging process</blockquote></p>

<p>...and in fact, it seems they've won a prize...<br />
<blockquote>OpenLearn has won a platinum award – the top honour - at the IMS Global Learning Consortium Learning Impact Awards 2007. The award was announced yesterday at the conference in Vancouver where Stephen Bradley, Technical and Production Director was exhibiting OpenLearn. The judges evaluated the project on learner achievement, impact on faculty adoption, financial return, impact on access, impact on accountability, and use of interoperability standards.</blockquote></p>

<p>Way to go chaps... (can you imagine how many awards OpenLearn would be winning if you <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010124.html">RSSified the content</a>, too...?!;-)</p>

<p>It seems that OpenLearn has also been reader nominated to the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/nma/nma2007/nominations/200703300001">New Statesman New Media Awards</a>... ;-)</p>

<p>If I was in the central OU communications team, I'd be watching the OpenLearn comms team closely... because they get it...</p>

<p>...although I do wonder at what point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Media_Optimization">Social Media Optimisation</a> and related activities become corporate spam...?</p>

<h3 class="title">Time for TechCrunch, Academic?</h3>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/15/fotowoosh-will-turn-any-picture-into-3d-image/">TechCrunch</a> reported on <a href="http://fotowoosh.com/">fotowoosh</a>, a service that "will turn any picture into a 3D image".</p>

<p>I blogged about this a bit ago whilst it was known as the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007032.html">popup project</a>, a research project developed by Derek Hoiem out of CMU.</p>

<p>(Microsoft are also developing something similar - <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSYnth</a>.)</p>

<p>Replying to comments on one of his <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=39831">own posts</a>, Stephen Downes writes:<br />
<blockquote>Having been around enough to have seen some history (and still a bit surprised to be in such a position) I would suggest that most of the 'innovations' brought to us by Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft, YouTube etc. originated in academic environments and were copied by the corporations in question. In some cases, the corporation itself had its genesis in an academic environment.</blockquote></p>

<p>I quite agree... and with the commoditisation of web scalable infrastructure that you pay for as you use it (think Amazon web sevices, <a href="http://zimki.com">Zimki</a> and so on) I wonder whether the trend will be towards increasing numbers of academic projects spinning out of the lab (or maybe even course project work?) and into beta?</p>

<p>So  - maybe there's scope for a <em>TechCrunch Academic</em>, that can cover neat stuff going on in academic research labs and help out with academics' often neglected public engagement and knowledge transfer activities.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, of course some of this stuff gets talked about and demoed at academic conferences, but often it languishes at project's end.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe a bit of techbuzz at the right time could spur on academic innovation and entrepeneurship, as well as pure research?</p>

<p>PS have you seen the new, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/04/17/msg-now-with-google-maps-moodle-options/">Google maps presence enhanced MSG messaging client</a>?</p>

<h3 class="title">CFP: First International M-Libraries Conference, 13-14 November, 2007</h3>

<p>I'm not sure <em>how</em> the <em> First International M-Libraries Conference</em> (no link? ah - here maybe: <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/index.cfm?wpid=7150">IMLC-07</a>(?!;-)) is being advertised, although the first I heard of it officially was via an internal email today with a plea: "The Open University Library is arranging an M-Libraries conference in November and we are looking for papers to include. So far we haven't received any submissions from Open University staff outside the library. " </p>

<p>Hmmm - this call must only have reached those parts of the blogosphere I don't inhabit... (but then, I don't tend to track the mobile stuff...)</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the call if - like with me - it missed your radar...</p>

<h3 class="title">Embedding youTube Movies in "Commercial" elearning Materials</h3>

<p>One of the things I (supposedly) do when not tinkering with Web 2.0 toys is look after an introductory OU short course on <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t184">robotics</a>.</p>

<p>Robotics as a subject area is pretty well suited to making reuse of 3rd party content to illustrate points, especially in an online course: movies and images are order of the day, as you might imagine:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q0ubRMw8L8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q0ubRMw8L8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>The question is, could I legitimately embed a youTube movie (assuming I could verify that it was a 'legitimately' uploaded video, of course;-) in course materials that are only viewable by registered (i.e. fee paying) students?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms">youTube T&C</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>F. YouTube permits you to link to materials on the Website for personal, non-commercial purposes only. In addition, YouTube provides an "Embeddable Player" feature, which you may incorporate into your own personal, non-commercial websites for use in accessing the materials on the Website, provided that you include a prominent link back to the YouTube website on the pages containing the Embeddable Player. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the YouTube Website at any time.</blockquote></p>

<p>So is an OU online course a commercial service? Can I embed a movie under the above condition or not?</p>

<p>If anyone is has tried to get youTube movies embedded in an online course and/or has taken advice from their rights department on this topic (as I am about tto do) I'd be interested in hearing how you got on...</p>

<p>Similarly, if anyone is using <em>any</em> third party service as an integral part of their course (flickr, maybe?), how did you get on?</p>

<p>I know there were discussions here at the OU about the possibility of getting students to use flickr in our new <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography short course</a>, with an OU developed front end plugged into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">flickr API</a>.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason, that route wasn't taken and instead a flickr clone was built in-house. (I'm not sure what sort of export options or sharing support/API is available though? In the time available for development, I'd guess flickr offers more... and I don't know whether the storage space is capped, either?)</p>

<p>Whilst rights aren't my strong thing, I could imagine that the following would be treated differently:</p>

<p>1) a course team/instructor getting a youTube movie (or flickr slideshow etc.) embedded in some formally delivered elearning materials;</p>

<p>2) a student embedding a youTube movie in a personal, course related blog post using a blogging system provided by their HEI to support their studies.</p>

<p>I don't know if things get trickier if, in the second case, the blog post is only viewable behind an HEI firewall/student registration required "paywall", compared to a situation where the blog is public?</p>

<p>Just by the by, this idea of PLE vs VLE published content ties in with the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">String'n'Glue Learning Environment</a> appproach, as well as the notion of <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002885.html">"distributed content publishing"</a>: <em>"The challenge with the distributed content model (the notion that educational content comes to the learner's space, rather than the learner coming to a space decided by the educational facility) is that it runs against the in-grained assumptions of our value point in higher education or corporate environments.</em>"]</p>

<p>I have to admit that inspiration deserts me at the moment about where to go for advice on the issue of "can I/can't I embed 3rd party widget serving content" outside of the OU, (in part given I couldn't find any way of mailing youTube support;-)? JISC (err... which bit?)? <a href="http://www.cetis.ac.uk/">CETIS</a> (because this is all about reuse, right?;-)?</p>

<p>PS as well as looking for tales about using flickr'n'youTube like content/services as an integral part of an elearning course, I also need to play catch-up with how social bookmarking is being used for real in K12-HEI education <em>by the students</em>. Any and all pointers, war stories etc. appreciated - feel free to tag stuff for me (<em>psychemedia</em>) on delicious...;-0</p>

<p>PS I just spotted over on the Google Blog that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-expecting.html">presentations will soon be added to the Google docs'n'spreadsheets mix</a>...</p>

<h3 class="title">Structured Bookmarking: From MicroFormats to Machine Tags</h3>

<p>Increasingly, I've found I'm using my delicious social bookmarking accounts as simple place for collecting resources that I can then annotate with 'functionally useful' tags - such as <em>geotags</em> that let me <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html">plot feed items onto a Google or Yahoo map</a>.</p>

<p>But as I find I want to do more and more from my delicious account, I think I need to look around to see what's been happening (if anything) in the emergence of 'semantic' tagging standards. Here are my starting points:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/">flickr machine tags</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> - if possible, I think it would be a "Good Thing" if machine tags/semantic tags/microtags?/structured tags?/tagformats? closely resembled microformats...;</li>
<li><a href="http://structuredblogging.org/">structured blogging</a>.</li></ul>

<p>As it's been some time since I looked round the state of the art in terms of social bookmarking services, I also need to do a quick survey to see whether any of the services are offering 'structured bookmarking' forms that facilitate the data entry of structured tags (if not, I guess I need to write some bookmarklets;-)</p>

<p>So, if you of any services that already support structured bookmarking, please drop me a line...</p>

<h3 class="title">Visualising Geo-temporal RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>After a week away from the web (:-) I thought I'd have a quick play with some new 'visualisations' of geo-coded RSS feeds using Yahoo and Google maps presented in the same browser view as a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">timeline</a> of the associated feed, in part prompted by some of <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/04/technological_e.html">Martin Weller's sideways reflections on using Google maps in education</a>.</p>

<p>The demo app I had in mind was to show a simple travel blog with dual visualisations - mapped and timelined using split screen iframes, the timeline in the top third, the map in the bottom two thirds - BUT I couldn't find a geo-coded, timestamped feed that would work in the timeline and mapping apps...</p>

<p>So until I manage to cobble my own demo feed together (which won't actually take that long to do, but you know how it goes...!), here's what I have in mind:</p>

<p>Given a geo-coded RSS feed, visualise it using either the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/georss/index.html">Yahoo geoRSS2map API</a> or the <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/03/kml-and-georss-support-added-to-google.html">Google geoRSS2map API</a> (the <a href="http://www.acme.com/GeoRSS/about.html">ACME GeoRSS Map Viewer</a> will generate map links for both of these services when passed a GeoRSS URL).</p>

<p>Using the same feed, visualise it temporally using the <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">Simile timeline widget</a> via something like the <a href="http://timeline.to/">Universal [RSS to] Timeline Generator</a> or this customisable service from <a href="http://www.mytimelines.net/create-a-timeline/">My Timelines</a> (who also have an <a href="http://www.mytimelines.net/create-an-icalendar-timeline/">experimental iCal feed to timeline generator</a>). These services actually use the timestamp of each feed item to locate the item title along the timeline (I think), which is why I thought of using a travel blog for the demo - my assumptions about travelblog postings being that they are posted <em>at or near the time of event recorded</em> as well as being <em>appropriately geotagged</em>.</p>

<p>Several opportunities for tying the geo and temporal interfaces together also suggest themselves.</p>

<p>For example, if items on the displayed timeline are colour coded along a red/blue spectrum, say, along the timeline, then corresponding map markers could be similarly color coded, giving you on the map a 2+1D representation (space + time), with a cross reference back to the timeline.</p>

<p>The Yahoo map interface is interesting in that only text links to items in the current geo view are listed (allowing you to navigate items by the map view). A similar control could be added to the timeline so that only items in the current timeline view are displayed on the currently displayed displayed map. (With maybe options for only displaying in the timeline items on the current geo view - and various combinations thereof).</p>

<p>Hovering over items on the map/timeline might also cause the corresponding item on the timeline/map to be highlighted.</p>

<p>Using these tools in combination with each other thus offers the potential for a powerful <em>visual</em> interface using historical and/or spatial context.</p>

<p>What's really needed then, of course, would be a third window (or pop-up window, maybe in a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">lightbox</a>?) to display the description text for a particular feed item when it is selected either from the map <em>or</em> the timeline.</p>

<p>On the to do list is a Yahoo pipe that will take a <em>geotagged</em> social bookmarking feeds (using the <em>geo:lat=* geo:long=*</em>) strategy, and produce a valid geoRSS feed as a result. In addition, the Pipe should also be able to handle a <em>datetime=*</em> tag applied to each bookmark and then rewrite the feed item timestamp with <em>this</em> time... So for example I could <em>datetime=</em> or <em>dt=</em> tag an article relating to an English Civil War battle with the date of the battle, have the feed rewritten with this datetime as the item posting time, and <em>then</em> have the feed items displayed appropriately on a timeline (unless the timeline widget could consume a datetime tag directly, that is).</p>

<p>It's maybe also worth mentioning that the Microsoft Windows Live empire also has various forms of GeoRSS support, as this post on <a href="http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!8495.entry">Live Search Maps</a> describes.</p>

<p>In particular, the Microsoft service lets you 'bookmark' collections of locations (a bit like the new <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html">Google MyMaps</a> service, I guess), and publish a public, geoRSS feed from these collections. (Note that this is a <em>take home</em> point: <em>Windows Live Search maps lets you create location collections with geoRSS feeds</em>).</p>

<p>As far as consuming geoRSS, the <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/default.aspx?app=virtual_earth">Virtual Earth Map Control</a> is happy with this sort of input, but I think it only works on a Windows O/S with 3D support (i.e. not on Windows under <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> on a Mac...).</p>

<p>PS Okay - so someone has sort of done this before: the <a href="http://www.oe-files.de/gmaps/usgseq.html">USGS Live Earthquake mashup</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="gmaptimeline.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gmaptimeline.png" width="732" height="502" border="0" /></p>

<p>This approach (timeline+maps) seems to me like a powerful strategy for collecting resources whilst researching an essay topic, for example, with the added advantages that: a) the visualisation may help structure/organise the essay; b) used to illustrate the topic and maybe even provide a visual navigation scheme through it...</p>

<h3 class="title">Openlearn XML Processor</h3>

<p>Okay folks, I'm gonna have to trust you to be nice with this one, because every time you play with, it hits someone else's server...</p>

<p>What is it? My first attempt at an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn XML Processor</a> "solution", that's what...</p>

<p>Now before Stephen Downes hollers about the server hits (;-) this is a proof of concept thing, okay? A demo. To act as something I can pick apart in front of people to try and show them how it's put together...</p>

<p>So what's it do?</p>

<p>Well - put in the URL to an OpenLearn XML file (you can host them on your own server after downloading them from <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a>, which requires you to register for the course and blah de blah de blah...) - or just stick in the unit code to one of the files I've alredy liberated - and the processor will (if it's working ;-):<br />
<ul><li>generate a link to a URL that uses a script to generate an OPML file that lists the media assets contained in the unit (L120_1 is a good demo of this (as reported previously in this post on  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">OpenLearn Asset Stripping</a>); a link to a Grazr view of the file is also generated;</li><br />
<li>generate a link to an RSS version of the course unit (as well as a link to a Grazr previewer); the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearn2rss.xsl">stylesheet</a> is still a bit ropey, but it's good enough for (some) demos; I'm having all sorts of problems with the character set, so if someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, that'd be much appreciated (it's something I've never really looked at).  The translation works by passing the XML file URL to a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=0F8Z_y7d2xGkWV9fnkartA">Yahoo pipe</a> that runs the XML through the W3C XML processor using the previously mentioned style sheet to generate the RSS output;</li><br />
<li>generate a link to a PDF version of the unit. This is achieved by plugging the URL for the OUXML2RSS Yahoo pipe (which has the  course XML URL as an argument, of course) into the <a href="http://www.rss2pdf.org">RSS2PDF.org</a> web service. The steps to generate the PDF, then, are: provide the URL of the XML, use a Yahoo pipe to send this to the W3C XSL processor with an appropriate style file, take the resulting RSS output from the Yahoo pipe and shove it into rss2pdf; (it should then be possible to pass this to a pdf2audio service, etc;-);</li><br />
<li>wire the live created RSS file into my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009972.html">serialised feeds service</a>. This service takes the serialised feed delivery configuration information provided via a web form, and uses that information - along with the current  time stamp - to work out how many items to deliver to the user. The service passes this required item count, along with a URL to the unit XML file to the Yahoo OUXML2RSS pipe that runs the XML through the W3C XSL processor along with a supplied XSL file), and then passes <em>this</em> generated feed to a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=XPfTMuTP2xGUL12c3C7BQA">feed serialiser pipe</a> (which is nothing of the sort really - all it does it count out a required nubner of feed items). Simple. :-) and stupid - because the W3C processor has to run every time the feed is polled.</li></ul></p>

<p>Okay - so maybe I need to work on the delivery of that explanation a little... and draw some pictures;-)</p>

<p>Or maybe write it up using the new draft proposal for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc: An XML Pipeline Language</a>. Because as I'm sure you all know, "[a]n XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be performed on one or more XML documents, producing one or more XML documents as output."</p>

<p>Also when I get a chance, I'll write an OpenLearn RSS Exploiter that uses a pre-generated/saved version of the RSS files to play around with the RSS (converting it to PDFs, audio, etc., as well as providing badges to one-click it into Netvibes, Google Personal, etc.).</p>

<p>But not today - I need to pack - going away for a week (so there'll be no posts for a bit...)...</p>

<h3 class="title">Coherent Design Across Web Apps</h3>

<p>Andy Rush of the <a href="http://umwdtlt.org/newmedia">UMW New Media Center</a> has just released a consistent style/design across their <a href="http://andheblogs.andyrush.net/?p=244">WordPress blog and MediaWiki wiki</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://andheblogs.andyrush.net/wp-content/photos/umwnmc.jpg" /></p>

<p>The new site provides the user with a consistent and coherent style/form of navigation across the two apps.</p>

<p>With more and more apps allowing users to define their own skin/theme, the UMW new media site shows how - in principle - unified styling could be achieved across applications emebedded within a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a> container.</p>

<p>This means I really need to: a) start identifying those stringle:tools (apps that work okay in an iframe ;-) that support user themes/styles/skins; and b) start thinking about a simple visual theme that will let me demo a proof of concept, coherent design stringle:profile.</p>

<p>At least two other pieces are required for a fully coherent stringle experience as well, though:</p>

<p>1) single sign on - OpenID may provide a way forward here?</p>

<p>2) interoperability between applications - so documents and content can be passed seemlessly from one app to another.</p>

<p>There are already glimpses of interoperability available, provide by the apps themselves - the ability to bookmark user created/customised pages on delicious for example (what I call 'roundtripping' in stringle - the ability to bookmark a a user created page in such a way that it becomes available in the stringle navigation widget), or the ability to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010107.html">open linked to office docs online using Zoho</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Re:Play - The Future of Sports Gaming? "I'll Take it From Here..."</h3>

<p>In a neat post on the question of whether <a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2007/04/will_virtual_representations_o.php">virtual representations of sporting events [will] become part of the online rights economy</a>, Martin Belam describes the use of <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/3d/">Cricinfo 3D</a> to provide over-by-over cricket match coverage:<br />
<blockquote>Rather than just describing the action in near real-time, they show you, using a game engine to simulate the match being played... As each ball in the over is bowled, a Shockwave plug-in on the web-page illustrates the action.<br />
You can select the camera angle you want to view the action from, either choosing TV style coverage, a fixed position like from the stumps, or a view through the bowler or the batsman's eyes, or from the point of view of the wicket keeper.</blockquote><br />
I've sort posted on this topic <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005939.html">before</a>, and see Cricinfo 3D as being another indicator along the path to "I'll take it from here" video gaming.</p>

<p>By that, I mean sports simulations in which the state of the game at which the player starts is a duplicate of the state of the game in the real world.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>- in a cricket sim, rather than watch a replay of a particular delivery, you could take the bat and see if you could do better. The fielding positions and the actual flight of the ball (captured using something like <a href="http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/">Hawk Eye</a>) would be faithful - at least at the start of the shot!</p>

<p>- in a snooker sim, you could pick up a (real) 147 break making frame after the reds have been cleared.</p>

<p>- in an F1 race, you could take over the drive from a real driver. The AI controlling the other drivers could directly simulate an actual race for at least as long as the time as your actions have no influence on any other particular car.</p>

<p>- in a round of golf, you could matchplay an actual game against someone else - or pick up the hole at any point in a championship winning round.</p>

<p>So what? you may say... Sounds a bit dull... just replaying some old game...</p>

<p>Ah yes - but what about if you 'take it from here' during the actual event and play along, maybe split screen style?</p>

<p>Or maybe during the TV replay, your digital ents box offers you a re:play? That is, you get to try the shot, etc. (maybe even 'for real', wii style ;-)</p>

<p>It'd be one way of filling time while the adverts are on!</p>

<p>What this boils down to is interactive sports viewing; or in other words: "I could have made that one - here, I'll show you...".</p>

<p>I don't know know if the "realtime re:play or "I'll take it from here" gaming already exists - maybe it does? (if so, can you drop me a line?)</p>

<p>But it's one of the things I'll be looking out for as we start to write our new short course on game design and interactive media...</p>

<h3 class="title">Disposable Apps</h3>

<p>Watching a Google Tech Talk <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/pipes-a-tech-talk">presentation by the Yahoo team responsible for Pipes</a> (?!;-), which made it clear that Pipes was intended to be used by the 10% of the Web 2.0 <a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=5">creator pyramid</a>, I was struck by the phrase <em>disposable application(s)</em> used to describe apps that are built to be used only once or twice.</p>

<p>(The tiniest bit of digging also turned up a post commenting on the <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/16/disposable-software/">disposable nature of presentations</a>.)</p>

<p>My department - the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk">Dept of ICT</a> - is currently in the middle of Faculty reorganisation that sees us joining with a couple of other departments (<a href="http://systems.open.ac.uk/">Systems</a> and <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tm/">Technology Management</a>, but <em>not</em> <a href="http://www.computing.open.ac.uk/">Computing</a> (don't you just love their URL?) - which <em>is</em> coming into the new Faculty (name tba), but is to be colocated in another part of the campus along with <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a>).</p>

<p>As a consequence of the reorganisation, we have a chance to reinvent ourselves yet again (over the last 10-15 years, the dept. has gone from being an electronics dept, to the Dept of Telematics, to the current Dept of ICT. (Computing always and, I suspect, ever shall be 'Computing', though their offerings <em>have</em> changed over time (e.g. they do less computer science than they used to, I think?).)</p>

<p>The department's reinventions have been pretty successful over time, and our courses remain attractive to employers as well as students. A move into work-based learning (e.g. through <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01G04">Foundation Degrees</a>), certified training with academic credit (e.g. with <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T228">Cisco</a>) and <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">web applications development</a>, backed up by courses addressing hard technology as well as 'softer' social issues, demonstrates a commitment to ongoing innovation in our curriculum.</p>

<p>The question is - where do we see the next 5-10 years going?</p>

<p>Turning back to the idea of 'disposable apps', one area we might consider is developing the idea of ICT <em>users</em> as <em>creators</em> - not only of content, but also of functionality.</p>

<p>As content becomes ubiquitous, the perceived barriers to entry to creating content are lowered.</p>

<p>The explosion of content on the web has many roots of course - content providers making back catalogues available online, broadcasters and the media making a land grab for eyeballs, and so on. As well as Jo Public publishing too, of course, facilitated by one-click web publishing systems (blogs) and online graffiti boards (comments and reviews, etc.;-)</p>

<p>But now we are starting to see one-click application development, too. As well as <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> (designed just for the top 10% remember), I also came across the <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/">Zoho Creator</a> today, one of many database application creators that have appeared over the last few months (<a href="http://dabbledb.com/">dabble db</a> is another one worth trying out).</p>

<p>Content is everywhere, and increasing numbers of people are adding to it as they are tempted to "just give personal web publishing a go".</p>

<p>Data is everywhere too. And it's getting easier and easier to collect. And harder and harder to manage...</p>

<p>...unless we start manipulating it as and when necessary.</p>

<p>Most of us cope with content glut by asking Google to do our hard work for us and find relevant results to our simple search queries.</p>

<p>But how do we cope with data glut? (We don't - we ignore the data...)</p>

<p>I think one thing to aim for is a time when writing data queries is as easy as Googling (did you pick up that Google acquired the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder Trendalyzer</a>?)</p>

<p>And another is finding one-click ways of plugging appropriate data visualisation tools (think <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">IBM's Many Eyes</a>,  and <a href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">then some</a>) into appropriate data sets that have been obtained via search box queries.</p>

<p>Data literacy? I think we should want some of that...</p>

<p>And disposable apps? We're <em>all</em> going to need to be our own developer...</p>

<h3 class="title">So What Exactly Is An OpenLearn Content Remix?</h3>

<p>A couple of things the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a> project tries to sell itself on are the provision of individual and community learning tools, and ability to 'remix' OpenLearn materials.</p>

<p>The community and learning tools include the Compendium sensemaker/concept mapper (it's a download, so there's no web app to link to... ;-), <a href="http://flashmeeting.com">Flashmeeting</a> and the Moodle forums (?!), as well as the MSG (Jabber) instant messaging tool (which is now the <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/developer/"><em>open source</em> MSG lite web messenger</a>).</p>

<p>The <em>remix</em> opportunities are afforded by the open Creative Commons license, the provision of XML download/Moodle module exports (as well as uploads/imports in the same formats) and the aforementioned desktop Compendium application.</p>

<p>Laura Dewis and Stuart Brown (who both blog on <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/">Open Air</a>) have been doing some good stuff in looking at ways of getting Openlearn content into spaces where people may interact with it (and not just using OpenLearn RSS ;-)</p>

<p>However, a problem I have had all along with OpenLearn is 'why bother going there?'</p>

<p>(I'm going to stick my neck out a bit in this post, so it's worth saying that I'm not part of the OpenLearn team, and the opinions expressed herein are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my employers...)</p>

<p>So - first comment - I don't know how many informal learners would choose - or even consider - to do an online course that is  - to all intents and purposes - formally presented?</p>

<p>Maybe they'd go to an evening class for formal/informal study? But I'm not convinced about them doing it online...</p>

<p>A use case I <em>can</em> see is people dipping into course material when they are searching for something vaguely instructional on a particular topic.</p>

<p>For example, I do a lot of queries along the lines of 'xsl for-each tutorial' (tutorial is a keyword I have found to be useful for certain sorts of content, as is 'howto'). I will then look at the particular thing I want to know about and - maybe - look around the edges at what else is there. Or bookmark the site and add it to a <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> profile on a particular topic.</p>

<p>Reuse of courses at a course level is another use case of course (that is, another reason to visit the OpenLearn site and look through a course), but one that applies to a different user group - that of instructor, rather than independent, individual learner.</p>

<p>However, I still don't know what an effective example of an 'openlearn remix' would be  - either at an individual learner <em>or</em> instructor level (though I guess the instructor example would be to take some content and import it into another Moodle environment, then delete the bits you <em>don't</em> want, presumably. I am assuming, of course, that the Moodle export option is an all-or-nothing export of course - but maybe it's friendly than that and lets you choose what you want to take from a particular unit?).</p>

<p>As I understand it, a condition of funding for the OpenLearn team is to get a certain number of hours of content up on the OpenLearn site.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there's enough there <em>now</em> to suggest that the balance of tools, content, community, and sharing/remixing is not quite right.</p>

<p>And my tinkering with XML2whatever toys suggests the schema's not as tight as it could be; or being applied as uniformly as it it might to content across the different subject areas.</p>

<p>Maybe adding more and more content to the site will encourage people to start mixing content outside of OpenLearn - and contributing more back - (dreams of OpenLearn overtaking wikipedia here ;-) but I suspect it won't... Because for OpenLearn, I don't necessarily think that  - given the current architecture of the site - more is necessarily different. And I think different is what's required... (though that said, with every new tool and every minor redesign, things do improve slightly...).</p>

<p>One solution may be for the team to spend a bit of time putting up exemplar reuse cases/mashups <em>whatever</em> the funders say...(?!) <em>if</em>, that is, the team is trusted to do the right thing, rather than what they thought was the right thing way back when while the bid was being pulled together but is now proving - arguably - to be the wrong approach. That is sort of to say - continued addition of content using the same recipe that was used to create the first tranche of content is perhaps not adding as much value as another recipe might?</p>

<p><em>If</em> one of the OpenLearn objectives is to benefit from the same reuse and share, virally marketed hype of sites like YouTube etc., (though closer to OpenLearn are things like scribd.com, slideshare.net, videolectures.net, elgg.net) the content needs to be reusable in usefully shareable chunks.</p>

<p>To take off, the site needs people to stumble across the neat stuff on page one, watch it, share it, look at what's related to it. I've found all sorts of useful presentations on Slideshare, as well as YouTube, by seeing what's related to something I'm <em>already</em> looking at/have already discovered and know to be relevant - socially mediated discovery is really starting to work for me (at times... ;-).</p>

<p>Effective deep linking from the search engines directly into the content is also required - <em>everything</em> needs its own URL, (and to keep the hackers happy, these URLs should conform to some sort of well-structured pattern (I could mention <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009144.html">OpenLearn navigation</a> here...)).</p>

<p>So how easy is it for me to share a video clip on OpenLearn with you (a) if I can find it; and (b) err - is there anything I'd want to share anyway?</p>

<p>(Check out the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">OpenLearn media browser - Ed.</a>! or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010080.html">The Fall and Rise of VideOU</a>)</p>

<p>Okay - so maybe OpenLearn is not like a YouTube and will never get that sort of reach (like Wikipedia... err...).</p>

<p>But the comparison is worth making, I think  - because it forces you to look at the sorts of things that <em>are</em> being successfully shared and remixed. </p>

<p>So how do we get people <em>really</em> engaging with the content in a way that makes them want to repurpose it, even if that only means <em>sharing</em> it...</p>

<p>Maybe we need to unpack the idea of "share"? Sharing is, after all, one of the ways you grow sites virally.</p>

<p>How about this for starters: as a learner, I may share a piece of content in a blog post or via a forum because it is 'a neat explanation of' something; or the explanation gives me a feelgood 'so that's how it works' feeling. (Include in this use case any other reasons you can think of for saying 'check this out folks - a really neat whatevr' (that's a web 2.0 whatever, yes? Technical term...;-)</p>

<p>In addition, it's probably also worth thinking about how people who <em>are</em> sharing resources - or links to particular bits of content - might describe it in a blog post, forum post, email, face to face lecture/lesson/workshop/seminar etc. (This is maybe a bit like the "inside out' model of scenario development put forward by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Long-View-Planning-Uncertain/dp/0385267320?tag=ouseful-21">Peter Schwartz</a> et al.?)</p>

<p>Then, when you have a feel for <em>how</em> people would introduce this stuff into their own performances (where a performance is a lecture/workshop/blog post etc;-) you can start to think 'okay - so how do we make it easy for people to get to <em>that</em> point?' That is, what would they have had to do/experience in order for them to be making use of the content in that way, and how would the content have to be presented to them in order to make it easy for them to <em>use</em> that content?</p>

<p>Another, proactive, way forward that would increase the number of content hours on the OpenLearn site (although not in the sense the project has defined those hours, I suspect...) would be to start committing resource to producing example remixes.</p>

<p>The easiest remix is not really a remix at all, and barely counts as a reuse, though it is a <em>republish</em> or re<em>present</em> - just take a direct copy of someone else's content and make it your own property/publish it on your own site, in your own content area etc.; which is not that interesting... but at least it shows someone else cares enough to take a copy. And it's <em>another</em> place for eyeballs to see that content.</p>

<p>The next but several easiest remix (;-) is to take a direct copy of someone else's remix <em>pattern</em> and then change a  couple of bits contained within that pattern; by a pattern, I mean something like: a dash of OpenLearn content, a drizzle of a youTube movie and a splash or two of BBC news item per page. Retain the pattern (or maybe 'remix template'?), change the content.</p>

<p>One of the things I'm exploring with <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle/stringleProfileSelect.php">Stringle</a> are patterns - or arrangements  - of content that maybe appropriate for OU/BBC automated remixes. So for example, the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On Stringle demo</a> has a particular (templated) navigation pattern:</p>

<p><img alt="o2stringlePattern.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/o2stringlePattern.png" width="214" height="176" border="0" /></p>

<p>Okay - this post has gone on way too long - I'll end it with some news: the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007">OpenLearn Conference</a> in October will have a keynote from <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seeley Brown</a>; read the announcement <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/news/news-full.php?id=10809">here</a>. Maybe I will have to go after all...;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">The Future of Music</h3>

<p>Old news now in the blogosphere - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6516189.stm">EMI lets go of DRM on iTunes</a> (a good summary - and links to the press releases - <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/emi_music_drm_free.php">here</a>) - but a useful hook for this post - who's interested in MP3 downloads when you can recompile the source?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nin.com/current/">NIN</a> (that's Nine Inch Nails) look set to release <em>all</em> the tracks on their forthcoming album as <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> 'source' files; </p>

<p><img alt="ninRemix.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ninRemix.png" width="618" height="237" border="0" /></p>

<p>NIN have actually been doing this with <a href="http://www.nin.com/downloads/index.html">one-off tracks</a> for a couple of years, and encouraging remixers to upload their mixes as part of a remix competition. In addition to Garageband files, releases have also been made for other audio mixing software.</p>

<p>A slightly different approach is taken by <a href="http://www.u-myx.com/">U-Myx</a> who require users to use the U-Myx software - and pay for the downloads.</p>

<p>But for a similar result - the user gets to play... ;-)</p>

<p>This approach is something I have dreamed of over the last 15 years as wouldn't-it-be-good-if idles, and anticipated eagerly more recently. My expectation over the last 5 years or so was that CD singles/albums would start to include remix applications/software studios on that medium - but I've been tracking it as a download reality on and off for the last 6 months or so (though it's been happening for longer).</p>

<p>That said - my expectation of getting the 'src' on the CD was predicated on the supply of the remix application on the CD too, rather than it being pre-installed on the users' computer.</p>

<p>The next thing I'm looking out for is a 'live by machine' gig, where a club franchise has real hardware/synths being played <em>at a distance</em> by the band, who are maybe in another venue owned by that club chain?</p>

<p>For this, you have to imagine banks of synths receiving (MIDI) control signals over the net from the <em>real</em> musicians playing live elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is not so much <a href="http://www.ninjam.com/index.php">online jamming</a> (or here: <a href="http://www.ejamming.com/">eJamming</a>) - where you mix realtime audio feeds from other musicians on the web with your own efforts - as real time creation of the music from audio generators...</p>

<p>.. a bit like the way audio in games works today, and how <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/news/view.php?id=2419">MIDI created audio in computer games</a> is going.</p>

<p>And the next step after that?</p>

<p>Well, you won't be downloading MP3. Instead I'm looking forward to a time when we'll be downloading a Garageband-like mix to our Garageband-like stereos - its audio card will generate sounds using onboard synths and samplers and do a real time audio mix for you.</p>

<p>So if you like to tinker with a graphic equaliser on your current stereo, the Garageband-like remix player is gonna be a whole load of fun... ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Viewing Powerpoint on the Web</h3>

<p>Living as a I do now a) on a Mac, and b) usually online, I get fed up when people send me MS Office docs that I don't necessarily have viewers for or links to docs that I have to download and open...</p>

<p>...because being an untidy sort, my desktop and download areas - like my mailbox - are frequently cluttered with docs that I've downloaded so that I could use a desktop app to open and view them...</p>

<p>So henceforth I've giving up a little bit more of my life to an online solution: <a href="http://writer.zoho.com/public/help/zohoquickread/fullpage">Zoho Quickread</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="zohoOpen.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/zohoOpen.png" width="326" height="235" border="0" /></p>

<p>This browser plugin lets you open most office docs that are linked to from a public web page in the appropriate (online) Zoho app. No account necessary - I think?</p>

<p>Google do something similar, of course, with .doc docs in GMail, but  Zoho is the more complete solution... at the moment...</p>

<p>[UPDATE 12/7/07 - As well as opening .doc and .xls attachments in GMail, GMail now <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/about_whatsnew.html">also opens powerpoint .ppt presentation files</a>, a precursor announcement to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/17/googles-office-suite-complete-google-powerpoint-confirmed/">imminent  gPresenter app</a>, I suspect..?]</p>

<p>There are bound to be issues, of course - like Zoho only being able to display <em>public</em> files (and not ones that require authentication to view them); and maybe some copyright issues - I'm not sure if Zoho maintain a copy of files you view, for example (or whether you can import them directly into your Zoho account).</p>

<p>In fact - the Zoho toolbar doesn't really solve the problem of opening emailed document attachments at all (whereas the Google solution does)...</p>

<p>...but it's a start...and it means I'll probably end up viewing more online presentations (that aren't <a href="http://slideshare.net">slideshared</a>) than I currently do...</p>

<p>PS hmm - I wonder - Zoho have pretty effective APIs for all their apps; and Yahoo just opened up their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/mail/">Yahoo mail API</a>... I wonder???</p>

<h3 class="title">Just In Case...</h3>

<p>Unlikely - but anyway... did anyone out there happen to record the hour long "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/listings/programme.shtml?filename=20070330/20070330_2100_4544_12424_60&service_id=4544">Hawkwind: Do Not Panic</a>" documentary that aired on BBC Four at 9pm on March 30th?</p>

<p>If so, I'd be really grateful if you could lend me a DVD or video copy... ;-)</p>

<p>UPDATE <em>what the **** was I talking about - DVD copy....</em>. <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/preview/?s=SOZM7558XA">See the program</a>, courtesy of YouTube, via a show on my Splashcast <em>Blast from the Past</em> music channel: </p>

<p>I've also popped a show on the channel featuring a (bootlegged?) video of a 1984 Hawkwind gig...</p>
