<p>A propos nothing, I've noticed over the last few weeks and months an increasing number of tools that support the micro-annoation of a wide range of electronic resources.</p>

<p>Whilst I'm not going to blog - just yet - about how we might make use of many of these technologies, I thought it might be worth putting up a few signposts to a tiny sample of them:</p>

<ul><li>services that allow you to <em>"micro-annotate" webpages</em> (such as <a href="http://www.activeweave.com/">Stickis</a>, <ahref="http://kaboodle.com/">Kaboodle</a> and <a href="http://www.shadows.com/">Shadows</a>);</li>
<li><em>social bookmarking</em> sites in general that support user comments/annoatation (for example, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> or <a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>);</li>
<li><em>photo/image annotation</em>, such as in <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> and the scary <a href="http://www.riya.com/">Riya</a>;</li>
<li>there's even <em>audio annotation</em> from <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/10/on_the_bbc_annotatable_audio_project.shtml">BBC Annotatable Audio project</a>;</li>
<li>and of course, tagging the planet, such as these recently unveiled sites: <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/">Panoramio</a> or <a href="http://www.yourhistoryhere.com/">Your History Here</a> (there's just too many of these Google maps sites - keep an eye on <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google Maps Mania</a> if you want regular updates...One thing they do remind me of is a living Domesday book. The BBC did a multimedia one in <a href="http://www.domesday1986.com/">1986</a> - perhaps now is time to start a rolling Domesday book?)

<p>I've commented in several previous posts about a few of the ways that course news feeds can be viewed in an everday and pain-free way (e.g. <a title="OUseful Info: Easy-to-use Course RSS Feeds?" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004111.html">here</a>  and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004181.html">here</a>),  and here's another - via a <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">personalised Google homepage</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="googleIgTSCPNews.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleIgTSCPNews.JPG" width="493" height="442" border="0" /></p>

<p>There's a limited amount of customisation of the feed allowed, specifically - you can change how many headlines are displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="googleIgPrefs.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleIgPrefs.JPG" width="441" height="227" border="0" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>If you want to see how easy it is to set this up, check out this (silent) <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googlePersonalRSS.wmv">screencast</a> (Windows only? or at least, you'll need a wmv viewer (sorry - experimenting with what produces the smallest files...)).</p>

<p>One of the downsides is that you'll need to register with Google, and use the personalised homepage http://www.google.com/ig (which I think is the default on the Google toolbar? It seems to work that way in my setup, but perhaps that's just because a Google cookie shows I'm usually logged in to <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> (or should that be <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/googlemail.html">Googlemail</a> here in the UK?;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost...</h3>

Although an XML feed from ROUTES has been available for some time (and as Ive mentioned in various posts before), I'm not sure how widely it's being used to actually feed ROUTES information into other pages. Some course eDesktop pages...
<!--
<p>Although an <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml.php?course=Technology">XML feed from ROUTES</a> has been available for some time (and as Ive mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=xml+routes">various posts</a> before), I'm not sure how widely it's being used to actually feed ROUTES information into other pages. Some course eDesktop pages do republish ROUTES information, and it's quite possible that this is captured from the ROUTES feed in some way (e.g. when publishing a site from its XML template), but a quick inspection of the ROUTES site itself suggests that the ROUTES search pages do not use the XML feed to display the results?</p>

<p>Why should they, though? Well, as ever, when I get a glimpse of how a Javascript trick works, I think it should be applied everywhere!;-) And the latest thing I've been tinkering with is xmlhttprequest... Now I know this has been around for a long time, but I've only recently just started to play with it, spurred on in part by it's 'rebranding' earlier this year as <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a> (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).</p>

<p>One of the main attractions of xmlhttprequest is that it can be used to modify content within a page with new content obtained from a server, without having to refresh the page. This generally makes for a far smoother user interaction, and also means that you cut down on exposing the user to messy URLs in the browser address line.</p>

<p>To give a quick example, here's a link to a ROUTES-XML search on the keyword <em>Technology</em>. The file I'm calling is actually a capture of a ROUTES-XML response - the xmlhttprequest security policy has been defined to prevent requests being made from one domain to another, so I can't actually make a request to the ROUTES-XML service itself.</p>

<p>Once you click on the link in the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/ajaxROUTESxmlDemo1.html" target="_blank">test page</a>, an xmlhttprequest is made to a test page, which returns the search response as an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/routes_xml.xml">XML document</a>. A Javascript function then parses this result, modifies the structure of the current page, and displays the result <em>without having to reload the page</em>.</p>

<p>Now that's all well and good, but you'll notice a few <em>issues</em> perhaps. In the first instance, the URL displayed in the list of results (now shown above, if you clicked on the link) are broken. What seems to be happening is that when I create an anchor link, it is being set relative to the local directory. Now I'm not sure if this is down to me <s>(probably!) or an enforced security policy - as I'm doodling this offline, I can;t check just at the mo.</s> [yes, it was my problem, of course...the query returns a URL filled with ASCII character codes, so the URL isn't recognised as a URL*... An alternative approach I should have noticed would have been to parse the resource ID field, and then append the ID number to a URL stub...]</p>

<p>Anyway, it does bring at least one thing to my attention, which is that the ROUTES-XML feed is really messy... How much cleaner would it be if the ROUTES-XML links could:</p>

<p>a) all be made relative to a common root domain (http://routes.open.ac.uk, for example), and</p>

<p>b) cleaned up path-wise by using a redirect (e.g. redirecting from <em>ixbin%2Fhixclient.exe%3F_IXDB_%3Droutes%26_IXSPFX_%3Dg%26submit-button%3Dsummary%26%2524%2Bwith%2Bres_id%2Bis%2Bres<strong>nnnn</strong></em> to <em>routesID%2B<strong>nnnn</strong></em></p>

<p>* Here's the js fix, which should be applied to the URL:<br />
<tt>function unASCIIChars( s )<br />
{<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3A/g, ':' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%2F/g, '/' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3F/g, '?' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3D/g, '=' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%26/g, '&' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%2B/g, '+' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%25/g, '%' ); <br />
 &nbsp;return s;<br />
}<br />
</tt></p>

<h3 class="title">Paced Content Delivery via RSS</h3>

I just stumbled across this announcement (Surfarama » RSS for serialized content) about delivering an e-book to readers, a few pages a day, via RSS: "[It]doesn’t matter when you first subscribe, this feed will deliver the book to your feed...
<!--
<p>I just stumbled across this announcement (<a title="Surfarama » RSS for serialized content" href="http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242">Surfarama » RSS for serialized content</a>) about delivering an e-book to readers, a few pages a day, via RSS:</p>

<p><em>"[It]doesn’t matter when you first subscribe, this feed will deliver the book to your feed reader in the right order, a couple of chapters a day, over the next month."</em></p>

<p>The idea has apparently surfaced a few times in the past (such as <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I think I like this, and I think I like it a lot. The mechansim provides one way of delivering paced content to users of elearning materials.</p>

<p>Rather than having to log on to an elearning providers site, the mechanism allows course content to be pushed to the student a bit a time, whioch might be attractive to informal learners.</p>

<p>The content arrives in your personal reader, so if the chunks are small enough, then a reader might well be able to work through the chunk there and then.</p>

<p>If a user is allowed to tune the delivery times (i.e. the times at which their RSS reader picks up the content) then they could ensure that content is delivered at an appropriate time.</p>

<p>Say you have a slow Tuesday afternoon most weeks? Then schedule a content pickup for lunchtime Tuesday. The content won't be languishing in your RSS reader marked as unread for days as you wait for your study day to come around. Instead, the content arrives at a time you said you'd be ready for it. </p>

<p>The two things I like about this idea, then, are:</p>

<ol><li>Getting learning content pushed to a user's personal space, as a result of the user subscribing to it, as opposed to publishing it to a 'private' VLE the student must log in to and only uses for their learning activities. This personal space idea is an important one, I think, as it embeds the learning material/content in channel's thaty users use to receive content on a daily basis. That is, we are embedding learning in everyday activity (which may or may not be effective practise? But is is <em>one way</em> of rethinking lifelong learning, in the sense of integrating learning into everyday activities.</li>
<li>Allowing users to schedule delivery/pickup of content for times when they are likely to be able to consume it*.</li></ol>

<p>*This reminds me of another thread that keeps appearing, about the downside of subscription and the overload that's now facing more and more of us as we subscribe to more and more feeds. Just as my mailbox has hundreds of emails in various states (read, unread, replied to, must reply to, etc. etc.), now my RSS feeds are starting to back up with unread, and increasingly ignored posts. The problem is of too much info.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps one way round this is for me to:</p>

<p>a) start filtering feeds a bit more;<br />
<em>and</em></p>

<p>b) start scheduling different feeds for pickup on different days, say. So I could have a CSS day, and a Web 2.0 day...?! This introduces a lag, sure, but it does block out in an architectural way the days on which particular things I'm subscribed to feed me new content. (I guess it's also a way of using technology to help me out with my lack of discipline!)</p>

<p><br />
And finally, a PS - in case you haven't heard, the <em>flock</em> "social browser" is now available as a <a href="http://www.flock.com/developer">developer\download</a>...<br />
</p>

<h3 class="title">Keeping Course Homepages Current With 'Related News' Feeds</h3>

<p>A quick note on a minor breakthrough a couple of weeks ago: the T184 course homepage now consumes a feed from one of mt del.iocio.us tags, which allows me to get robotics related news items onto the course homepage without having to negotiate any OU systems.</p>

<p>The Robot News feed actually uses a <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/feeds/js/">deli.cio.us linkroll</a> Javascript include to pull in a javascript->html rendering of my last 3 delicious bookmarks tagged as 'T184 news'. This means I can now add links to robot related news stories (in the case of T184) very easily indeed.</p>

<p><img alt="T184tagNews.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/T184tagNews.jpg" width="355" height="717" border="0" /></p>

<p>Why bother? Well, it adds an element of currency that I'd like to think might contribute to our students' experience of the course in several possible ways, such as:</p>

<p>- by providing content that's bang upto date, and might potentiall seed conference discussions;</p>

<p>- by adding a bit of colour and a wider context to the course material, especially for students who don't in to the conferences.</p>

<p>You might also notice in the above screenshot a glimpse of some of 'pacing guidance' that students get on the home page in the form of <strong>Do</strong> and <strong>Read</strong> instructions that guide students to the areas of study for the current week.</p>

<p>It struck me that if we also published keywords/tags for the current week, then over time - if any of our students get into social bookmarking and tagging - this might be one way of providing a way in to student identified relevant items.</p>

<p>Ideally, we'd offer something like a  Connotea or del.icio.us service to all our students, and encourage them to use it for the purposes of saving and tagging links to resources relevant to their courses.</p>

<p>On an issue related to this, I've been tagging links to resources identified by T184 students in the July, 2005, cohort provided as part of an answer to one of their ECA (end-of-course assessment) questions:</p>

<p><em>Imagine that you work for a technology research and consultancy company that is regularly approached to produce reports on advances in modern technology. You have been asked by a magazine publisher to write some short commentaries on the following potential robot technologies.</p>

<p>Your answers should consist of a short commentary including any major issues that are likely to arise (for example, safety or public acceptance) and how you think the public might react to them. Include in each answer at least two references, either to the course materials or to websites that you have found.</em></p>

<p>The topics to be addressed, and the links that I remembered to bookmark, were <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/eca05G+t184+assistive">assistive robotics</a>, and <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/eca05G+t184+rights">robot rights</a>.</p>

<p>This was an interesting exercise for me, though I'm still trying to articulate why I think it's useful... I'm also wondering how I can get students to bookmark and tag the links themselves as part of the assessment process (and what the attendant learning objective/outcome would be, unless it was just requested as part of the assessment administrivia...)</p>

<h3 class="title">Toolbars as Mindgrab?</h3>

The recent announcement that Google will be making downloads of Sun's OpenOffice suite in exchange for a Google toolbar browser download with every Java SDK was picked up nicely by this post from John Battelle: John Battelle's Searchblog: Google-Sun -...
<!--
<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4310474.stm">recent announcement</a> that Google will be making downloads of Sun's OpenOffice suite in exchange for a Google toolbar browser download with every Java SDK was picked up nicely by this post from John Battelle: <a title="John Battelle's Searchblog: Google-Sun - The Toolbar, Ay, There's the Rub" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001914.php">John Battelle's Searchblog: Google-Sun - The Toolbar, Ay, There's the Rub</a>.</p>

<p>And the rub is?</p>

<p><em>"In other words, Google really, really wants more Toolbar distribution."</em></p>

<p>If users continue to spend more and more time in their browser, it's easy to see that making a grab for a permament piece of browser real estate is a  sensible thing to do... </p>

<p>So why's that interesting for  the OU? Well, what of there was an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=toolbar">OU toolbar</a>? For current students it would combine at least Library and course resources (with the odd link to course sales web pages, of course), for non-students tools to access open content learning materials, perhaps, as well as 'public' OU sites.</p>

<p>Why? First off (for current students) - time-saving and added value. For prospective students, easier access to open content learning resources (and perhaps an open content OU VLE?)</p>

<p>Far off - search and Google are now, to many people, synonymous. If we want lifelong, web based learning and the OU to have a similar realtionship in people's minds, we need presence - and the toolbar is a good way - at the moment -  to provide it...</p>
