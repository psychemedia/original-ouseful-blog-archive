<h3 class="title">OpenLearn 2007 Keynote: John Seely Brown</h3>

<p>[UPDATE: there's an article that covers most of the ground mentioned in this talk here: <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Review/MindsonFireOpenEducationt/45823?time=1201597685">Educase review: Minds on Fire: Open Education, the Long Tail, and Learning 2.0</a>]</p>

<p>[I wasn't going to post these notes, as notes, but I think it's interesting to compare my notes with those of a couple of others who blogged the same talk...  <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/john-seely-brown-patrick-reporting/">John Seely Brown - Patrick reporting</a>, <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/johnseelybrownjpg/">OpenLearn Keynote Address by John Seely Brown</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ac/rMEc/~3/177117335/">Open Learning Broadly Construed</a> and <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/john-seely-brown-keynote-speech/">John Seely Brown Keynote Speech</a> (hmm - i wonder what would happend if i passed each of these posts through the same content analysis tool... would the posts give rise to the same keywords? ;-) A main difference, I think, is that my post: 1) is built up from keywords and phrases, with occasional personal comments, rather than a personal prose commentary of the presentation (I tend to do that <em>post hoc</em>, writing up talk notes on the evening of, or days following, the event); 2) my post includes links, and 3) I found and skimmed those links whilst the presentation was on (partial attention!), complementing the presentation with the Google font of knowledge...;-)]<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a> - Open Learning Broadly Construed</p>

<p>Coals to Newcastle, given OU status in open and distance education.</p>

<p>Routes to sustainability<br />
Leveraging learning that always happens... e.g. immersive language learning</p>

<p>"Cartesian view of learning" - transfer of knowledge, "I teach, you learn" delivery models, naturally fosters subject disciplines..</p>

<p>cf. the social view of learning,  "we participate therefore we are", <em>understanding</em> (rather than knowledge) is socially constructed.</p>

<p>"We learn in and through our interaction with others and the world."</p>

<p>Nothing beats collaborative study groups - best indicator of ??? is the ability to join and participate in a collaborative study group.</p>

<p>This works in the distributed world (e.g. via IM) as well as face-to-face.</p>

<p>"The social life of learning".</p>

<p>Students are already embedded in a social network (from home, school etc.) when they arrive at university, and this forms one special sort of study group...</p>

<p>The best way to learn something is to teach something - study groups again....</p>

<p>Learning as supported through participatory architectures...</p>

<p>Come to understand knowledge through conversations with others.</p>

<p>The architecture studio - the <a href="http://www.architexturez.net/+/subject-listing/000013.shtml">atelier form of learning</a>, a powerful social learning envt<br />
 - learning as enculturation into a practice;<br />
 - work in progress is made public;<br />
-&gt; peripheral participation layer.</p>

<p>Beyond textbook learning, from learning-about, to learning-to-be.</p>

<p>**Can we reverse the flow - turn passionate learning-to-be into learning about.. "Unleashing productive enquiry"</p>

<p>Technology enabled active learning <a href="http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/teal_tour.htm">TEAL</a><br />
Move MIT electo/mag course to a studio based model. "Sage on the stage" doesn't work...</p>

<p>Faulkes telescope</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/dweb.shtml">Decameron web</a>, (<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ach_allc2001/papers/roz/index.html">SGML backbone</a>) - a new forum for partipatory scholarship.</p>

<p>'Modern' kids from the global world, mobile phones and web connectivity.</p>

<p>Tinkering as a  learning platform - it's death and rebirth as remix, mashups.</p>

<p>tinkering stop - devices became cognitively impenetrable; then tinkering returned... open source, game mods, media remix<br />
Tinkering today is gender neutral [??!?!?!always was?? - tinkering in kitchen and home, clothingg etc actively pursued by women..]</p>

<p>Polyani - tacit knowledge - <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm">http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm</a></p>

<p>Life in the digital age - a culture of participation: tinkering, building, remixing, sharing. Creating meaning - I produce and others build on.</p>

<p>Ying and yang of production and consumption</p>

<p>Open source as a participatory learning platform; distributed, situated learning. Process of enculturation - pick up sensibilities and practices of a pre-existing, working community.</p>

<p>Remix and mashup - creative tinkering and the play of imagination; fan fiction [but also think play - playing out TV scenes];</p>

<p>Filling in backstory -creative reading.</p>

<p>[??how could this tie in with <a href="http://www.wwcd.org/action/Boal.html">Theatre of the Oppressed/Forum Theatre</a>]</p>

<p>The Brewing Sotrm of opportunity - OER, eScience, eHumanities, web 2.0 -&gt; Open Participatory Learning Ecosystem (with feedback loops galore)</p>

<p>What are the ways of closing the loop and fostering intertwining</p>

<p>Fundamental trend - from scarcity to abundance<br />
Manufacturing economy  - consumer society - creator economy (culture of co-creation and participation)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-Tail-Endless-Creating-Unlimited/dp/1844138518?tag=ouseful-21">Long Tail</a></p>

<p>Long Tail in Learning... supporting the rise of an ecology of learning/doing niches</p>

<p>Active blending - yin-yang odf learning on the one hand and research/doing/making on the other.</p>

<p>From stock (supply push), to flow (demand pull)<br />
From a stable world to a rapidly changing world [but what is it that's changing?]</p>

<p>Learning 2.0 - learning on demand.</p>

<p>When recreation becomes re-creation/remix and productive enquiry: a culture of learning, participatory life long learning and the ultimate sustainability model... [BUT - I prefer daily learning; just as a social app should have a personal payoff, lifelong learning needs appropriate daily practice]<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn2007" rel="tag">openlearn2007</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
