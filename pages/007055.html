<h3 class="title">OU Netvibes Competition...?</h3>

<p>I recently posted about some <a href="./007002.html">OU Netvibes Modules</a> which in part resulted from a few email discussions I'd been having about Netvibes with other folks here in the OU. Those conversations in turn arose - in part again - from chatting about the recent PLE gigs I've been to.</p>
<p>It seems like Martin Weller (who has just come out as a blogger at <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/">Ed Techie</a>) has also been thinking that <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/05/netvibes.html">Netvibes may be a useful as a demonstrator</a>, (even though it looks as if we are committed to <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/My_Moodle">MyMoodle</a> as a student homepage in the new VLE).</p>

<p>So out of all of this, I was wondering, would it be worth getting a few people together, doing a Netvibes briefing (if required) and then having a bit of a play to see where we can push it? Holding the session over the course of an afternoon, with a developer/hacker or two around to on the spot ad hoc prototype Netvibes modules if necessary, could be very fruitful I think. </p>

<p>The session would ideally have a set of required outcomes:</p>

<p>a) a set of shareable Netvibes tabs capable of acting as:</p>

<ul><li>a demo personal/intranet tab for OU staff;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course (in each faculty?);</li>
<li>a demo tab for CT members of a course in production;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course in presentation;</li>
<li>a demo student homepage tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL personal tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL on a course in presentation tab;</li>
<li>a demo Myopenlibrary tab</li></ul>

<p>b) identification of current services that do not have feeds; it would also be sensible to scope out what information they should expose in that way;</p>

<p>c) identification of feeds from services that do not yet exist but that would be really neat to have ;-)</p>

<p>If time allowed, it would also be useful to mock up feeds inspired by items identified under b and c with static files, (or generate the feed for b by scraping) so they could be demonstrated in the demo tabs.</p>

<p>Armed with the demos and a shopping list of required feeds, we'd have a better understanding of the PLE nature of Netvibes, a set of tabs that could in principle be used to support OU activity, a better idea of the ways in which feeds can be used to drive content into Moodle and a clearer understanding of what other service related feeds might be beneficial were they available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could launch a mini-internal competition, in which individuals would be free to post one or more shareable demo tabs, as I did in the post mentioned right at the start...</p>

<p>If anyone's interested in this competition, I'm sure I could find a prize or two somewhere (a packet of Polos, perhaps...;-)</p>
