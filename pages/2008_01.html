<p> Some time ago, I put together a custom search engine - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">How do I?</a> - that provides a meta-search over instructional video sites (read the background here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010608.html">"How Do I..."  - Instructional Video Search</a>).</p>

<p>It's getting some traffic every day, which is encouraging, and I'm sort of maintaining it, in the sense of adding new sites as and when I come across them. The two most recent additions are TeacherTube and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/ivideosongs-teaches-you-how-to-be-a-real-guitar-hero/">iVideoSongs</a> (video tutorials on how to play the guitar, etc.)</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, I also started looking at a more elaborate custom search engine, based on finding recipes and video cookery demos. I've popped it up at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/howdoicook">How Do I Cook?</a> (though I think I prefer the original name I gave it - "What's Cooking?")</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2231905455/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2034/2231905455_06b5004942.jpg" alt="2008-01-31_1020" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="250" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The cookery search site is far more elaborate in terms of search refinements - I demoed ethnic food types, vegetarian cookerty, TV chefs, and so on, to try and get a feel for the info architecture:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2231906787/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2018/2231906787_dd5cff9c77.jpg" alt="2008-01-31_1021" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="315" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>One thing it would be nice to be able do would be to support hierarchical, or nested, search refinments - for example, a single TV chef refinement that the offers further refinements corresponding to different chefs. I could do a separate search engine for each one, I suppose, but that approach feels a bit clunky.</p>

<p>In a similar way, I need to think about how I can best 'integrate' the general "How Do I?" search engine and the "What's Cooking/How Do I Cook?" CSE. The correlate here is Google general search versus things like image search and Google Scholar.</p>

<p>As I see it, there are two major issues. Firstly, finding a design that allows you to go from one search engine to another. Secondly, embedding results from one search engine in the results listing of another - such as the way Google universal search embeds images, Youtube movies and maps in the main search results page.</p>

<p>In an OU context, the reason <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> I'm playing with these ideas is because I think each course should have it's own, embedded CSE that searches over sites relevant to the course...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cse" rel="tag">cse</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20custom%20search" rel="tag"> custom search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20howdoi" rel="tag"> howdoi</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20how%20do%20i" rel="tag"> how do i</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20cookery" rel="tag"> cookery</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20howto" rel="tag"> howto</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p> Traipsing through a load of long forgotten and lost links that I don't think I blogged about before (which means I can't find them by searching Ouseful.info ;-), here are a couple of elearning design doodles that I maybe need to look at again someday...</p>

<p>Firstly, a set of examples showing different ways of <a href="http://phoenixweb.open.ac.uk/%7ETony_Hirst/tu120animationDemo/">embedding a series of screenshots in a web page</a>.  The case in point was an demonstration of the google suggest feature, where live suggestions/search phrase recommendations appear in a drop down list form the google search box.</p>

<p>For example, here's the animated gif version:</p>

<p><a href="http://phoenixweb.open.ac.uk/%7ETony_Hirst/tu120animationDemo/"><img src="http://phoenixweb.open.ac.uk/%7ETony_Hirst/tu120animationDemo/gSuggest.gif" alt="Google suggest animation: car valeting" style="border: 0pt none ;" /></a></p>

<p>The other examples include a screencast, a slideshow, and an embedded (i.e. interactive) iframe (so the students could try out the feature themselves). I didn't do a custom embedded demo, though that would be trivial with the frameworks around now.</p>

<p>The second thing I need to link to - and I'd completely forgotten about this - is a short (silent) screencast showing some of the crazy things you can do in a Google search box. I think I did this as a trailer for an "In Search of Google" partial attention workshop (in which I provide a commentary as we ramble around the links on this <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/106431">In Search of Google H2O playlist</a>!), or maybe it was for <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120</a>?;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, if you have a five minutes to spare, you can watch it here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120playground/googleSearchBox/">"I didn't know you could do that in a Google search box!" screencast</a>.</p>

<p>PS the Google results page has moved on a bit since that movie was recorded. For example, the library search result returns an embedd Google local search map, now...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/screencast" rel="tag">screencast</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/animation" rel="tag">animation</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Google Generation JISC Report</h3>

<!--
<p>Although I try not to go in for "you've seen it elsewhere, but anyway" posts, I can't not mention the recently released <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/resourcediscovery/googlegen.aspx">Google Generation report</a>, which tries to get a handle on the information skills that the post-1993 generation have acquired.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how they've acquired this skills, though? From tinkering, presumably? I'm not sure the kids are doing much in the way of search skills development in school, and I suspect that many librarians would rather try to get people to use their arcane systems rather than help people use Google better, at least in the first instance...<br />
<blockquote>the key point is that information skills have to be developed during formative school years [slide 24]</blockquote>It's a bit like the language librarian refusing to let you read foreign classics in anything other than the original language: "Not only can't we read a recently translated novel with a sense of how the foreign work draws on its native traditions, but uneven translation patterns can all too easily harden into misleading cultural stereotypes." <a href="http://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article.php?lab=HowTo">Words without Borders: How to read a translation</a>.</p>

<p>That is: "Not only can't we do a search in Google with a sense of how an original article fits into peer-reviewed academic discourse, but Google's index anything policy can all too easily beguile the reader into succumbing to misplaced authority."</p>

<p>But for most people, the original language is inaccessible. I'd probably even have trouble reading Asterix in the original French... So I read the English version...</p>

<p>So  - "what do we know about young people's information behaviour?" (slide 13 of the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/reppres/gg_final_keynote_11012008.pdf">Google Generation Final Keynote presentation</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2225091341/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2271/2225091341_c35de30c8c.jpg" alt="2008-01-28_1026" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="356" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Seeing this, my first thought was: "so how old are the people teaching the upcoming generation their information skills?" Which prompted the language librarian thought...</p>

<p>Secondary school science doesn't teach string theory (I don't think...?!). It may not even cover the equations relating to simple harmonic motion any may (too much calculus). And not everyone studies physics at school anyway... Kids in school won't be covering Proquest (I suspect...). But what are they doing?<br />
<blockquote>Students usually approach their research without regard to the library's structure or the way that library segments different  resources into different areas of its web site.  Library web sites often reflect an organizational view of the library ... they do not  do a particularly good job of aggregating content on a particular subject area.<br />
...<br />
Children (especially) tend to make very narrow relevance judgements by considering the presence or absence of words exactly describing the search topic: as a result they miss many relevant documents and end up repeating searches.</blockquote>If you haven't done so already, read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Miscellaneous-Power-Digital-Disorder/dp/0805080430/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=ouseful-21">Everything is Miscellaneous</a>, or at least <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2159021324062223592">listen to a talk about it</a>.</p>

<p><embed style="width: 400px; height: 326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=2159021324062223592&amp;hl=en-GB" flashvars=""> </p>

<p>As to looking for keywords users searched with - I suspect this is in part down to the application of a naive but understandable relevancy heuristic (so some skill is being applied, then...;-) <br />
<blockquote>... they exhibit a strong preference for expressing themselves in natural language rather than analysing which key words might be more effective</blockquote><br />
As search interfaces get better, the user-perception of appropriateness and relevancy will change. For example, I suspect we'll go through a phase of ubiquitous clustering interfaces (see <a href-="" http:="" clusty.com="">Clusty</a> for an example, though all the search engines are experimenting with similar things) and this will help give the user confidence that returned results are relevant even if the search terms aren't prominent...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2225912298/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/2225912298_7e3703491a.jpg" alt="2008-01-28_1051" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="482" width="379" /></a></p>

<p>One of the problems of doing keyword searching well is knowing waht the keywords are. Clustering can help in this respect - a poorly phrased natural language search can be used to discover clusters which might help identify more appropriate keywords. The identified clusters may thus be able to help educate, and guide, the user.<br />
<blockquote>... the future is now, not ten years away...</blockquote>Google is innovating all the time - as are it's competitors; and Amazon too ("'books' are still the primary library brand association for this group, despite massive investment in digital resources, of which students are largely unfamiliar"). So how's your OPAC and federated search programme coming along?</p>

<p>PS In the 'authority' stakes, librarians tend to claim the high ground insofar as information provision grows. Compare this to the kids' behaviour:<br />
<blockquote>One area of current interest, and, indeed, concern, is the way young people evaluate - or rather fail to evaluate - information from electronic sources. [slide 23]</blockquote>Hmm - so looking at <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7177/full/451397a.html">Nature Commentary: A Tale of Two Citations</a>, are the librarians complicit in what I guess amounts to something tantamout to fraud(?!), are they in favour of plagiarism, or are their quality filters broken? I suspect many kids can pick up that a blog is a splog (err, that's spam blog ;-). So how come  the library can't pick up on a spam journal articles and put filters in place to "protect us" from them?;-)</p>

<p>PPS If you're looking for an info skills course for 6th Formers, the OU <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a> information skills course is available via the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/yass/">Young Applicants in Schools Scheme (YASS)</a></p>

<p><br />
PPPS Another reason why formal publishing often sucks, actually, compared to link fuelled blog posts: <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/02/08/mythbusting-the-google-generation-report/">Mythbusting the ‘Google generation’ report  </a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/library2.0" rel="tag">library2.0</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20elibrary" rel="tag"> elibrary</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20JISC" rel="tag"> JISC</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20Google%20Generation" rel="tag"> Google Generation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20CIBER" rel="tag"> CIBER</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Displaying Google Calendar Events on a Map</h3>

<p>If you use Google Calendar, you'll probably know that you can add a location for every calendar event; you may even know that you can then click through to that location on a Google map (see the <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">map</span> link?):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2221439456/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2221439456_9d8ef46c59.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_1939" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="167" width="401" /></a></p>

<p>Last night, I was having a little tinker putting together a calendar of the public consultation events regarding the Isle of Wight council proposals for the future of school education on the Island. Using a Google Calendar makes it easy to embed the calendar on an any web page, which means the calendar becomes a reusable resource for other people, if they want to display such a calendar.</p>

<p>From the Calendar settings:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2220656805/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2284/2220656805_5a074683b5.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_1945" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="191" width="287" /></a></p>

<p>you can grab some embed code for the calendar:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2220664195/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2163/2220664195_8ef66c7180.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_1948" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="121" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>which can then be pasted in your own web pages (feed readers, click thru to see the embedding on the original page...):</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=540&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=u0aq4g3cjf6g6nnesa8mv0l77g%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%235229A3&amp;ctz=Europe%2FLondon" style="border-width: 0pt;" frameborder="0" height="550" scrolling="no" width="300"></iframe></p>

<p>The above calendar is actually being pulled in to the page live from Google Calendar. You can add the calendar to your own Google calendar by clicking the "+ Google calendar" button.</p>

<p>The calendar can also be found here: <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u0aq4g3cjf6g6nnesa8mv0l77g%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;showDate=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;mode=AGENDA">IW Schools Reorganisation Counsulation Evenings</a></p>

<p>Also in the Calendar settings are some links to various output feeds from the calendar (if you have set the sharing permissions appropriately - calendars can be publi, private, or shared with certain people):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2220676723/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2220676723_6923f130fa.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_1954" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="63" width="279" /></a></p>

<p>The XML feed is essentially an RSS feed. Now I happen to know that if you paste a geoRSS feed in to a Google Maps search box, and hit search, the map will plot the geo-marked up locations.</p>

<p>A geoRSS feed is one that contains location information (latitude and longitude co-ordinates, typically), so I assumed that the Google Calendar feed would support geoRSS and encode the locations of the events listed in the calendar. After all, the map link suggests Google knows how to do this!;-)</p>

<p>So I posted the XML feed link into Google maps - and no joy: no geotags :-(</p>

<p>Enter Yahoo Pipes - and a 30s pipe to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/geocal">geocode a Google calendar feed</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2221478664/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2356/2221478664_ee9fc09bb5.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_1959" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="221" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Running the pipe actually displays the events on a Yahoo map, but you can also get hold of a KML feed URL:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2221484878/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2376/2221484878_2f877cd196.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_2002" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="277" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>KML is like RSS on steroids for syndicating geographical related data. You can use it to display pointers in Google Earth, for example, and also paste it into a Google maps search box (then hit "search Maps"), and maybe grab the embed code for the Google map, displaying the calendar events, via a Yahoo pipe):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2221492218/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2221492218_1694af6d41.jpg" alt="2008-01-26_2006" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="315" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So there you have it - a quick mashup to display Google Calendar events in an embedded calendar, or on an embedded map.</p>

<p>PS it's maybe worth noting that this post took me maybe half and hour to put together (with interruptions). Building the mashup took less than 5 mins, partly because I knew what sorts of mashup opportunity Yahoo pipes, and Google Calendars and maps offer. The app as described above is completely disposable - it took so little time to put together it doesn't really matter if no-one ever makes use of it. But if they want to, they can.<br />
Writing this up as an academic conference paper, on 'using Google tools to support participatory democracy', or something similarly worthy sounding, would take maybe half a day and no-one would read it... go figure...</p>

<p>PPS the call to the Yahoo pipe sometimes times out in the map. To guarantee the map displaying the KML feed, you could always save the KML feed as a KML file, then upload it somewhere and use that URL in the Google Map search box... </p>

<p>PPPS see how I used Google MyMaps to display each of the three school closure options: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012526.html">Mapping Proposed School Closure Plans on the Isle of Wight</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Facebook Now Offering App Stats, of a Sort...</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the ways I've been keeping tabs on the level activity around the Course Profiles Facebook app has been to check the app's developers page, which until today has reported the number of users and also displayed the last few http request stats...</p>

<p>...but looking just now, I notice a few more reports have been made available. For example, here's a report on the number of daily active users over the last couple of weeks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218849371/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2043/2218849371_43b1b4cb4c.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2218" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="435" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>There are several other weekly reports being made available too:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2219643668/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2071/2219643668_b5c58ba285.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2219" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="294" width="308" /></a></p>

<p>The unique canvas page views graph broadly follows the daily activie users, but the people who visit do seem to have multiple views of the canvas page, so maybe they are visiting several times a day?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218856813/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2218856813_e417071b86.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2222" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="312" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The HTTP Requests tab gives a listing of the most recent HTTP requests, a report that always was made available. Howver, a better way of analysing that information is via Google Analytics, which we've been running for some time (although we only added goal tracking a couple of days ago).</p>

<p>For example, here are the most popular 'pages' over the last month:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218863443/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2218863443_11374f9b9f.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2226" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="275" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In the case of B201, for example, the course comment wall has become a meeting place for students about to start on the course. The "official" OU course forums open a week before the start of the course, I think, but these students are obviously keen to meet up and chat before then. The study buddy page for that course has also seen quite a bit of activity, so it'll be interesting to find out whether any 'friends' have actually been made using that facility.</p>

<p>Looking further down the results listing (not shown ;-), there appear to be quite a few active course comment and study buddy pages, particularly for level 1 courses, which tend to have a larger population than higher level courses. At least one masters level course is also showing study buddy activity too, which is interesting.</p>

<p>So... I need to start asking myself a couple of things...</p>

<p>Firstly, I wonder what the best way is of reconciling data about users' course declarations (taken anonymously from the app database) and the Google Analytics data? There is a limited export function from GA, so I can get a dump of active pages, for example, then see how well the activity correlates to user declarations. But I'm not sure how useful that would be? Certainly I want to find some sort of course reporting format that I can show to any interested course teams, but what sort of information would it be useful for them to know? And why?</p>

<p>The second major question is privacy - should I even be considering offering course teams reports about usage of course related activity within the Facebook app? And how far can I go reporting the activity in general on this public blog, so you, my dear readers ;-), can see what sorts of reports are becoming available? (Maybe if I show real reports, but obfuscate the course codes, it would be okay?)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20profiles" rel="tag">course profiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20google%20analytics" rel="tag"> google analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20googalytics" rel="tag"> googalytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20web%20analytics" rel="tag"> web analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20webalytics" rel="tag"> webalytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20user%20stats" rel="tag"> user stats</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">delicious Stemming Pipes Demo</h3>

<!--
<p>    I was just having a look through the chaos that is my delicious tag list, wondering when delicious were going to start supporting stemming in tag based link lookups (e.g. being able to enter <span style="font-style: italic;">http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/game*</span> to look up links tagged <span style="font-style: italic;">game</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">games</span>) when I realised there's probably quite an easy fix - use a feed merging tool.</p>

<p>So here's a 2 minute proof of concept (I've already spent longer typing this post than it took to build the demo!) - a proof of concept <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=KOZI3G3L3BGP6D8wmLokhQ">Yahoo pipe to support trivial delicious stemming</a>:<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218428485/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2181/2218428485_40a09d9451.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_1751" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="343" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><br />
This first attempt lets you type in <span style="font-style: italic;">tag*</span> to search over <span style="font-style: italic;">tag</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">tag<span style="font-weight: bold;">s</span></span>.</p>

<p>I really want to be ablt to enter the tag <span style="font-style: italic;">games</span> and pull things tagged <span style="font-style: italic;">game</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">games</span> though, so here's a tweak:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2219239222/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/2219239222_1f8a8428eb.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_1801" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="155" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>If i can find a handy list  of stemming regexps, I'll maybe work on maintaining this pipe ;-)</p>

<p>PS I've tweaked the pipe so it replaces the <span style="font-style: italic;">last</span> * in the URL string...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pipes" rel="tag">pipes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yahoo%20pipe" rel="tag">yahoo pipe</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20delicious" rel="tag"> delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20stemming" rel="tag"> stemming</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">OU VLE Update - VLE version 2</h3>

I went to an update session on the latest OU VLE release earlier this week, and whilst I have to admit to having certain "issues" (?!) with the Moodle/VLE approach, there were a couple of announcements that look really promising......
<!--
<p>I went to an update session on the <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=55">latest OU VLE release</a> earlier this week, and whilst I have to admit to having certain "<a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=45">issues</a>" (?!) with the Moodle/VLE approach, there were a couple of announcements that look really promising...</p>

<p>I wandered in to the session a few minutes late, so missed the opening bravado, but did manage to see presentations about each of the tools now being - or soon to be - offered within the OU VLE.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the development phase of the VLE will continue to run until July 2008, and then move into a proper roll-out phase (less development, more evangelism to course teams, producing courses with the VLE in mind, and so on).</p>

<p>I'm not sure how agile the development process was (changing the spec as development went along, in consultation with course teams, ALs, students and web stats reports...) nor whether there will be developer effort available to 'tune' the various VLE modules after July as we gain experience in using them for real. My assumption would be that the powers that be will see the VLE as a done deal, rather than a living platform that could, should?, evolve with use - and continued developer involvement - but then, traditional software engineering/project management processes have a lot to answer for...</p>

<p>Anywhere, here's a quick run down of what was reported on the day. (If you are OU staff, you can <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=1&amp;whichevent=1103">watch a recording of the event via the Berrill stadium</a>, and/or find more detail about the program on the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouvle">OU VLE minisite</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrated Online Experience/Student User Experience</span><br />
There are currently several different interfaces presented to students, in particular Student Home (which sites outside Moodle?) and the course websites in the VLE. In particular, the VLE has a different look and feel to Student Home, and no obvious return path to there, even though that is a natural entry point to a course website.</p>

<p>Students want single portal  (allegedly...;-), want to feel part of a community, want timely info, and so on.</p>

<p>A new top level navigation scheme was released in January:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2218665350_ab746f03b3.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="39" width="500" /></p>

<p>The Student Home message board now incorporates course news. (I'm not sure how this is handled (I'd have the message board as an RSS feed display and then pipe news to it via aggregated RSS feeds, but I expect it's way more clunky than that (I would so love to be proved wrong...;-)</p>

<p>For July, there will be a redesign of interfaces to provide a consistent user experience, along with some community feature (an "OU Life" tab). (The Course Profiles Facebook app provides quite a few social features, but letting students make friends with each other through Student Home is probably a bit too radical?;-)<br style="font-weight: bold;" /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Federated search</span><br />
Currently - the OU search page will search over course materials, C&amp;Q etc (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009229.html">New OU Search Tools</a>, though that's maybe dated now?) Moodle course pages are now included in results when a search is made over course materials (not sure how the permissions work here? Can you only see into course materials on courses you are registered on? On courses you have taken? etc etc). On the student view there will be an option to search over the course materials for your course. (I'd like to see a custom search engine for each course too that searches over things that are linked to from the course...)</p>

<p>Library search will be available from the federated search page next week, covering online subscriptions, repositories etc.; there will be guest access for the public, to act as a taster of online Library service provision for potential students; Library search will be added to the intranet search in near future. Clicking through on results e.g. for an ejournal article, will go via a link resolver direct to the article.</p>

<p>By July 08 - federated search team will explore the inclusion of blogs, wikis, forums, internet, mystuff (?how will they index mystuff?); save and tag search results in Mystuff (?saved searches? or save/tag individual search results?)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobile Learner Support</span><br />
Recognition that mobility increasingly requires device independence delivery, and that it is the learner who is mobile.</p>

<p>I thought I heard Rhodri say that the OU is moving to a web spec rather than a computer spec (we currently 'require' students to have a windows machine, for example, rather than saying they should be able to run IE67, Firefox 2, Opera or Safari, for example, with at least Flash 8 (or whatever) installed).</p>

<p>Project has been considering different classes of devices/behaviours - mobiles, smartphones, tablets etc. AACS have apparently got a mobile demonstrator (?url )</p>

<p>A Mobile "channel" is being explored - e.g. to include podcasting; there is a limited Moodle ipodcast module under development, though we still need to find a way of embedding e.g. transcript support, possibly using e.g. lyric support. Small scale trials from end of February.</p>

<p>Mobile collaboration being explored - presences/status/IM; (rich) media capture, sharing; location based/GPS etc.</p>

<p>Support for students who are mobile e.g. between locations, or where connectivity is an issue - offline moodle/Moodle on a stick; local version of content, forum synch.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendars</span><br />
Calendar items have a check box, so student can mark off what they have done (?use for to do lists?); calendar supports linking.</p>

<p>Assessment details block - displays assessment dates, and highlights next assessment. [??should this display result of completed assessment?? - is the assessment date stuff available as a service/RSS feed?]</p>

<p>There is a combined calendar view, for students with several courses. (??Should students be able to move 'fluid' elements, cf. fixed assessment elements? e.g could we not let students rearrange certain parts of their calendar (include a 'reset to OU recommended schedule' option?).</p>

<p>A personal calendar page is now available (but does it offer synch via iCal etc? If not, then it limits its usefulness?)</p>

<p>Tutors an create group events for their tutor group; tutorial dates imported into calendar (are tutorial dates available as a web service/RSS feed?)</p>

<p>For the future - export (ah - ical?), automatic next presentation calendar creation (?just need a 'relative dates' calendar representation and then set the start date, surely??); student led calendar creation (e.g. student has a window for study, and needs to pace their study within that window - ??cf. possible intermediate state of student rearranging fixed presentation calendar pondered above?).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions</span><br />
Giles - (copublishing) - how does OU VLE compare with the way that commercial systems have evolved?<br />
NS - our Moodle VLE provides us with flexibility cf. e.g. Blackboard; hasn't been keeping g up with commercial providers' offerings.<br />
DK: we are monitoring, e.g. keeping an eye on Pearson/eCollege etc<br />
OU is taking a system wide view of VLE development - ECAs, ETMAs, structured authoring, synchronous comms, etc.</p>

<p>Comment: usability poor on some futures; e.g. setting up tutor groups on Moodle, <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span> course managers need to produce pages of instructions about how to do it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eAssessment</span><br />
Okay - so I admit it, I was quite impressed by some of the eAssessment tools (which are being used in presentation, SDK125) [internal link: <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/site/icma">eAssessment site</a>]</p>

<p>Gradebook/Tutor view - of student progress; at a glance view of each student's CMA progress to date.</p>

<p>[Qn at end, Karen Kear: privacy issues wrt e.g. student tracking, peering at student's computer based assessment<br />
??should student be allowed to declare who they want to see their assessment answers?<br />
Student profile - maybe provide student privacy opt-in/out e.g. wrt tracking and sharing of tracked info?<br />
CT can make progress data private so ALs can't see it (but students can't exert the same control over their own data??)]</p>

<p>CMA - can you go back and edit answers before final submission; what counts as final submission?<br />
Tutor has access to the feedback report for each student on each ECMA (??privacy).</p>

<p>??Are the student result tables sortable? Easy to do with <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012562.html">YUI data table</a>...and I seem to remember LTS saying there were going to use YUI?</p>

<p>Openmark questions (?not for assessment?) can be embedded in the Moodle course materials (for a quick overview of Openmark - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010513.html">Openmark Computer-Assisted Assessment Tool</a>). OpenMark (almost - ready by March) integrated with the Moodle eAssessment  module - so you use both Moodle eAssessment questions and OpenMark questions in the same assessment :-)</p>

<p>eAssessment project team are looking for a course to use Moodle assessment for credit - T151 would be a good candidate I think, offering a 10 week trial in 2008J?? but we'd need to start now-ish??</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tools</span><br />
Pilot course for ALs over 3 weeks last year, evaluated by IET - forum, blog, wiki, quiz.</p>

<p>New blog module; wiki reports of user activity/participation (??interesting to see screen shots?); forum load testing,<br />
OU wiki (can be locked down before, after, before/after particular dates; RSS feeds of changes; add comments to individual pages;); audio recording tool (simple, stripped down); vote module (in testing; multiple questions, different chart options (what chart generator are they using?); different answer types)<br />
Replacement for Lyceum; tendering exercise - none of open source solutions met needs; list of 3 bidding in tender process, [CONFIDENTIAL] will be adopted, subject to contract.<br />
Pilots - MSG (3 courses from May 2008), Vote module, [Lyceum replacement]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mathematical and Scientific Content/Notation</span> (from April)<br />
Two areas  - display and input</p>

<p>Currently  - pdf , or embedded image (poor on accessibility, screen reader support etc).<br />
MathML is preferred option, e.g. is executable (plottable, for exampe) ??url for demo of plotting equation&nbsp; from MathML?<br />
Currently okay for IE, Firefox but not Moodle in FF...<br />
"About" - Can get MathML, TeX view of equation; preferences to set display as MathML with plugin, as image, with link back to the "About" page. <br />
Next step - student Maths editor.<br />
Currently - support TeX input (?); want: visual editor, simpler text input syntax; informal handwritten maths input.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Student Tracking and Reporting</span><br />
How better understand what happens in VLE/better serve students (cf. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=%22course%20analytics%2C%20part%22">course analytics</a>)<br />
Moodle recording and reporting.<br />
Develop reporting system, with many views:<br />
- VCE dashboard<br />
- document download reports</p>

<p>Student tracking - doc in preparation; <br />
Milestone tracking (???maybe this relates to learning design????)<br />
Export data at completion date[????] - tutor group view, potential VOICE integration, course teams assessing entire student body.</p>

<p>???would a layered view of web analytics/student course tracking be useful?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MyStuff</span><br />

New design - spaces, tags, compilations, items, sharing, pinboard.</p>

<p>[I will do a write up in next few weeks...]</p>

<p>Spaces - programmes or CT can provide course related views (who sets spaces up??)<br />
Resource view over content from course - but how does this reconcile with stuff in Moodle? [ ??how does mystuff related to studenthome????? Danger here of providing yet another inconsistent interface, cf. unified student experience project. What's the betting that unified experience team looked at legacy tools, and none of the stuff yet to come on stream, like Mystuff? Silos&nbsp; - that's what we want... (and loosely coupled does not necessarily imply siloed at the user experience level IF your design team is working effectively... ;-)</p>

<p>Compilations - ?compilation is a web page editor? store notes from 3rd party website?? cf. google notebook. Heh heh - so there's no reason from a copyright point of view about recommending Zotero, or Firefox scrapbook plugin to students?</p>

<p>Emphasis at the moment is on stability...<br />

Identify missing features for July 08 push; ??No mention of storage limits, export, integration with third party storage, integration with doc viewers (e.g. Zoho), embedding (e.g. Scribd, Slideshare) ;-)</p>

<p>Can MyStuff integrate with ETMA/ECA system?</p>

<p>Delay to PDP and About Me. Guidance written, with animations (where??)<br />
Uability/accessiblity testing over Feb, IET evaluation and case studies (do IET look at web analytics?? Or just single user ete tracking and small group questionnaires?)<br />
Desirable features e.g. better sharing (with tutor/tutor group).</p>

<p>Study spaces are for students to collect stuff. (do they link through to moodle view? where does back button go?<br />
Mystuff available from study support area (?but it does feel disolocated wrt integrated student experience). Save to Mystuff buttons a possibility in moodle envt.</p>

<p>??argument for providing multiple possible points of view and letting students/users find there way, then we support/imrpove that experience (build the path where people walk)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Structured Authoring tool</span><br />
<a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/site/savle">New features</a>- media file support (audio, video, flash), large images (thumbnail with link to full image), link handling, linked PDF (printable version), improved search</p>

<p>Improved tools for linking with a doc, with other VLE activities<br />
Improved numbering, internal sections for one page docs<br />
Search within doc, or cluster of docs, integration with federated search.<br />
Rights info, equation support (LaTeX, soon MathML); item ID, printable PDF, browser usage hints(??), better error handling in SA tool.<br />
Approx 200 people across OU using the tool (i.e. total failure in adoption? ;-)<br />
LTS support mechanisms - front line: media project manager; <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/lts/service-delivery">Service delivery team</a>; online services user group. </p>

<p>Qn: reconciliation between SA and VLE support for Maths; to paraphrase, "aware there may be an issue, working on it". Will be hooked in to SA process and when VLE support is made available.</p>

<p>Will SA support course productivity, e.g. rapid, integrated agile commenting, changes, etc.??<br />
Workflow appears to be linear flow rather than shared/collaborative docs? i.e. implemented OLD workflow model rather than a more agile, collaborative one. Ah well, what's email for if not to mail Word docs to groups of people and ask them to each mail separate annotated copies back round to everyone on the the doc circulation list...?!</p>

<p>No consideration yet of musical notation support (cf. MathML support)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlights</span><br />
The assessment block, and some of the approaches being used in Maths notation support.<br />
Unified student experience has something going for it, (maybe lots, depending on how they are moving info around in the backend?;-).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lowlights</span><br />
Strcutured authoring has issues in uptake and workflow. MyStuff is all over the place.<br />
Calendars and search look somehow lacking and uninspiring at the user-experience level??<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ouvle" rel="tag">ouvle</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/moodle" rel="tag">moodle</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>I've been meaning to hava  play with the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI Library data tables</a> for some time, so I had a quick play just now to see how easy it was to style a legacy HTML data table - and it's trivial.</p>

<p>I scraped together a table showing the budgets of Isle of Wight Primary schools (using data found on the <a href="http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/the_lea/finance/formulaf.asp">eduwight</a> website, specifically), along with their fate under each of the three options the Isle of Wight Council has slated for them in the current schools reorganisation plan, to go along with the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012526.html">Google maps view of Proposed School Closure Plans on the Isle of Wight</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2215050995/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2420/2215050995_51e6712d59.jpg" alt="2008-01-24_0207" style="border: 0pt none ; width: 649px; height: 269px;" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the table at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/schoolsDataPrimary.html">Table of Primary School Budgets</a>. Click on the heading of any table to sort the table on that column (either increasing or decreasing - just keep clicking;-)</p>

<p>All I had to do to make the table sortable was include the YUI datatable libraries, and a handful lines of code in the page containing a simple HTML marked up table.</p>

<p>As it uses YUI components, I'm hoping that it'll work on all browsers:-)</p>

<p>The next thing I want to try out is <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/01/17/tables-and-charts/" title="Permanent Link to Automatic conversion from simple, accessible data tables to YUI Charts">Automatic conversion from simple, accessible data tables to YUI Charts</a>, which does exactly what it says on the tin - it generates a YUI chart from a data table, automagically...</p>

<p>...but I'm not sure that the school budget data would really make sense viewed that way, so I won't try it with that data just now...(plus it's late, and I really should go to bed!)</p>

<p>PS though I'm sure there's nothing in this, a quick tally of cost savings (using the figures I found) and child places lost (according to 2007 attendance figures) are as follows: option 1: (10,424,081, and 3186 places), option 2: (15,488,947, and 4727 places), option 3: (10,530,348, and 3164 places).<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yui" rel="tag">yui</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/data%20table" rel="tag">data table</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>I haven't posted about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook app</a> (did you know it got a <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/12/not-edublog-award-winners.html">Downesy</a>? ;-), although <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=113">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://greenhughes.com/content/course-profiles-application-updated">Liam</a> have been posting updates, whilst <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/01/facebook---the.html">Martin</a> has been calling the demise of Facebook;-) </p>

<p>Anyway, Liam pushed a minor release to our 3,300 or so users last week, (with a major interface redesign on the way sometime soon, hopefully...?!;-)</p>

<p>The first thing to notice from this course profiles panel on Liam's homepage is that Course Profiles now lets users declare an OU qualification code. This was one of the most heavily requested features, so we are listening... :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212611727/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/2212611727_6298708885.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0023" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="226" width="403" /></a></p>

<p>You might also notice a further bit of personalisation on the Profile page display - the ability to set your own Course Profile banner message:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212634489/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/2212634489_6bce839485.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0037" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="56" width="395" /></a></p>

<p>There's also been an addition to the course actions page for each course, in the form of course recommendations based on a "people who studied this course also studied..." principle:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2213434700/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2213434700_eb84e97258.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0040" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="347" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I dabbled with a course recommendation code from the O'Reilly <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21"><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em></a> book before the Christmas break, which seemed to work okay, but I'm not sure what&nbsp; algorithm Liam is using. Now that the functionality is in place, we'll maybe start thinking about how to optimise the algorithm - if we can work out what behaviour we're trying to prompt... (Liam, I'm thinking we maybe need to add a tracking code on the recommendation URLs - e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">&amp;src=A103_ca_rec</span>, or similar?)</p>

<p> It's encouraging to see that users are starting to engage with the course comments wall, too. Looking at the comments for A103, it's interesting to see a range of contributions, from old alumni, recent alumni (2007 presentation) and student's on the course that starts presenting in a week or two.</p>

<p>From chatting to one or two student and AL users of Facebook, the creation of groups for students yet to start a course, and wanting to meet-up with others who are also about to start the same course, is desirable (for some students). So it'll be interesting to see if the Find a Study Buddy utility gets much use over the next week or two, with the start of many courses due at the beginning of February.</p>

<p>One thing I hope to do over the next day or two is produce a report of Course Profiles activity for the course team of one of the more popular (and active) courses declared within the app, using both Course Profiles data (e.g. as shown <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012240.html">here</a>) and Google Analytics data, which we've been collecting for a while, but have only recently started looking at in any detail.</p>

<p>As with looking at Course Analytics, identifying sensible goals is an issue, but for starters I'm going with the course actions page (shown above) as well as clicks through to the comment wall and find a study buddy.</p>

<p>The OU web stats people are tracking clicks through to Openlearn materials for us, too, so all in all, we should have enough data to tell an interesting tale or two - and hopefully pick up a few clues about how the app is being used, and how we might improve it :-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20profiles" rel="tag">course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>At a social:learn workshop last week, <a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a> declared that he'd get me interested in the notion of learning design eventually, but he's not going to have it easy!</p>

<p>I can maybe see some utility in using the approach as a protocol for describing the mechanical elements of a learning activity <span style="font-style: italic;">post hoc</span>, but even there, I'm yet to be convinced...<br />
   <br />
Notwithstanding that, I am looking for some "design patterns" relating to appropriate ways of embedding content in online course materials, or linking between course materials.</p>

<p>For example, using browser tabs to open new links, rather than opening links in a new window, or the same window, would be an example of a pattern I use myself, but which I've yet to see formally described by "proper" educational technologists.</p>

<p>(I'd also be interested to know how the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">lightbox design pattern</a> compares, because it keeps you in the same browser frame like a "load in same window" technique does, whilst also keeping you in the flow of a page, and without distracting your attention by opening a new window (though opening a new tab is not too distracting either). <a href="http://cooliris.com/site/flock/tutorial_cp_flock.php">Page previewers like Cooliris</a> perform a similar function, with a hover I think (not a click?). That said, I have to admit I found the similar acting Snap previewer to be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/feb/22/web20.internet">my most hated Web 2.0 function ever</a>!)</p>

<p>Anyway, the pattern I want to note here are some early thoughts around a "quotes in context" pattern, which draws on a couple of earlier posts (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012344.html">Quoting from Books Using Embedded Quotes</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010493.html">Deep Linking 2.0 - What Counts as Fair Use of Online Book Extracts?</a>)</p>

<p>The reason for posting this now is that I want a whole load of different examples to ground a discussion with our Rights department next week about ways forward for embedding content.</p>

<p>So for example, here's something that I could see being used in a game design course:<br />
<blockquote>Drawing on the work of Huizinga (1955, 1998), in which play was likened to ritual, the idea of the "magic circle" has been widely discussed in relation to the study of games. Taking the original idea of a "play-ground", a hallowed area "within which special rules obtain" and within which "an absolute and peculiar order obtains"  (Huizinga,  page 10), Salen and Zimmerman emphasised the phrase "magic circle", using it to describe "the boundary that defines the game in time and space".</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Further Reading:</span><br />
Introducing the idea of Huizinga's "play-ground" - <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ALeXRMGU1CsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=play-ground&amp;ei=VKaUR-_rJIrqiwHq0OCwBw&amp;sig=JmgI7fLuYwHVj1w_CfZsYwGIQFM">quotes in context at Google Books</a>.<br />
Introducing the idea of Salen and Zimmerman's "magic circle" - <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UM-xyczrZuQC&amp;pg=PT76&amp;vq=magic+circle&amp;sig=zbGVdharABVEa7eDc9xY2eN7dUk">quotes in context at Google Books</a>.</blockquote>So here's the question: how, if at all, does the above differ in a copyrights/rights clearance sense from the following:<br />
<blockquote>Drawing on the work of Huizinga (1955, 1998), in which play was likened to ritual, the idea of the "magic circle" has been widely discussed in relation to the study of games.

Zimmermann, "Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals", MIT Press, ISBN 0262240459, 2003, page 94.</blockquote>Does the deep link in the first example have to meet with any particular Terms and Conditions of the Google BOoks site?</p>

<p>In another Google Books example, this time a deep link to an image fragment taken from an out of copyright scanned book, to what extent is the embedding of an image of an original pressing of a now out of copyright text also allowable, as illustrated by the example in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012344.html">Quoting from Books Using Embedded Quotes</a>?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rights" rel="tag">rights</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/elearning" rel="tag">elearning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/embedding" rel="tag">embedding</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/embedded%20content" rel="tag">embedded content</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>When I got back home last week, I found we'd received a copy of a consultation document from the the local council laying out three options for the the future of schools on the Isle of Wight. A lot of the detail can be found on the Isle of Wight council website: <a href="http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/reorganisation/">Which Way Forward for Island Education?</a></p>

<p>I still haven't read the document closely  (I hope to give it a proper read over the next couple of days - you can see an <a href="http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/reorganisation/consulta.asp">online copy here</a>), but I did skim through it; and one thing that struck me was that the document just contained words, and a series of tables describing the future of each school under each of the three suggested options.</p>

<p>Visual aids can often be used to mislead the reader, of course, or over-simplify matters, but they can also be used to help tell stories. And what is a consultation for if not to listen to the stories of how people act today, and how they think they are likely to be affected by a change? (That these predictions are likely to be unreliable - people accommodate to change very quickly - is irrelevant: the stories may turn up previously unanticipated consequences, particularly when systemic changes are proposed, and that is a Good Thing.)<br />
   <br />
Long time readers of this blog may recall that I tinkered with a couple of Google maps mashups at the time of the floods last year (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010494.html">Making the Most of Google Maps (or not): Gloucestershire Emergency Water Points</a>) and the foot and mouth outbreaks (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010505.html">More UK Emergency Mapping Opportunites - Foot and Mouth</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010507.html">Quick Way of Adding Weather to the Foot and Mouth Map</a> - I wish I'd picked up at the time on the <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/01/gpolygon-example.html">Gpolygon API example</a> as a way of plotting circles!)</p>

<p>So it seemed sensible to have a think about how maps might be useful in providing another way of comparing the different closure options, for example by providing a visual overview of school catchment areas and allowing people to see <span style="font-style: italic;">at a glance</span> how the various patterns of closure of local schools might affect families in the villages concerned.</p>

<p>Using the tabulated closure information from the consultation document that was reprinted in last week's <a href="http://www.iwcp.co.uk/News/PRIMARY_SCHOOLS_FACE_DECIMATION.aspx">Isle of Wight County Press</a>, I put together a series of Google maps using <a href="http://local.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=68480">Google MyMaps</a>.</p>

<p>- <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.00044429d55a8d0c581ef&amp;ll=50.708118,-1.309133&amp;spn=0.427879,0.911865&amp;z=10&amp;om=0" target="_blank"> IW Schools today</a></p>

<p>- <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004442e621115925ae39&amp;ll=50.708118,-1.309133&amp;spn=0.427879,0.911865&amp;z=10&amp;om=0" target="_blank">Option C</a></p>

<p>These maps can be embedded in third party websites by following a link to the map, then clicking on the "Link to this Page" link and copying the embed code you need to add you your own website. The maps can also be viewed in Google Earth.</p>

<p>As an example, here's the Option B map, embedded (if you're reading this via a feed, you'll probably need to click through to see it):</p>

<small><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;om=0&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004442dc550386eb09d3&amp;ll=50.672965,-1.306686&amp;spn=0.217579,0.480652&amp;z=11&amp;source=embed" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-align: left;">View Larger Map</a></small></p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realise I really need to be able to add some sort of caption, as well as a legend for the symbols. If I get a chance, I'll put a proper web site together wrapping all the maps with some navigation, a legend explaining the symbols, and so on.</p>

<p>Once created, MyMaps can be used  as the basis for derivative maps (the three option maps all started out as a copy of the Island Schools map, for example).</p>

<p>To get a copy of a maop so that you can add your own customisations, you need to gain access to the "my maps" feature on http://maps.google.co.uk by registering for a Google account. The easiest was to do this is to go to Google Maps, click on the MyMaps tab and then Create This then gives you</p>

<p>1) Go to one of the custom maps I have linked to above, and copy the link headed "View in Google Earth".</p>

<p>2) In the My maps tab, Create a new map. (If you don't have a Google account, you will be prompted to create one.)</p>

<p>3) Click on the "Import" link.</p>

<p>4)  In the text box that follows "Or enter the url of map data on the web" paste the Google Earth link you copied in the previous step, and hit upload</p>

<p>5) You now have a copy of the annotated map.</p>

<p>Maps can be collaborated on with other named individuals, or with anyone -  just click on the  Collaboration link and do what seems sensible.</p>

<p>PS The map views are particularly useful when addressing geo-related issues. For example, in reconciling school closure options against the best advice contained in this government response:<br />
<blockquote>Parliamentary Written Answers, Monday January 21, 2008 (via <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-01-21b.180735.h">They Work For You</a>)</p>

<p>Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight, Conservative)</p>

<p>To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families whether his Department has conducted a study of the effect of the reorganisation of schools on the Isle of Wight on the number of road miles driven and car journeys made to travel to schools.</p>

<p>Jim Knight (Minister of State (Schools and Learners), Department for Children, Schools and Families)</p>

<p>No such study has been undertaken by the Department. It is for local authorities to decide how best to organise the schools in their areas in the light of local circumstances, concerns about the proposal should therefore be directed to the Isle of Wight council.</p>

<p>In bringing forward proposals, authorities must consider the implications for school travel and transport, and the Department's statutory guidance to decision makers makes it clear that they should bear in mind that proposals should not unreasonably extend journey times or increase transport costs. In addition, the proposals should not result in too many children being prevented from walking or cycling to school because routes are unsuitable.</blockquote> The route finding tools provided by services like Google maps can provide a quick and easy estimate of these distances/journey times. Just click on one of the pins, then select either a <em>To here</em> or <em>From here</em> link and put in the details of the anticipated replacement school.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2216039333/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2336/2216039333_4d90dfd887.jpg" width="377" height="300" alt="2008-01-24_1517" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder if there is a list of the schools whose catchment area will cover the proposed closed schools?</p>

<p>PS I also put together a calendar of the planned consultation evenings, which can be embedded on a website either as a calendar, or showing locations of the events on a map: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012594.html">Displaying Google Calendar Events on a Map</a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/googlemaps" rel="tag">googlemaps</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mymaps" rel="tag"> mymaps</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20gmap" rel="tag"> gmap</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/isle%20of%20wight" rel="tag">isle of wight</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Continuing the theme of feedifying open courseware from around the world (why they don't make RSS versions of courses available, I really don't know...), here's a proof of concept demo of using a handful of Yahoo Pipes and bit of OPML-<s>bungle</s> bundle [!;-)] generating PHP to get a feed based version of some of the <a href="http://open.yale.edu/courses/index.html">Yale Open Courseware</a> courses.</p>

<div style="height: 450px; width: 450px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;font=Arial,%20Helvetica&amp;fontsize=9pt&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/yaleOCWCourseListOPML.php" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;font=Arial,%20Helvetica&amp;fontsize=9pt&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/yaleOCWCourseListOPML.php"></script></div>

<p>This work builds on my original demo of grabbing hold of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012223.html">audio assets from a single Yale Open Courseware course</a>.</p>

<p>There are actually several pipes involved in the above demo:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=dBoWiGfE3BGKJGcQjknRlg">Yale OCW courses</a>: extracts a list of courses from the main Yale OCW courses page;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=GB7GpUvF3BG_tyxTzKky6g">Yale OCW Courses (Syllabus)</a>: extracts the sylabbus for a particular course;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=tJiQ3EfF3BGTBHV0YEsBXw">Yale OCW Courses (Class Sessions)</a>: extracts the list of sessions for a particular course;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=0CdhyU3F3BG2UUavyp1_DQ">Yale OCW Courses (Single Class Session - Assets)</a>: extracts a list of media assets for a course;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=uKADQVXF3BGVnidfzKky6g">Yale OCW Courses (Single Class Session - Readings)</a>: extracts the list of readings for a course.</li></ul></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pipe that grabs the list of courses doesn't seem to be working propoerly - that is, it doesn't return all the courses on the course listings page. I can't see what the problem is offhand (I think it's a Pipes problem, dropping an href attribute when the page is originally scraped), but the demo is good enough to work as a demo...</p>

<p>...by which I mean, I tested the Pipes out on two of the courses during development, and it seems to work okay on a third :-)</p>

<p>There are still a few niggles with some of the regular expressions that extract the content for presentation. If you see anything that "looks wrong" in any of the feeds, please let me know where...</p>

<p>Here's an example, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2200833897/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2420/2200833897_5bdbf524c0.jpg" alt="2008-01-18_1007" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="262" width="458" /></a></p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">id=secondHeaderLine"&gt;</span> bit shouldn't be there (but no time to fix it now....)</p>

<p>Anyway, bug fixes notwithstanding, the next stage is to feedify the full blown MIT opencourseware site, I guess?</p>

<p>For convenience, I've started keeping a single <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/bf242a91">master list of OCW feedified courses</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2200826729/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="border: 0pt none ;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2200826729_99086b1998.jpg" alt="2008-01-18_0959" height="365" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>At the moment, the only place I know that delivers OCW course content via feeds is OpenLearn. If you know of any others,  please let me know.</p>

<!--
<p>I've missed out on the news over the last few days, so driving home tonight I was wondering whether any decisions had been taken about the possible nationalisation of the Northern Rock Bank, and considering what the government response would be if a university was in immediate danger of going under?</p>

<p>(The OU is currently looking at an "<a href="http://www.backtheou.com/">ELQ funding gap</a>", in which the OU is set to lose out on a significant chunk of funding council fee income from adult students (lifelong learners...) taking conversion or second degrees, but I don't think things are that bad yet...! So this is just a "what if...";-)</p>

<p>Flipping the 'nationalisation of the Northern Rock' idea round, I wondered whether one radical solution might be the privatisation, or buyout, of a university by a public or private company, or private equity? Private capital already has a stake in the UK educational system, not only through "public schools" (i.e. private, fee-paying schools) but also through the <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/resourcesfinanceandbuilding/FSP/schoolsprivatefinanceinitiative/">Schools Private Finance Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>And what sort of organisation would want to add a university to their portfolio anyway?</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/oct/01/bbc.business">BBC Worldwide bought out travel publisher Lonely Planet</a> - but I can't really imagine any good reasons why they would want to take over a traditional university...</p>

<p>Or would it make sense for an educational publisher to consider making a play?</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/05/15/ecollege%20">Pearson bought eCollege</a>, a course management/distance learning service provider, presumably as a conduit for pushing their content to academic users in the US HE sector. But would there be any advantage in them adding a traditional university to their portfolio? (I can see how it could make sense for them to add a distance learning provider, maybe?)</p>

<p>Nature Publishing Group may be doing all sorts of innovative things in scientific publishing, but I couldn't really see them wanting to buy up a university, splitting off the research arm and selling the teaching part on!</p>

<p>Hmm - would it make sense for someone like Qinetiq to do that, though, absorb what bits of the research they can and use the teaching wing as competition to <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/locations/shrivenham/index.jsp">RMCS</a>?! ;-)</p>

<p>How about a conference centre provider? Many universities offer conferencing facilities of course, but how about if the tables turned and the campus was primarily for conferencing with student services as the secondary funding stream. (Same for property rental - particularly if the property company did a deal with someone who needed access to cheap undergrad labour! It could almost become like a <a href="http://chau84.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/corporate-empires-shirking-their-social-responsibilities/">modern day academic factory town</a>!)</p>

<p>Having got the idea of a university being "just another company",&nbsp; my mind then started wandering around the idea of universities buying up companies to further their aims. Certainly, many universities support science and innovation parks, spin-off start-ups to exploit IPR created research, and provide commercial consultancy services, but how many of them actually buy up other companies (in the UK at least)?</p>

<p>Again, thinking back to the Beeb Worldwide and Lonely Planet (a 'news and culture tourism' play, maybe?!;-), what sort of fit - or reason - might there be for a corporate wing of a university to start taking over "real", already established companies?</p>

<p>I suspect that many university presses have little to do with the parent university any more, so I guess that a university taking over a publisher would make little sense (even setting aside the fact that the turnover of individual universities is dwarfed by that of the large publishers).</p>

<p>But whilst I can't really imagine a web company wanting to buy up a university, would it make sense for a university with global online learning aspirations to consider buying up a web company?</p>

<p>Maybe... but what sort of property would make sense? A social network? A content sharing site? An application provider? A web service platform of some sort? Wikipedia?!</p>

<p>Again last year, <a href="http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/content2/20051014001848">Blackboard acquired Web CT</a>. But what would it have meant if a university had bought them out (or equally, if a university had bought out eCollege?)</p>

<p>Ho hum - the boat's getting in, so time to sign off for now and then post this when I get back home...</p>

<p>...which means that you can browse the MIT courseware for schools in a single widget.</p>

<p>Here's another widget that gives you access to the MIT courses for high schools content and OpenLearn content in the same widget:</p>

<p>Note that there is now an official OpenLearn OPML feed that provides access to all of the OpenLearn course feeds:-)</p>

<p>If you've got an iPhone or iPod Touch, why not try viewing at least the OpenLearn courses using that device? Just click on the <em>Share</em> menu in the Grazr widget and select <em>iPhone</em> ;-)</p>

<p>Now I just need to find a way of viewing PDFs in the Grazr widget ;-)</p>

<p>    For many years, I've known about <a href="http://universitybooksearch.co.uk/">University Book Search</a>,  a site for buying second hand copies of OU course materials and study packs rather more cheaply than you can get them for new on the <a href="http://www.ouw.co.uk/">OU Worldwide</a> site.&nbsp; (It costs more again to take the actual course, or course...)</p>

<p>One of the nice things about University Book Search is the way it uses OU course codes in page URLs to display second hand materials that are available for a particular course (for example, here's what's available for <a href="http://universitybooksearch.co.uk/search.asp?startsearch=TRUE&amp;Code=A103">A103</a>), and as we all know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010591.html">using OU course codes in URLs</a> is one of our web presence crown jewels.</p>

<p>But I'd never thought of looking to eBay as a source of old OU course materials, until a chance comment made at an OU awayday workshop about finding secondhand OU materials there...</p>

<p>So I had a quick peak to see what a <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/search/search.dll?satitle=open+university+course">search on eBay for <span style="font-style: italic;">open university course</span> </a>turned up, and it does indeed turn up quite a few old courses in the Educational/Textbooks area.</p>

<p>Methinks I need to go and have a look at the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/">eBay API</a>, and maybe see about listing second hand course units on the <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">Openlearnigg</a> course listings ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>I didn't get to go to the BETT Show this year, but I was watching it's online component for a couple of announcements I thought might make appearance... And here's one: the relaunch of the Sky Learning website (<a href="http://www.sky.com/learning">http://www.sky.com/learning</a>, which actually redirects to <a href="http://www.skylearning.uk.com/">http://www.skylearning.uk.com/</a> )...</p>

<p>...which just happens to link through to some OpenLearn content:</p>

<p><a href="http://explorer.skylearning.uk.com/courses.aspx?studylevel=Interests%20%26%20Passions&amp;subject=Arts" title="SKy learning courses"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2384/2189498694_2653e812bb.jpg" alt="2008-01-13_1156" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="355" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking for more info takes you through to a short description page for the unit:</p>

<p><a href="http://explorer.skylearning.uk.com/courseDetails.aspx?courseid=5" title="Sky Learning - Openlearn Course description"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2400/2189502354_1900e43280.jpg" alt="2008-01-13_1158" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="351" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The introduction ends with a link to the OpenLearn site and the appropriate Courses and Quals course registration page:</p>

<p><a href="http://explorer.skylearning.uk.com/courseDetails.aspx?courseid=5" title="Sky Learning - Openlearn Course description"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/2189504146_4cf7a0d09a.jpg" alt="2008-01-13_1159" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="59" width="487" /></a></p>

<p>There aren't any obvious, or autodiscoverable, RSS feeds in sight on the site, (at least, nowhere I looked), but this is pretty much par for the course on Sky branded web properties, I think?</p>

<p>OpenLearn course listings are indexed on several other learning portals, I think, but I don't know which offhand. I did have a quick look for a "Find OpenLearn content from ..." area of the <a href="http://www.open.ac.ul/openlearn">official OpenLearn landing page</a>, hoping to find a listing of the educational portals that link back to OpenLearn content, but I couldn't find anything in that vein.</p>

<p>Whilst the Sky Learning listing appears to be just that, rather than a formal relationship (such as the OU relationship with the BBC, or Tesco (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009219.html">OU Course Discounts with the Tesco Clubcard</a>)), it'll be interesting to see how the OU "relationship portfolio", as well as the broadcast strategy, play out over the next year or two.</p>

<p>Reports were floating around at the end of last year about how the OU would be bidding in as part of a <a href="http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2007/12/bragg_and_puttnam_head_teachers_tv_bid.html">consortium to take on the running of Teachers TV</a>, presumably to complement both OpenLearn, and our school education CPD site, <a href="http://www.teachandlearn.net/">TeachandLearn.net</a> (and maybe even the TESSA programme - <a href="http://www.tessaprogramme.org/">Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA)</a>)? One thing that particularly amused me about <em>that</em> story was that <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/education/higher/article2499293.ece">David Puttnam, the OU Chancellor</a> is part of a rival bid...</p>

<p>PS I posted the wrong link in the recent <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012400.html">feedshow link presenter</a> post. The demo can be found for real at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php</a>.<br />

<p>Reading Tim O'Reilly's post <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/01/human_vs_machine_google_wallstreet.html">Human vs. Machine: The Great Challenge of Our Time</a> just now, this comment quote from Eric Blossom jumped out as I skimmed the page: "I find myself skipping to the second page or so of the search results list that I get from Google. I do this to avoid the heavy commercial pages that seem less pertinent."</p>

<p>Now you all know about Firefox/Flock Keyword Shortcuts (aka <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html">Smart keywords</a>), yes? Right click in a search box and you can add a shortcut that gives you the option to set up a 'browser address bar as command line' command to perform that search:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2185621827_aa405e4514.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="260" width="465" /></p>

<p><br />
Once you've bookmarked the query, you can tweak the URI:</p>

<p> The %s is the bit where the query gets inserted (e.g. I could enter <span style="font-style: italic;">g2 serious games</span> to search Google using the two keywords <span style="font-style: italic;">serious games</span> and the %s gets replaced by those terms).</p>

<p>The hackery occurs with <span style="font-style: italic;">&amp;start=10</span>, which I added to the end of the query that was bookmarked in the bookmark properties dialogue. If you don't speak GoogURL, this argument means "Start displaying results at result index number 10"; that is, start with page 2...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Last weekend, I had a bit of a tinker with my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010531.html">Feedshow link presenter</a>, the hopefully OUseful utility that lets you present a series of web pages from a bookmark list RSS feed. The result was a couple of lines of code that allow members of the audience who are following the show to synch their view with that of the lead presenter.</p>

<p>A more advanced dev version of Feedshow has quite a few more bells and whistles, but I thought I'd post the initial version here just in case anyone fancies have a quick Friday play, and maybe identifying any 'issues' before I push the richer version...;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, here's what's in store if you go to <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php</a>.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2185618246/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2077/2185618246_f67ea5ef67.jpg" alt="2008-01-11_1505" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="307" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Launching the slideshow gives you a master view (as opposed to the user view). Clicking on the "Splash" button in the master view gives this page - a shortened link to the client/user view of the current slideshow:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2184845239/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2146/2184845239_b08095ccd9.jpg" alt="2008-01-11_1512" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="228" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><br />
(The + in the name distinguishes this version from the non-synching original version... If the + isn't there, you're using the old version, which doesn't have the synch functionality...)</p>

<p>Audience members should follow the shortened Snipr link to see the show...</p>

<p>To start running through the bookmarked links that have been pulled in to the presenter from the show RSS feed, click on the Current button. Move through the links that make up the show using the forward and back links. The text box lets you enter an arbitrary URL; click Go to visit it. Clicking Current will be you back to the current page item in the feedshow.</p>

<p>Here's the user view (the one you get from following the shortened URL):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2184855749/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2161/2184855749_b7959dc280.jpg" alt="2008-01-11_1518" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="190" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The synch button will synch the client's view with the presenter's view. (NB At the moment, clients can't synch to the main presenter's "Go" pages - in the dev version they can...). Users can click forward and back through the links in the presentation at will, but clicking Synch will bring them back into synch with the main presenter.</p>

<p>Client users can also browse arbitrary links via the text box/Go route, but as yet there is no way sharing this back with the main presenter (should there be?)</p>

<p>Here's the URL again: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/social.php</a></p>

<p>If anyone does have a few spare mins and fancies having a quick play/test, I'd appreciate any comments. At the moment I've only tested the app in FLock on a Mac...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/feedshow" rel="tag">feedshow</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/feed%20presenter" rel="tag">feed presenter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20link%20presenter" rel="tag"> link presenter</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Another thing I spotted looking through the Youtube API last night was a way of calling up a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html#RetrievingUsersPlaylists">Youtube playlist feed for a particular user</a>.</p>

<p>And finding a demo use for it has been itching me all morning... so I just took time out from marking for a quick coffee break and a 20 minute hack to put together a little script that reuses the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg">playlist feed pipe</a> and generates an OPML feed containing links to the enclosure augmented playlist feeds.</p>

<p>As way of a demo, here's a way of Grazing the <a href="http://youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=ucberkeley">UC Berkeley on playlists on Youtube</a> using the OPML generator (<em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubeUserPlaylistsOPML.php?user=ucberkeley</em>):</p>

<div style="height:450px;width:500px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubeUserPlaylistsOPML.php" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubeUserPlaylistsOPML.php"></script></div>

<p>Recalling this earlier demo of a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010633.html">Grazr widget that allows you to search for UC Berkeley videos</a>, the two OPML feeds can be rolled in to one:</p>

<div style="height:450px;width:500px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/beb6449" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/beb6449"></script></div>

<p>I guess I could now add a feed for related videos for each video in a particular course, or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010778.html">convert the above widget to a Facebook app</a>, but my half hour is up?</p>

<h3 class="title">Youtube Playlists and Related Videos, (and Neulio) All Mixed Up With Yahoo Pipes and Grazr Goodness</h3>

Some time ago, before Youtube exposed the Youtube gdata API, I created a Yahoo pipe that used Dapper to scrape a Youtube playlist page to create an RSS feed with video enclosures that could be played in a a Grazr...
<!--
<p>Some time ago, before Youtube exposed the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html">Youtube gdata API</a>, I created a Yahoo pipe that used Dapper to scrape a Youtube playlist page to create an RSS feed with video enclosures that could be played in a a Grazr widget.</p>

<p>The Dapper screenscraper was brittle as anything, with the result that the feed kept breaking, but I just kept on failing to get round to fixing the pipe.</p>

<p>Anyway - last night I did fix it (2-3 mins all told, replacing the feed from the broken dapp with one from the youtube api!) so now here's a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg">Youtube playlist feed augmentation pipe</a>. The augmentation adds an enclosure that points to the actual video file.</p>

<p>You can supply the playlist ID via the pipe URL using either just the playlisyt ID, or by pasting in the playlist page URL (hopefully!).</p>

<p>Here's an example of it in action:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg&_render=rss&textinput1=5267E98BCC86741D" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg&amp;_render=rss&amp;textinput1=5267E98BCC86741D"></script></div>

<p>I also tweaked my simple <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/be8e179">Grazr Youtube playlist viewer Grazr widget</a> to use the new feed. (All it does is provide you with a text entry box to enter a Youtube playlist, which it will then go and grab for you and play in the widget.)</p>

<p>[Just by the by, here's the URL pattern for a Yotube playlist RSS feed: <em>http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/playlists/93EFDACF7A474A90</em>]</p>

<p>While I was looking at the Youtube gdata API pages, I noticed that feeds are also available for related/recomended videos. GIve it one video Id, and you'll get a list of related videos in return. So here's an augmentation of that feed: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=e9d2800b8aea6342160cafa0127c5510">Youtube Related videos augmented feed</a>.</p>

<p>Just because, I thought it might also prove interesting to write a little OPML generating script that would take a playlist feed, and augment each video with a link to another augmented feed listing related videos. The OPML generator can be found here (the id points to a Youtube playlist id): <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubePlaylistRelated.php?id=5267E98BCC86741D">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubePlaylistRelated.php?id=5267E98BCC86741D</a></p>

<p>Here's what that one looks like:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubePlaylistRelated.php?id=5267E98BCC86741D" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/youtubePlaylistRelated.php?id=5267E98BCC86741D"></script></div>

<p>To get the videos of the original feeds embedded, I had to put the video player embed code into the actual OPML file. It would be really handy if the Grazr app could take just the URL for an embeddable media item in an OPML outline element and then embed it automatically, in the same way it embeds RSS feed enclosures.</p>

<p>On a final Pipes and Grazr related point, I came across <a href="http://www.neulio.com/">Neulio</a> today via Mashable (<a href="http://mashable.com/2007/12/20/neulio">Neulio is a Free Video Site for Educational Clips</a>), which offers home for people wanting to build 'courses' out of individual video 'lessons'. I didn't notice any feeds coming from the courses I looked at, so here's a pipe that will generate an enclosure augmented feed:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=Vn5nfGO_3BGMaZG5oeNLYQ">Neulio course feeds pipe</a></p>

<p>Paste in the URl of a neulio course and it should give you a course feed out.</p>

<p>Here it is in a Grazr widget:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/read?view=o&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Vn5nfGO_3BGMaZG5oeNLYQ&_render=rss&urlinput1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neulio.com%2Fcourses%2Fd22d7e79b64b2eb91d8ebb4057b13fa6%2Fgates%2F2ae5fe5be613e8640f525caecfa95947" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Vn5nfGO_3BGMaZG5oeNLYQ&amp;_render=rss&amp;urlinput1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neulio.com%2Fcourses%2Fd22d7e79b64b2eb91d8ebb4057b13fa6%2Fgates%2F2ae5fe5be613e8640f525caecfa95947"></script></div>

<p>One thing I had hoped was that the flash movie enclosure would be automatically embedded in the GRazr widget, but that doesn't seem to be the case?</p>

<p>Grazr will embed audio players for mp3 files automatically, and also comes with embedding Youtube movies and Slideshare presentations automagically, but maybe these richer flash assets are only embedded if the serving domain/path is recognised, rather than embedding everyhting possible, which would be the more general case?</p>

<p>PS if the idea of Grazr delivered content appears to you, why not check out <a href="http://feedlearner.com">Feedlearner</a>...</p>

<p>Maybe delicious has been doing this for sometime and I've not particularly noticed before... or maybe this is new? Previewing images from flickr, at least, in bookmark listings...</p>

<p>Do we like or not? The simplicity of the delicious interface has been one of its saving graces for me.</p>

<p>The same <em>used</em> to be true of the Google search listings too, before universal search...</p>

<p>PS readers may have noticed an increasing number of screenshots in my posts - that's because <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012276.html">it's just so easy with Jing :-)</a>. Click, click and drag, click, paste - job done, with the image archived to (and pulled in from) flickr, and the embed code added automatically to my clipboard. <a href="http://jingproject.com">Easy, peasy, jingproject squeezy</a> :-)</p>

Now one, two, three - let me hear y'all - "OpenLearn - needs OpenID, OpenLearn - needs OpenID..."

<h3 class="title">Still Not Getting Rights....</h3>

Another year, and I'm still not clear about what's acceptable when it comes to reusing third party materials. Consider the following -&nbsp; a movie about robots from New Scientist magazine. The movie appears in a free, publicly available blog post...
<!--
<p>Another year, and I'm still not clear about what's acceptable when it comes to reusing third party materials.</p>

<p>Consider the following -&nbsp; a movie about robots from New Scientist magazine. The movie appears in a free, publicly available blog post on the New Scientist blog: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/11/taking-inspiration-from-nature.html">Taking Inspiration from Nature</a>.</p>

<p>I assume that I can deep link to this page (!;-) because the publishers are making it easy for me to link to it via several social bookmarking services:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2174710281/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2120/2174710281_7a967e6d9a.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1456" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="446" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>They've also posted the movie as an embeddable Youtube movie. ALl I have to do to get the embed code for myself is click on the <em>menu</em> button:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2174756353/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2277/2174756353_ec5c566c6f.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1518" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="274" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So that anyone who views the movie elsewhere knows it's a New Scientist one, they put a short splash screen at the start of the movie:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2175553970/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/2175553970_be3fbcc269.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1521" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="329" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>...and another at the end:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2175557274/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2021/2175557274_696de1e8a6.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1523" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="290" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>How this possibly relates to the <em>old</em> issue of deep linking is an interesting one, that may prove instructive. (For example, I wouldn't be surprised if we are still officially not allowed to deep link to third party resources, but everybody does because <em>that's what the web is about #1: linking</em>.) Publishers had to give way in the end because they realised they could add their branding, ads and notices to the deep linked material anyway - which is  exactly what New Scientist have done with their movie.</p>

<p>If you go to the actual Youtube resource page for the movie, there is a link back to the original blog post, and a suggestion that it's an official New Scientist movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2175563570/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2166/2175563570_57e18c04b5.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1526" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="156" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Going through to the user page at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/newscientistvideo">http://www.youtube.com/newscientistvideo</a> reinforces this belief:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2174780181/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2297/2174780181_6ae92490b2.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1529" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="359" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>To sum up, I'd like to think I'd be able to do the following in some OU course materials with no more rights involvement than rights seeing that the movie has come from the New Scientist? (Feed readers - you're probably missing out on the embedded movie...;-)<br />
<blockquote>Many robot design of today are inspired by looking at nature, as the following video illustrates.</p>

<p><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tq8Yw19bn7Q&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tq8Yw19bn7Q&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></object><br />
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/11/taking-inspiration-from-nature.html">Ref: New Scientist: "Taking inspiration from Nature", November 2007</a></p>

<p>In the next section, we shall look at some of these robots, or ones like them, in a little more detail.</blockquote><br />
I don't think we should have to pay anything either, although that is possibly a moot point. Certainly, if the page was made available to the public for free (maybe as a course materials taster page, assuming that our courses won't all go "open content" in the near future?!), I think we should have free use of the New Scientist content.</p>

<p>Why? Because the content has been made available by the publisher in a portable format, and there is the implicit expectation that the content will be taken away and embedded elsewhere...<br />
 <br />
Finally (?!) as an extended aside, on the issue off deep links, note that people would tend to link to a web page rather than embed it in an iframe, partly because embedding one site in another looks pretty crap anyway, partly because to sensibly embed one page in another requires a large iframe, and partly because no-one makes iframe site embed code available...</p>

<p>...they do make RSS feeds available, though, so you can pull the content onto your site, and the OU is consuming that content as this screen shot from the Moodle environment for a course that's about to start shows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2174737573/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2174737573_31d1897a1d.jpg" alt="2008-01-07_1509" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="344" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I wonder whether rights were consulted about: a) linking to the BBC feed; and b) whether they check every link that gets piped in to the feed display widget just in case? Or does the fact that all the links are to <em>http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/technology/*</em> make a difference, because the path is fixed, the BBC is trusted, and we are happy that whatever content they point up, we're okay with it (as far as outlinking goes)?</p>

<h3 class="title">2008 - The Web Goes Mobile...</h3>

<!--
<p>Google already is mobile of course - <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/12-google-services-with-mobile-access/">12 Google Services with Mobile Access</a> - but with the announcement of <a href="http://code.google.com/android/" android="" mobile="" phone="" o="" s="">Android</a> last year, as well as the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/071218-161155.php">Google partnership with Tom Tom</a>, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Google logo getting out and about a bit more this year, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUk3pICUcPk">this movie</a> suggests:</p>

<p><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SUk3pICUcPk&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SUk3pICUcPk&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></object></p>

<p>Providing a live data link - as well as a return path - to satnav devices, is something else that is likely to take off a little more this year, I suspect, as the satnav vendors try to keep prices high by adding extra functionality in the form of connectivity.</p>

<p>To date, I think that mobile phones  - with a bluetooth connection to the satnav device - have been used to provide the data link, though as wireless access becomes more and more widespread, I can see more use being made of it opportunistically; by which I mean, I can see service stations and petrol stations providing free wifi hotspots that will provide you with a quick batch load update when you stop for fuel or a quick coffee.</p>

<p>It'd be interesting to know if this could work quickly enough to give you a data top-up as you're driving under a service station connecting bridge on the motoway so you don't even have to stop:-)</p>

<p>In residential areas, there'd be the opportunity for drive-by downloads or data top-ups using services like <a href="https://www.beta.bt.com/apps/openwifi/">BT Fon</a>, which allows you to share other people's home wifi networks opportunistically (read more generally about <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">fon</a>).</p>

<p>In the meantime, a quick peak at the TomTom site suggests that you can now get a data receiver at least to plug in to your satnav device using their <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/page.php?Page=rds-tmc">RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver</a>.</p>

<p>TomTom are also making an early play for chat via satnav - their <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/plus/service.php?ID=11&amp;l=1">Buddies</a> service:<br />
<blockquote>The TomTom Buddies service allows you to communicate with and navigate to your buddies directly on your TomTom device:<br />
    * Invite your friends to become your TomTom Buddies.<br />
    * Send text messages and locations to each other.<br />
    * Show your buddies on the map.<br />
    * Navigate to your friends easily and quickly, wherever they are.</blockquote></p>

<p>TomTom is also taking of from the car radio too, it seems - "Feel like catching up with all the latest bestsellers the easy way? Can't find the time to catch up on your favourite books and business magazines? Want to use your travel time productively? Why not try <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/plus/service.php?ID=13&amp;l=1">TomTom Audiobooks</a>?"</p>

<p>(As audio delivery gets increasingly attractive day by day, I keep wondering why we don't try to do a couple of predominantly audio courses, and deliver them through iTunes and things like TomTom audiobooks...)</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be so interesting if it was only Google who was hooking up in this sector. But with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/nokia_buys_navt.html">Nokia buying mapping company Navteq</a> last year, as well as getting into widgets with <a href="http://www.widsets.com/info/aboutus.html">widsets</a> and the music download business with the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4634018">Nokia music store</a>, the whole area is getting interesting, particularly as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6gqipmbcok">devices become increasingly locatable even if they don't support GPS</a>:</p>

<p><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v6gqipmbcok&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v6gqipmbcok&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></object></p>

<p>PS I figure I'd quite like to get into the ideas consultancy business this year, so if please feel free to get in touch if you need someone to help spread a little craziness around!;-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/mobile" rel="tag">mobile</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gps" rel="tag">gps</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/satnav" rel="tag">satnav</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Quoting from Books Using Embedded Quotes</h3>

<!--
<p>Some time last year, I posted a thought about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010493.html">Deep Linking 2.0 - What Counts as Fair Use of Online Book Extracts?</a>, where I pondered whether we could start linking in to clips and quotes from books that are at least searchable online, using things like Amazon's Search Inside service, or Google Books.</p>

<p>Anyway, I (think I) failed to follow it up with a post about the Google Books service, announced in early September, that allows you to "highlight a section of text in any public domain book in Book Search, create a clip from it, and share it with the world" (<a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/08/share-and-enjoy.html">Inside Google Book Search: Share and Enjoy</a>).</p>

<p>Grabbing the quote is simply a matter of dragging over the area you want to share:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2334/2167967651_e1d567865e.jpg?v=0" /></p>

<p>The embed code is a simply a link that wraps an image - like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mTtmkvzjI6IC&amp;dq=shakespeare&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA46&amp;ci=119,1107,815,194&amp;source=bookclip"><img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=mTtmkvzjI6IC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=KBa-dfNci0WvzMnQBtr7avQNqSQ&amp;ci=119,1107,815,194&amp;edge=1" alt="Text not available" border="0" /></a><br />
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mTtmkvzjI6IC&amp;dq=shakespeare&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA46&amp;ci=119,1107,815,194&amp;source=bookclip">Macbeth: A Tragedy, in Five Acts&nbsp;By William Shakespeare</a></p>

<p>I don't know if any OpenLearn remix materials have demonstrated a proof-of-concept demo of this yet? ;-)</p>

<p>If nothing else, the link back places the quote in its original context, which I'd have thought may be quite useful at times?</p>

<p>PS rather more generally, a new service called <a href="http://kwout.com/">kwout</a> lets you "quote a part of a web page as an image with an image map." Using a bookmarklet to pass the page url to the kwout service, kwout generates an image of the web page from which you can drag out "kwouted" area... like this snippet clipped from <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">openlearnigg</a>:</p>

<div class="kwout" style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com"><img src="http://kwout.com/cutout/h/87/pm/v7g_bor_rou_sha.jpg" alt="openlearnigg" height="46" style="border:0" title="openlearnigg" width="362"/></a><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:10px;"><a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">openlearnigg</a> via <a href="http://kwout.com/quote/h87pmv7g">kwout</a></p></div>

<p>I could see myself using this quite a bit if I trusted the service to hang around... in the meantime, I'll probably stick with <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012276.html">Jing</a></p>

<p>PPS Whilst on the topic of Google Books, here's another interesting service relating to their public domain content - <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-03-n30.html">Converting Google Book PDFs to Actual Books</a> with POD service Lulu.<br />

<p>It strikes me, coming back from the break, that I can keep up in retrospect with what (some) of my online 'friends' and colleagues were up to over the holiday season by looking at&nbsp; the their tweets and Facebook status streams.</p>

<p>Rather than indulging in the post-holiday question-response ritual of "what did you do over the break?", "we went to , visited y, did z for New Year", I can join the conversation already running, by looking at their recorded present ("P tweets: just off to q for r").</p>

<p>It also occurs to me that I don't necessarily need to have a camera to have a photographic record of family visits and events any more...</p>

<p>Imagine this scene, familiar to many, I'd guess:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, would you mind taking a photo of us, please...?" One hand gestures round a small family group, the other offers a camera. "It's just point and click." Points: "here".</p>

<p>Now consider this:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing you have a camera." Smiles. "Do you use flickr by any chance?" Another smile provides the answer: "Yeah - all the time". "Would you mind taking a picture of us and tagging it with today's date and location?" "Sure, no problem - do you want all of you in the photo...?"</p>
