<h3 class="title">Facebook News Mixing Desk</h3>

<p>So the Facebook Platform has got me looking around their site a bit more... and just now I found this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/feed_prefs.php">feed mixing desk</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5069664836976005874"><img style="border:0" src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RlsRTxo-UvI/AAAAAAAAACo/7zbSw5L00-A/s800/facebookNewsmastering.png" /></a></p>

<p>Just like the <a href="./010341.html">Facebook Platform</a> encapsulates the idea of application embedding that inspired my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">String'n'Glue Learning Environment</a>, so this content mixing desk embodies something that's been on my wishlist for a long time...</p>

<p>Now I did think I'd written about this sort of thing before, on my original (now defunct) blog, <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com">Micro Info</a> - but apparently not (unless the search is broken...)</p>

<p>The closest I can find is this: <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/07/rss-feed-annotation-streams.html">RSS Feed annotation Streams</a> (as well as this OUseful post on <a href="./005963.html">Integrating Ad Hoc and Formal Communities</a>). The implication here were patches for mixing in additional content to augment a particular target feed (more recently I've come to think of this in the particular context of elaborating an OpenLearn RSS course unit with additional materials).</p>

<p>The original idea, however, was more general and based on the idea of a mixing desk - taking in different feeds, 'amplifying' them a certain amount, adding in effects (annotations) or filtering them further, and so on to produce a final output feed mix.</p>

<p>[Update: found some of my thoughts on this topic on a mailing list archive: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/backstage@lists.bbc.co.uk/msg00447.html">random thoughts on a feed mixing desk</a>]</p>

<p>Anyway - Facebook have an implementation of sorts of this sort of model. Time to go play...</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>A few thoughts, if I was designing a similar system. The one thing the mixing desk doesn't have, as far as I can tell, is any 'master volume control' - you can't alter the total output. I'd also want to have a keyword system - any story  matching certain words to always be shown (or not).</p>

<p>Finer tuning on which friends turn up would be better - a 1 - 5 rating system?</p>

<p>The big limitation on usability (if you want to do exciting stuff!) is the lack of flexibility in arranging your page. I don't mean being able to change colour schemes etc - part of the appeal is the consistency when compared to e.g. MySpace - but being limited to fixed width columns, and not even being able to drag between them, is quite frustrating. It needs just a dash of Netvibes.</p>

<p>Are you on the OU Network? I'll look you up later, but it's blocked in my workplace.</p>
