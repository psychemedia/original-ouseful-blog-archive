<!--
<p>After seeing a blog post just over a week ago with a graphic demonstrating how to <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2007/01/21/reaching_at_least_600_000_people_with_19">reach at least 600 000 people with 19 contacts</a> via <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> (friend of a friend) connections, I thought I should get round to creating my own FOAF record.</p>

<p>A quick trawl of generators turned up things like <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">FOAF-a-Matic</a>, which I've come across several times before, and which generates a FOAF record from details you provide via a web form. It's then up to you to save this file and host it somewhere.</p>

<p>This is all very well, but what if I don't have anywhere to upload the FOAF record to?</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that I want to manage my identity - and things that relate to it - from a single, hosted service (albeit one that I can trust)?</p>

<p><a href="http://openid.net">OpenId</a> has been getting a lot of press lately (partly because of this <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/openid-screencast/">excellent screencast</a>) and I've been looking at it in the hope it can simplify cross-application working in StringLE. I've been playing with an account at <a href="http://www.myopenid.com">MyOpenID</a>, but it's pretty minimal, just offering OpenID services.</p>

<p><a href="http://idproxy.net/">idproxy.net</a> looks interesting too (I've only just come across it this minute) - this service lets you log in with a Yahoo Id using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/">Yahoo's authentication system/API</a>, and then provides OpenId services on top. <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html">Google also have an web app authentication API</a>, [5/2/07 - and there's now a <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=347">Microsoft passport/identity API</a> too][19/2/07 - and here's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/aol_openid.php">OpenID for AOL users</a>] ] so it'll be interesting to see if <em>idproxy</em> go on to incorporate this, and maybe become the Meebo of open identity systems?! (How much trust would you have to have in <em>that</em> service, I wonder?)</p>

<p>Anyway, it was gratifying to see a new service - <a href="http://videntity.org">videntity.org</a> - that provides OpenID hosting <em>as well as</em> FOAF management and vcard export.</p>

<p>The service is pretty basic at the moment - you can't yet usefully add a link to a friend's FOAF record, only their homepage - but I'm hopeful that the service will develop (automatically <a href="http://www.pingthesemanticweb.com/">pinging the semantic web</a> after every FOAF record update would be handy, I think?)</p>

<p>I've started tentatively, just adding a minimum of personal information and a couple of contacts, to a record stored at <a href="http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml">http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml</a>.</p>

<p>To browse the record, I've pinched a link I found on <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom">Tom Heath</a>'s site: <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml">browse my FOAF record</a>.</p>

<p>Using a templated, hosted service potentially limits how comprehensive my FOAF record can be, of course (<a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom/about/rdf">Tom's FOAF record</a> shows just how wide a range of information the FOAF record can store). If I can't edit the FOAF file directly, I can't add fields to the FOAF record that aren't supported by the editing forms provided by the host.</p>

<p>That said, videntity.org does offer quite a range of form options:</p>

<p><img alt="videntity.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/videntity.png" width="455" height="333" border="0" /></p>

<p>This service has a nice feature that lets you add new friends to your own FOAF record - sort of; click to add a friend, provide the URL of your current FOAF file, and it will generate you a new FOAF record containing the the details of your new friend (which you can then use to replace your old FOAF file).</p>

<p>What I'd really like to be able ot do, of course, is see the browser sort of functionality incorporated into something like videntity. </p>

<p>Only more so...</p>

<p>Here are two visual editors that would be useful in the context of FOAF management.</p>

<p>Firstly, a FOAF navigating equivalent of <a href="http://www.geni.com/">Geni</a>, the viral, visual family tree editor.<br />
(What happens when you get this service "interoperating" with FOAF family relationships, I wonder?!)</p>

<p>Secondly, this <a href="http://www.twoantennas.com/projects/delicious-network-explorer/">delicious network explorer</a> (thanks for the link, Mike:-):</p>

<p><img alt="deliciousExplorer.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliciousExplorer.png" width="615" height="472" border="0" /></p>

<p>This tool lets you explore delicious networks. It also displays the number of delicious fans a user has, although this looser network is not browsable. [I wonder how hard it would be to feed my delicious network details into a FOAF manager and automatically have the members of my delicious network added to my FOAF record?]</p>

<p>(Just by the by, I wonder if anyone has built a 'degrees of separation' tool that identifies the connections between and two individuals with delicious users, or the delicious distance between a user and a given URL, or between two URLs?)</p>

<h3 class="title">The OpenLearn_daily Shop</h3>

<!--
<p>I've just been setting a couple more <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em></a> feeds up (see the <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/tag/openlearn/">complete list of  OpenLearn courses delivered via feedcycle.co.uk</a>), in particular on business topics ('<a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/feed/10295/">The Market Led Organisation</a>' and <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/feed/10290/">'An introduction to business cultures</a>') and been looking at 'easy' ways of adding further value to the feeds.</p>

<p>Here's what I've come up with so far.</p>

<p>Firstly, a link at the top of each item to the OpenLearn forum associated with the course. This is an attempt to engage readers of an OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> feed with the wider OpenLearn community following that unit.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced - usability and engagement wise - about <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> in the item to provide this link? Maybe it would be better at the bottom of a post, which is where you'd find the comment link on a blog post. Topping and tailing the post with a link to the forum is maybe overkill. Thinking about it, I'm going to move the forum links to the <em>bottom</em> of each item.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have produced an Amazon Listmania list for the books referenced in each course: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Market-Led-Organisation-OpenLearn-Unit-B700_1/lm/R19414GJV54BGB/">Books referenced in 'The Market Led Organisation'</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/An-Introduction-to-Business-Cultures-OpenLearn-Unit-B120_1/lm/R1RBG5U6SG30SX">Books referenced in 'An introduction to business cultures'</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly <em>how</em> to use this yet, but as it's relatively easy to get a feed from a list using Amazon web services, it may be worth exploring a <a href="http://stringle.pbwiki.com">StringLE</a> assembly around a course?</p>

<p>Having created the Listmania lists (which would have been easier if the books in the OpenLearn XML had been tagged with an ISBN number...) it was trivial to import them into an Amazon aStore. So here's what may become a work in progress, subject to change in at the least the styling/presentation/design, and possibly likely to grow over time: the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/openlearndaily-21/">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> Amazon Store</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment this is populated with books from just the two courses mentioned above, but as I've pretty much decided to use Listmania lists to organise lists of books associated with the OpenLearn courses I RSS/feedcycle-ify (?!) it won't be any extra effort to then add them into the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/openlearndaily-21/">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> Store</a>.</p>

<p>The 'similar items' Amazon feature potentially adds remix value, too, and it'll be interesting to see how <a href="http://amapedia.com">Amapedia</a>, Amazon's new 'wiki review' site develops to see whether or not useful content appears there.</p>

<p>The Amazon aStore doesn't seem to offer the Amazon 'Search Inside' feature, so I'm exploring a couple of ways of getting 'search inside' like functionality into the feed content.</p>

<p>At the moment, I do this from the Bibliography (which appears as the last item in the feedcycle) by linking to either Amazon (to give something <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/1412939798/ref=sib_dp_pt/202-8194984-3619821">like this</a>), or <a href="http://book.google.com">Google books</a>  (to give something <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0750626135">like this</a>) .</p>

<p>In future, what I'd like to explore is pulling links in at the point of reference, but I'm not sure how best to do this. If it's possible to deep link into the actual page(s) referenced - using either Amazon, or Google books etc - that would be <em>really</em> neat :-) Especially if it could be done automatically. Which would require references being properly (i.e. semantically) marked up in the source XML. Which they probably aren't...</p>

<p>I don't know whether the OpenLearn/LabSpace metadata file supports the listing of at least book references (keyed by ISBN, ideally) but providing this info would potentially facilitate automatic book related remixing.</p>

<p>Similarly, a list of links to external sites would be useful, though it's easy enough to generate from the XML and is on my to do list. For a brief, preliminary discussion of <em>why</em> I think link collections are useful, and <em>how</em> I think they may be reused, see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Further Reflections on OU Search</h3>

<!--
<p>A couple of people got back to me about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009229.html">New OU Search Tools</a> post including an interesting exchange with a current OU student who mentioned how useful it would be to be able to search over the materials from previous courses.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought about this in the context of the new search facility, but it's absolutely spot on.</p>

<p>To be truly valuable, our courses should not just provide scaffolding for teaching a particular topic. They should also serve to act as a useful reference work; and for students embarking on a degree, being able to refer back to earlier course materials to reinforce the teaching of topics that are covered in later courses is <em>exactly</em> what we (as educators) want them to be able to do.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily how it works either in practice, or in principle.</p>

<p>For courses delivered as print material - yes, for sure, students retain access to these materials (unless they sell them via <a href="http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/">University Book Search</a>) - but they're often inaccessible, stored in the attic or the cupboard under the stairs.</p>

<p>For courses delivered electronically, access to online materials is cut off 2-3 months after the end of a course. The materials are not searchable via the library, even for registered students, and for the HTML delivered courses, it's not necessarily the case that PDF or easy download bundles (chm or zipped archives) are made available, (though I've described elsewhere how it's possible to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009169.html">use the Firefox Scrapbook extension to download OU online courses</a>).</p>

<p>What this means is that students effectively don't own their course materials on the electronically (HTML) delivered courses, whereas they do own the print materials.</p>

<p>PDFs of print based course materials are now increasingly available for download - which as I've pointed out before means students get two permanent copies of print course materials (the print copy itself and the PDF download), and no permanent copies of HTML delivered materials.</p>

<p>I'd heartily recommend students to download these materials <em>whenever</em> they get the chance, and store them in a single OU course materials directory on their computer that is indexed by an effective desktop search tool (such as Google Desktop or Copernic Desktop Search). In this way, you'll build up a searchable archive of OU course materials. Do the same for HTML courses - grab the materials with something like Scrapbook and archive them on your own machine.</p>

<p>There are apparently all sorts of <em>policy issues</em> that are being thrown up by the federated search tool, so it will be interesting to see how they play out...</p>

<p>Reflecting on how the system might be used against itself (trying to lock down ownership of the course content - especially for people who PAID FOR IT - is not going to work folks...) I wonder how personal archiving of materials by be possible within the e-portfolio?</p>

<p>For example, will students will be able to save copies of their course materials as their <em>stuff</em>? (The working name for the e-portfolio is currently <em>My Stuff</em> - check out Guy Carberry's <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">design blog</a> for screenshots. The <em>My Stuff</em> name is  - apparently - not much appreciated by students...)</p>

<p>Several things immediately came to my mind simply by asking this question:<br />
<ol><li>will students be able to lodge PDFs  - indeed, any arbitrary file types - in MyStuff? Something like <a href="http://elgg.net/">elgg</a> is agnostic, I think, as to what you care to lodge in your portfolio;</li><br />
<li>will students get a MyStuff results tab on the search results page when MyStuff is up and running and federated search integrated with it? I think this was hinted at at the VLE Briefing on Tuesday, but I deleted my notes before I got to post them (oops...)</li><br />
<li>will students be able to search within PDFs using the MyStuff search tool?</li><br />
<li>should we be looking at providing an e-book reader with embedded study support tools, such as annotation tools, for use within the e-portfolio? O'Reilly Safari U e-books can be viewed using an interesting looking reader from <a href="http://www.fourteen40.com/">Fourteen40</a></li><br />
<li>how long will students retain access to content stored in MyStuff? Again, I think it was suggested at the VLE briefing that students would retain access to their portfolio for two years (2 years after what, I don't recall... completion of their last course, perhaps?) In addition, it was stated that access to the portfolio would continue between course presentations. Which seems sensible, if students haven't stated whether they are on a degree profile or not.</li><br />
<li>how much storage space will be made available? will it be free? secure? backed up? Support for third party storage APIs and export-to-desktop is something that has been mooted, I believe, but is not guaranteed. I have heard from several people that the amount of storage that should be provided is causing concern, which concerns me somewhat. I watched the Gmail landing page counting up the megabytes of free storage that's available to users on Gmail today, (I just watched it tick over 2.8 gigabytes), and reckon I must have access to well of 20 gig of free storage round the web, as well as my Amazon S3 account, which I must have spent all of 20p on last month (it was a heavy month ;-). And I also note that online office app providers are starting to work with online storage providers (like <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/omnidrive-becomes-perfect-with-zoho/">Zoho and Omnidrive</a>, for example).</li></ol></p>

<p>The idea of gaming the portfolio also came to mind - by which I mean students using the portfolio to store electronic copies of course materials - exactly those materials to which student access is cut-off from after 2-3 months.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it may make sense to have an area of MyStuff that automatically stores copies of course materials from presentations the student has studied, (maybe <em>without</em> a bulk export option even). This material could then linger in MyStuff while the student still has access to their e-portfolio. Or maybe, if the student has stated an interest in pursuing a degree programme (rather than one or two courses) this statement flags the retention of course materials within their portfolio. The student's ostensible commitment to a degree programme then provides the 'perk' of legacy course materials within their portfolio.</p>

<p>Breaking the problem of (search) access to course materials down a little further, I think we can identify:<br />
<ol><li>course materials for courses the student is currently studying (or has recently finished); the time at which course materials become searchable is also related to this. Do students gain access when they register for a course, or a week or two before the course start date (why not 3 weeks in advance, or 4?), or on the actual start date itself?</li><br />
<li>course materials from courses the student has previously studied; this is partly addressed in the discussion above relating to preserving access to previously studied materials via the e-portfolio;</li><br />
<li>materials from courses the student has not yet studied; preventing students from studying these materials means they cannot skim the materials for a course online, even if they are considering taking that course. Google booksearch and Amazon both support limited browsing of books, so why can't we do the same for our materials. <em>Especially</em> when it's not necessarily the course materials that represent the OU's value proposition.</li></ol></p>

<p>The easiest way of handling search over these three classes is to let registered students <em>search over all of them</em> - forgetting about access permissions and seeing this as a <em>usability</em> issue - and then provide obvious search limits/filters for previously studied courses and currently studied courses. Maybe inspection - or download - of materials outside these limits needs to be restricted? I don't know...</p>

<p>One final question to think about - if students could search over the whole OU course corpus, and a student studying a level 2 course turned up something relevant from a related level 3 course that they used to improve their understanding of the topic being studied, would we be happy or sad? If they found a level 1 treatment of the subject (in a course the student <em>had not studied</em>) that clarified for the student a misconception about, or unstated assumption in, the level 2 material, would we be happy or sad?</p>

<p>Related to this - are students more or less likely to take follow on courses if they stumble across materials from those courses while researching topics covered in lower level courses?</p>

<p>I gave a presentation yesterday on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/harnessing-new-technologies/">Harnessing New Technologies</a> to an <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/">ICT</a> departmental 'teaching strategy' workshop, that also included members of a couple of other groups from the (current) <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/">Technology Faculty</a> - <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tm/">Technology Management</a>, the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q02F37">Information Systems</a> MSc team - as well as a couple of members  of the <a href="http://computing.open.ac.uk/">Computing</a> department.</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=19968&doc=harnessing-new-technologies-1592" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=19968&doc=harnessing-new-technologies-1592" /></object></p>

<p>One of the slides I showed was a <a href="http://fplanque.net/Blog/Content/it/2006/gartner_hype_cycle_2006_large.jpg">pinched-from-the-web graphic</a> of the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475">Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle for 2006</a>.</p>

<p>The Hype Cycle structure looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gartner.com/resources/130100/130115/gartners_hyp_f2.gif" alt="gartner emerging technologies hype cycle 2005" /></p>

<p>What I like about this graphical device is that it can be used to illustrate stories. The story I'm working on may or may not have anything to with the Gartner interpretation of the curve, but it works for me. As a story. Sometimes.</p>

<p>Here's how it goes...possibly - I'll make it up as I go along:</p>

<blockquote>Once upon a time (note that once - it means once; it means this is a story) a technological breakthrough made all sorts of new and wonderful things possible.

<p>The geeks started to play, the technology was touted as being capable of solving all the world's problems and the media had a field day. The technology only half-worked, of course, but the early adopters were forgiving, partly because they could put up with a bug or two, partly because there were lots of new, low-hanging fruit applications of the technology appearing on a regular basis. And so people could play, and they could see that all the promised <em>really</em> wonderful things were only a matter of time away.</p>

<p>Word got out and the early-middle adopters started to come to the party. The technology still didn't work properly, and the users were not happy bunnies. Word got out again... but a different word this time. Not a nice word. A nasty word.</p>

<p>The techies continued working on the problems, resolving the usability issues, fixing the bugs. The apps came together, reliability improved, and people started using the new applications. Not loudly, quietly.</p>

<p>More people used the apps. And more. A few more each day. Have you tried this? they said to each other. </p>

<p>The apps started to be used. More than that, they started to be used every day. Just every day. You know - one of those things you <em>just</em> use every day. Because they do the job. Not like the first "you HAVE to try THIS" time around. More of "that? Yeah - we use that too" kind of way.</p>

<p>Clink (what's the sound of a light bulb going on?)</p>

<p>Hey guys - you seen this? I can see the headline already: "Technological breakthrough"</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - a couple of things about this. Firstly, I wonder about the 'fractal' (self-similar) nature of the Hype Cycle (does the model really work better if you think of it in terms of hype cycles on hype cycles?).</p>

<p>Secondly, I wonder whether or not hype cycle stories can be merged with disruptive technology tales? Does a disruptive technology curve start with a hype cycle whose peak of inflated expectations is the very first foray of the new technology into a market it may later disrupt?</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - that's off the point.... the point of the post, at least when I started to write it, was - is - to pose the question: </p>

<p>Whether or not you believe that the correctness of the Hype Cycle as a predictive device, a question I keep pondering is: given the timescales over which OU courses are: a) produced, and b) expected to survive, what technologies are the ones we should write about and expect to use within the courses?</p>

<p>That is, when we start looking for subject matter for future ICT courses and curricula, where on the most current hype cycle should we be looking for inspiration?</p>

<p>More on this another day...</p>

<h3 class="title">New OU Search Tools</h3>

<!--
<p>At a show'n'tell session for the new OU VLE yesterday (which in the best tradition of IT projects is largely late, under-resourced and, er, late) the new <a href='http://css2.open.ac.uk/search/search.aspx'>OU search interface</a> was demonstrated. The service is live, but unless you're into that sort of thing you perhaps haven't noticed, or seen much new it for you. So here are a few things I spotted about it (more later when I get a chance to look at the Advanced Search tools).</p>

<p>If you are signed in to the OU website as a staff member, you'll get a search interface like this:</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ouSearch1.jpg' alt='OU search interface' /></p>

<p>The <em>course materials</em> option is permissions sensitive and searches over what exactly, I'm not sure (more info when I have it/have dug a bit deeper...)</p>

<p>As a staff member I get to search 'all' OU materials; for a student regsitered on one or more courses, they would have options to search over the materials for each of the courses they are currently registered on. (<s>If anyone can send me a screenshot of what a 'student' interface looks like, I'd appreciate that.</s> Thanks Richard :-)</p>

<p><img alt="ouCourseSearch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouCourseSearch.png" width="449" height="188" border="0" /></p>

<p>The other options are available to public/unauthenticated visitors to the site. The provision of the OpenLearn  (not <em>Open Learn</em>?) materials search is an interesting - and welcome - one, though the rationale behind its provision is not clear to me.</p>

<p>The results page is a tabbed display over the fields selected for the search:</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ouSearch2.jpg' alt='OU search tabbed results' /></p>

<p>I don't like the the list above the results, particularly - I think something like the <a href='http://clusty.com'>Clusty</a> interface is far tidier:</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/clustySearch.jpg' alt='OU search tabbed results' /></p>

<p>Looking at the item level results, I think that emphasising the the search results is a good idea, but I'm not sure about the colour of the URL? I find it a bit dominant/too close to red (which pulls at the user's attention a little too much for my liking ).</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ouSearch3.jpg' alt='OU search item level result' /></p>

<p>I wonder whether any eyetracking tests were run on a monochrome mockup of the results page? For example, do most users use the URL to help them filter the results/choose the ones they are going to click through? (I don't recall reading a critique of this before - must chase that up...) Certainly, I'd expect that attention will be drawn to the URL in the current scheme by virtue of the colour, so it would good to know why/how users use this info, even if it's an unconscious use.</p>

<p>[Reflecting on this personally, I think I use the URL in a results item to see - <br />
a) where the source is; I discount things like http//:my.site.is.brilliant.com/climateChange.htm<br />
b) what the filetype is (for occasions when I'm after a known doc type and am too lazy to limit the search (does OU advanced search support filetype: limits, I wonder? :-)]</p>

<p>On a related issue, I wonder how  (if?) users use the percentage relevance score to any great extent (and this metirc is relevant according to what, exactly?) Is the relevance score typically used by people when they are on page 2 or 3 of the results listing, maybe, as a guide for when to stop looking at lower results pages? Or evenm to judge whether the <em>any</em> of the results are relevant (perhaps reinforced by briefly clciking through to, and scanning over, one or two sample results?)</p>

<p>The page size (<em>23k</em> etc) is another of those features that  I know I use it as a crib, on occasion. For example, when I come across a pdf or ppt file, I use file size as clue to how large the doc is likely to be, and infer in part from that how detailed it is and how long it will take to a) download; and b) read! In fact, I actually use filesize more rigorously than that, because I use it to decide whether or not I'll preview the document/skim it 'online' and either download it to read it later, bookmark the link, or print it off unread. (I tend to bookmark/download larger docs, skim smaller ones).</p>

<p>Looking at the bottom of the page, we get the search box pre-loaded woth the current search term:</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ouSearch4.jpg' alt='OU search again' /></p>

<p>While I'm all for this, I'd actually prefer it if the search box  was at the top of the page too - (like on most search engines). I wonder if there is any reason for NOT doing that in this case? The current scheme forces you to glance over all the search results before you can run another search. For users who can discount the search as returning useless results by skimming the top two or three results, it's not obvious <em>how</em> to run another search if the search box is below the fold.</p>

<p>On a design point, the width of the <em>Search again</em> box is not the same as the width of the results listings, which jars on my eye a little? There are two alternatives here, I guess - to centre the Search Again? box, or make it the same width?</p>

<p>One final point is that the new OU search design is different to the 'new' <a href="http://search.open.ac.uk/kbroker/library/search.sim">Library search</a> (developed last year):</p>

<p><img src='http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ouSearch5.jpg' alt='Library search results' /></p>

<p>I wonder if there is an intention to normalise/standardise these? Certainly, I'd expectLibrary search results to start to appearing in the main OU search tool at some point - the design seems like it has been set up to be extensible (though the lenght of checkbox lists may start to become problematic unless they are moved to a sidebar).</p>

<!--
<p>Just a quickie - I created a <a href="http://www.dappit.com">Dappit</a> application to search OpenLearn (<a href="http://www.dappit.com/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=OpenLearnSearch"><em>OpenLearn Search</em> Dapp</a>)  - which took all of 10 minutes - so you can now search OpenLearn and get RSS or XML formatted results.</p>

<p>I also knocked up a simple GrazrScript file to consume the RSS feed output: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml">OpenLearn Search in GrazrScript</a>.</p>

<p>Here's an example (you'll probably have to click-thru if you are reading this in a feedreader):</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml"></script>
</div>

<p>The folks at Grazr also make it easy to <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml">add this search tool</a> to various services such as the Google IG Personal Homepage, Netvibes, etc. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/ig/add?moduleurl=http://grazr.com/jx/widget.pl?destEQGoogleIGQSTfileEQhttp://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/plus-Google-IG.gif" border="0" alt="add to google IG" /></a> <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/AddFlake.aspx?URL=http://grazr.com/jx/widget.pl?destEQPageflakesQSTfileEQhttp://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/plus-Pageflakes.gif" border="0" alt="add to Pageflakes" /></a> <a href="http://eco.netvibes.com/subscribe.php?url=http://grazr.com/jx/widget.pl?destEQNetvibesQSTfileEQhttp://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/plus-netvibes.png" border="0" alt="add to Netvibes" /></a></p>

<p>(Dappit also claims to let you add a service to Netvibes, but I couldn't get it to generate a Netvibes panel with a search box for me?)</p>

<p>You can also use the search tool using my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrNav/blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml">grazrNav</a> page.</p>

<p>To use this service in general, prefix the URL (without the <em>http://</em>) of a page that contains an autodiscoverable web feed (OPML or RSS), or the URL of an actual web feed, with <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrNav</em>.</p>

<p>For example: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrNav/blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml</em></p>

<p>This also works for things like delicious, where the feed is autodiscoverable (clever old Grazr... ;-):</p>

<p>For example: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrNav/del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru"><em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrNav/del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru</em></a></p>

<p>This service will then load the discovered/actual feeds into a Grazr widget acting as a left hand navigation bar. Clicking through to a page linked to from the feed will load it into the main 'body' of the page.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Discounts with the Tesco Clubcard</h3>

...or should that title be: Towards a TescOU? ?! An interesting announcement I just picked up from an OU student blogger about the forthcoming Tesco Clubcard deal that will allow the use of Tesco Clubcard vouchers in full or part-payment...
<!--
<p>...or should that title be: <em>Towards a TescOU?</em> ?!</p>

<p>An interesting announcement I just picked up from an <a href="http://larnach.blogspot.com/2007/01/tesco-club-card-vouchers-and-ou.html">OU student blogger</a> about the forthcoming Tesco Clubcard deal that will allow the use of Tesco Clubcard vouchers in full or part-payment for OU courses: <a href="http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/deals/product.aspx?R=456&bci=4294966476%7CEducation">Tesco Education Deals</a>.</p>

<p>[For non-UK readers, <a href="http://www.tescocorporate.com/">Tesco</a> is to UK supermarkets what Google is to web search. Their dominance of the market means they can't help but be evil, as their large stores get larger and their ownership of smaller convenience stores develops apace.]</p>

<p>A couple of interesting things to notice about the announcement. Firstly, the link from the Tesco site is to the OU at <a href="http://www.openuniversity.co.uk/clubcarddeals">www.openuniversity<strong>.co.uk</strong>/clubcarddeals</a>. </p>

<p><img alt="oucouk.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oucouk.png" width="587" height="65" border="0" /></p>

<p>Secondly, the advertising slogan that's being used for the campaign:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/ouseful/RbOjUayC72I/AAAAAAAAAAw/ZKZ73Nh0lro/OUtesco.png" alt="OU Tesco ad - feed your mind -  - if you see this, Picasa is not serving up the image, again...." /></p>

<p>I have to admit the first thing I thought of on seeing this was the <a href="http://www.planetdogrecords.com/comp.html">Planet Dog record label</a> who used the title "Feed Your Head" for several compilations ;-)</p>

<p>Another thing to notice about the landing page is the "Get instant answers" query box, which seems to feed in to a natural language asking, FAQ answering service provided by a company called <a href="http://askadmission.net">askadmission</a>, who don't seem to have a  working homepage at the moment. Googling them turns up several academic institutions who use the service, which seems to run under the "Virtual Advisor" brand.</p>

<p>The OU landing page for this QnA service is <a href="http://www.askadmission.net/open/aeresults.aspx">here</a>; although an OU branded page is offered for the resutls, you still see the askadmission URL, which is a bit scrappy.</p>

<p>Back to the Tesco deal, and it's informative to see who else has signed up to their <em>education products</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="tescoEducation.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tescoEducation.png" width="582" height="55" border="0" /></p>

<p>I wonder when Tesco will start selling education products, as well as finance deals, telecoms services and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5396488.stm">"own brand" software</a> at their supermarket cash tills?</p>

<p>This isn't necessarily as far-fetched as it sounds - Tesco already run <a href="http://www.tesco-debut.com/">Tesco Debut</a> - which offers "on-line training and development, financial guidance, discounts and career advice to help 16-24 year-olds through the transition from full-time education to full-time careers."</p>

<p>And get this - "So far, 21,071 students have become members of Debut, and we have launched our Debut Clearing House scheme, which organises transfers for students between their home stores and stores local to their university." Ah, bless...</p>

<p>(If you know anyone who can get me screenshots from inside the site, I'd be interested to see them. Maybe I need to set up a Tesco Blogoscoped site to track this sort of stuff?)</p>

<p>Anyway - back to the Clubcard site: at the moment the OU is one of five items listed in the Tesco education deals area, the others being Brilliant Books, Linguaphone (who get two entries for some reason) and The National Extension College.</p>

<p>As the Tesco deals give you £10 worth of tokens for every £2.50 worth of tokens ('earned' at a conversion rate of 1 pence per point, and 1 point per pound spent) I'd be interested to know how the cash flows for making up the 4:1 exchange rate (and what <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk">HEFCE</a> might have to say about that ;-)</p>

<p>What with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/gift-vouchers/">OU Gift Vouchers</a> as well as Tesco Clubcard vouchers, I'm starting to wonder again just what it is we <em>sell</em>, exactly?</p>

<!--
<p>Chatting to Nick Heap, Chair of the OU's <a href="http://telemat.open.ac.uk/webapps/">Web Applications Development Certificate courses</a>, about 'feedcycles' (like the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em></a> feeds) the other day, he pointed out yet another obvious and efficient way of doing part of it if we're to deliver content at scale using feedcycles ('static', pre-written, web feeds whose content is delivered according to a schedule determined by the user when they subscribe):</p>

<p>Simply run a job on each feed to create offline files/records that contain either a single item (one each for each delivery item - so e.g. delivery_item(n) would contain the <em>n</em>the item) or the list of items to date, plus the current one (so for example, the delivery_to_date(3) record would contain the first three delivery items, plus the current one (indexing from 0...)).</p>

<p>I've also started wondering what other options we might offer to allow users to schedule deliveries within their own feeds.</p>

<p>The options I've come up with include the <em>delivery time</em> (i.e. time of day each new item appears), the <em>delivery start date</em> (so for example I may want content to start next Tuesday; a 'header' item describing the feed would be made available immediately);  the <em>delivery period</em> (i.e. how frequently new items should appear); the <em>number of items in the first delivery</em> (a user may want to start with several items immediately - hmm, so I need an <em>Immediate start</em> button somewhere...); the <em>number of items per delivery</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a demo: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedCycle.php">schedule my feed</a> [URL subject to change]</p>

<p>I need to define some URL arguments to carry this information, which maybe something the folks at <a href="http://feedcycle.co.uk">FeedCycle</a> would be interested in chatting about/would have an opinion on?</p>

<p>I also need a way for subscribers to a feed to  - somehow - demand additional items? Hmm - maybe a <em>getahead</em> argument could do this? Users would add <em>?getahead=2</em> to the subscription URL to get the next 2 items over an above what they are already being fed? <em>getahead</em> would have to be relative - so to get the next two items over and above the additional two that have already been demanded would require the argument to change to  <em>?getahead=2</em>.</p>

<p>This suggests a model for updating feeds in a feedreader. A subscription option to 'get ahead in this feedcycle' would automatically take care of the <em>getahead</em> numbering.  The reader would also have to not think this were a completely new feed  - you would want to preserve the read/unread state of items that have already been delivered via the feedcycle.</p>

<p><em>getahead</em> could also be used to provide a negative offset, in effect a 'halt delivery' option, that would <em>delay</em> the delivery of new items by a particular number of delivery slots.</p>

<p>I suppose for completeness, you'd also need to support a 'pause' option, that would halt delivery of items until the user was ready to restart the cycle, at which point a relative negative <em>getahead</em> offset could be automatically generated. </p>

<p>And finaly, a 'fast forward to end' or 'all' option that would deliver the complete contents of the feedcycle.</p>

<p>Hmm - this is possibly richer than I thought - and achievable too?</p>

<p>PS in reply to <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38180">Stephen Downes</a> on this post, (whose commenting system doesn't work for me at the mo, which is why I'm posting here):<br />
<blockquote>I've learned from experience that you don't want to "run a job on each feed" - or, more accurately, that you want such a job to involve as few CPU cycles as possible. After all, if each feed represents several database lookups, some processing, and some file writing (and in my case, emailing) then customized feeds begin to generate some serious overhead</blockquote></p>

<p><em>I agree with what you're saying about server overhead for feed delivery, Stephen.</p>

<p>What I was thinking was that when you register a feed *as a publisher*, it's processed to produce N  (or 2N) flat files for an N item feed (newfeed_firstMitems.xml and newFeed_Mth_item.xml), each flat file file containing either the first M items or the M'th item.</p>

<p>When a feedreader polls the feedserver, the current timestamp is checked against the one in the feed URL, offset items (one ahead, etc) accounted for, and the corresponding number of items to be delivered calculated. The corresponding thisfeed_firstMitems.xml (or thisfeed_Mth_item.xml) is then returned. </p>

<p>I see the carving up of the submitted feed as an offline, run it once service executed to generate static files that can be returned as required. Judicious use of metadata to tell feedreaders when would be sensible to ping the feedserver should also be part of the mix. The path to a fully working, scaleable system is likely to be a twisty one, but the payoff in terms of utility to users is woth it, I think?</p>

<p>As to the comment - "I refused to call them 'serialized web feeds' because RSS is not a 'web' technology" - ok, slack use of language on my part, but I'm trying to get away from saying RSS feeds... ;-)</em></p>

<h3 class="title">"Through My Eyes" in Second Life</h3>

<!--
<p>With the recent <a href="http://secondlife.com/developers/opensource/">open sourcing of the Second Life client</a>, it'll be interesting to see what innovations spring from it. One idea I'm quite taken by, and which would provide a good first step on 'coding with the SL client" course or tutorial, is a simple SL viewer widget which would, if the 'owner' was in world, display what the owner was seeing at the time. It's also the sort of widget I could imagine spreading like crazy on sites like MySpace.</p>

<p>The "Through My Eyes" widget (aka "Being Me", after the similarly themed "Being John Malkovich") could also make for an interesting demonstration of presence, methinks?</p>

<p>All sorts of opportunities for frankly pointless fun arise. Users who were happy for others to see the world through their eyes could register their details to a "Through Random Eyes" service, which could provide almost minutes of idle entertainment.</p>

<p>More generally, I wonder to what extent there already are 'attentional presence' widgets out there. For example, widgets that lists the books I am currently reading (may based on a live feed of my library book loans) or the films I am watching (if online DVD rental firms expose that information as a feed, for example), or even books I have just bought. The <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> service exposes the tracks you have just listed to through its API (a feature used to good effect by <a href="http://slevenotez.com">Sleeventoez</a>) so it would be easy enough to feed this information through to a widget.</p>

<p>Related to this, I was toying with the idea of a simple browser plugin that would use the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009187.html">statex</a> webservice to display the URL of the last page I loaded into my browser (the code would be trivial - simply update a particular statex global web variable to the URL of the current page*) but I'm not ready yet for revealing that much about myself!</p>

<p>* something like this works as a bookmarklet, for example:<br />
 javascript: window.location="http://statex.ning.com/updateState.php?id=25&pwd=test&item="+window.location</p>

<p>And finally, on a similar related topic, I was chatting with Ian Martin today about a webtop like departmental display board that could be fed by people's "work related attentional state". This might, for example, list details of the courses or projects people were currently and actively working on, or bids they were preparing, for example. </p>

<p>Instant messaging systems like Google chat (and probably many others - but I have little or no experience of them) let you customise the message that is displayed alongside your presence indicator, so the attentional status board would just elaborate on this.</p>

<p>It may even be interesting to integrate this in some way with a to-do list, e.g. to display the things I am currently doing, or perhaps those that I have 'just done' whenever I tick them off on the list...</p>

<p>Integration with a <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/22582">time tracker</a> widget would also be interesting...</p>

<p>...although the idea that this is essentially the voluntary adoption of personal timesheets (and more than that - actually clocking in and out of tasks) is quite scarey... ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Okay, so some of you may have noticed that images are behaving - err - oddly - on this site in the last couple of days. I've just started saving my screenshots to an iPhoto gallery on my Mac and then syncing them to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/">Google Picasa web galleries</a> via a <a href="http://picasa.google.com/web/mac_tools.html">Picasa Mac plugin</a>,  and then pulling the images into the blog from my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/ouseful">public Picasa gallery</a>...</p>

<p>...only sometimes, they aren't being pulled in...</p>

<p>I have no idea why this is happening, but will try to explore*. In the meantime, maybe the Picasa experiment wasn't such a good idea.</p>

<p>Anyone know of a 'like flickr, but for screenshots' service? This would be a <em>Good Thing</em> for techie bloggers, I think, with lots of scope for reuse and an opportunity for company marketers to place good quality screenshots showing the best features for bloggers to reuse...</p>

<p>...without the danger of being goatse'd, of course...</p>

<p>Maybe one for Ning to host in the short term as a variant of <a href="http://photos.ning.com/">Ning photos</a>? Ah - it's already there: <a href="http://screenshots.ning.com/">http://screenshots.ning.com</a> - maybe I'll start to use this instead?</p>

<p>(What is it with these photo gallery sites that they don't give you an obvious link to the image - even if they do watermark in exchange for this convenience?)</p>

<p>I wonder, has anyone picked up on the no-brainer follow-on of a screencast video site on Ning too? Aha -  <a href="http://screencasts.ning.com/">http://screencasts.ning.com/</a> ;-) (Not much used though, if the <em>Most recent...</em> listing is anything to go by...</p>

<p>* just been playing a bit more, and for some reason my browser keeps failing to make a connection to the Google Web Picasa server my photos are on... it's the first sign Google monster - your days are numbered...  if you can't cope with the load, get out of the server farm. Maybe Amazon EC2 can help you out? ;-)</p>

<p>A lazy post this one - the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sitesearch/bin/search.dll?SEARCH&site=20060808-144359&q=climate%20change">OpenLearn search tool</a> now searches the content of all OpenLearn units (although as far as I know no RSS/web feed of results is available - something I'll try to knock up using <a href="http://www.dappit.com/">Dapper</a> when I get a chance...;- )</p>

<p><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/ouseful/Ra08HKyC71I/AAAAAAAAAAo/O4_ybc4QYrw/openlearnSearch.png" alt="OpenLearn search results page - if you see this, Picasa is not serving up the image, again...." /></p>

<p>One thing the results page doesn't show is a 'sponsored/paid for' panel containing links to associated results from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?A02">OU courses/prospectus search</a>, which is perhaps missing a trick, methinks?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wikiseek.com/">Wikiseek</a> also just launched, allowing users to search content culled from Wikipedia and the sites linked to from Wikipedia, so it should be relatively spam free.</p>

<p>Sourcing high quality content is desirable when trying to pull together course remixes, something that a few of us are thinking around with respect to rapidly remixed  OpenLearn courses and <a href="http://open2.net">Open2</a> content that might (informally) support OU/BBC co-produced broadcasts.</p>

<p>On which related point seems to be something complementary to what the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2007/01/five_live_partn.html">BBC Backstage folks are trialling with Five Live</a>, looking at 'web2.0' ways of engaging radio listeners in real time feedback to - and agenda setting of - news items...</p>

<p><a href="http://sleevenotez.com/">Sleevenotez</a> was (is) an interesting idea that provides 'realtime info for your music', pulling album covers, song lyrics, discographies and suchlike from third party webservices according to what you are currently listening to on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>. I wonder if there's any traction in a similar service to augment live news?</p>

<h3 class="title">statex - Global Variables for the Web</h3>

I have to give a talk later this week (In Search of the googLE - resource page will be here) and was toying with the idea of updating deliShow, the delicious web feed slideshow/presentation app, to display webpages listed on...
<!--
<p>I have to give a talk later this week (<a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/eating/meetings.html#0701">In Search of the googLE</a> - resource page will be <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/insearchofthegoogLE">here</a>) and was toying with the idea of updating <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006041.html">deliShow</a>, the delicious web feed slideshow/presentation app, to display webpages listed on a particular <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H20 playlist</a>. </p>

<p>The main idea for the update is to AJAXify it, and also feed in title/description details for the <em>next</em> page into the control panel.</p>

<p>I was about to start doing that when I got sidetracked, wondering how easy it would be to set up a little something whereby other people playing along could synch their browser to the page I had loaded in mine.</p>

<p>The idea I came up with was a crude one - very crude indeed...</p>

<p>Bad coders such as myself often end up using global variables to get ourselves out of data passing problems that we don't necessarily know how to solve cleanly (partly because we still don't know how to use objects properly, partly because for a quick fix they can be so darn convenient).</p>

<p>So, typically, the solution I came up with was for a "web global variable"  (or should that be <em>global web variable</em>?) that I could use to pass the URL of the page loaded in my browser to a third party browser.</p>

<p>Now this is not so dissimilar from one way instant messaging (I even dug out <a href="http://www.dynamicajax.com/fr/JSON_AJAX_Web_Chat-271_290_324.html">this chat in JSON'n'PHP tutorial</a> - but didn't use it) although rather simpler. It's also reminiscent of <a href="http://www.shorttext.com/">shortText.com</a>, although it lets you update the content of a URL as well as create one.</p>

<p>What I decided I needed was an API something like this:</p>

<p>- a way of creating and initialising a web global variable and restricting update access to it: <em>http://example.com/createWGV.php?wgvName=myName&wgvValue=myValue1&wgvPwd=myPWD</em></p>

<p>- a way of reading the value a web global variable: <em>http://example.com/config/getWGV.php?wgvName=myName</em></p>

<p>- a way of updating the value of a web global variable: <em>http://example.com/updateWGV.php?wgvName=myName&wgvValue=myValue2&wgvPwd=myPWD</em></p>

<p>The variable should be readable as plain text, XML, JSON etc.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep on this, but thought I'd post a very crude demo on Ning:  <a href="http://statex.ning.com">statex.ning.com</a>; the name is such as it is because I'd originally thought of the service as being a minimal state exchange service.</p>

<p>In the demo you can't set the variable name.  Instead, when you create a state exchange slot you are given the ID for it. This actually uses the <em>last_id</em> function to find the id of the item that has just been stored in the database, so I'm not sure what happens if lots of people hit the server at the same time? Maybe race conditions are possible such that you get sent the wrong id?</p>

<p><s>Create item: <a href="http://statex.ning.com/config/testAdd.php?item=http://www.yahoo.com&pwd=test3">http://statex.ning.com/config/testAdd.php?item=http://www.yahoo.com&pwd=test3</a></p>

<p>View item: <a href="http://statex.ning.com/config/testGet.php?id=19">http://statex.ning.com/config/testGet.php?id=19</a> (pwd is </em>test3</em>)</p>

<p>Update item: <a href="http://statex.ning.com/config/testUpdate.php?pwd=test3&id=19&item=http://www.google.com">http://statex.ning.com/config/testUpdate.php?pwd=test3&id=19&item=http://www.google.com</a><br />
</s></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> for usage, see <a href="http://statex.ning.com">http://statex.ning.com</a></p>

<p>You'll notice the syntax is rather cruder than the syntax described above - that's because this blog is my reflective journal, and the revised syntax (rather than implemented demo syntax) is my first pass at trying to tidy this idea up.</p>

<p>Being hosted on <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>, the code is of course accessible to anyone who wants to look at it. Be warned - it's very basic and probably more than a little quirky; it's been a long time since I used a database...</p>

<p>If anyone does a proper implementation, please let me know. In the meantime (over the next few weeks or so) I'll try to make it rather more useful (with the JSON, XML [done] output and suchlike).</p>

<!--
<p>For a long time, the <em>ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> index page has pointed to a web service that searches a database of OU course titles <em>and</em> the titles of books associated with a course in order to make course recommendations. I've been meaning to redesign the page to be more generally OUseful for some time, something that will actually happen over the coming weeks, I hope, but in the meantime I've set the page to redirect to a shared/public <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful.ashx?page=6719564">Pageflakes</a> page:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5019518067218329602"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RajpFmw0MAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/6Iq7bxxNqLo/s800/ousefulPageflakes.png" /></a></p>

<p>I'm still working out what's the best content to put on the page - and may well need to write a few custom flakes to get the functionality I want - but my first attempt (shown above) contains a lot of what I wanted on the front page, if not in quite the style I had in mind.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are links to the major OUseful sites (this blog, the calendar, OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> and so on, some feeds (from the Feedburner feed of the blog, the calendar and my del.icio.us feedthru tag (so there will be some duplication of content with the blog feed, at times)), a notepad ('about' the contents of the page) and a message board (though I'm a bit twitchy about that...)</p>

<p>The page took maybe 20 minutes to pull together and represents a reasonable pattern, I think, for this sort of information page. Being shareable, I assume that - if you're a Pageflakes user - you'll be able to add it to your own Pageflakes profile.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take a look, here's a link: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that did strike me is that I can't get access to any stats from Pageflakes about how the page is being used. However, I did wonder if it would be possible to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008701.html">use Google Analytics to collect shared Pageflakes tab data</a>. I'll let you know how I get on with this...</p>

<p>PS May 2007 - the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a> now has two further tabs: one that relays links from OU news and jobs RSS feeds, one that relays saved search  feeds about the OU from various news and social media websites.</p>

<!--
<p>Okay - so here's my pick up on <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2007/01/11/blog-tagged-again/">blog tag from John Tropea</a>...<br />
<ol><li>I'm an information junky, and subscribe to far more feeds than I could sensibly keep up with if I did my day job properly ;-)</li><br />
<li>I once ran a company ("Drayhouse Promotions Ltd") promoting bands - when we formed the company we said to ourselves we knew we'd have made it if we ever promoted <a href="http://www.hawkwind.com/">Hawkwind</a>. As promoters, we were offered two big bands early on in our 'career' - Hawkwind and Nirvana. Of course, we booked Hawkwind and lost a bundle. Nirvana immediately released <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind">Nevermind</a> and went huge...</li><br />
<li>I'm a fan of the Luddite cause (Luddism was big in <a href="http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/luddites.html">Marsden</a>, near Huddersfield, where I was brought up). The Luddites were the skilled workers of their time, rebelling against technologies that deskilled their craft.</li><br />
<li>Close friends since 1987 all call me Monty (it's not a very long story: anagram('tony')+'m').</li><br />
<li>My top five, err, cultural things, are maybe <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Labyrinths-Selected-Stories-Writings-Classics/dp/0141184841">Labyrinths</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Tanguy">the art of Yves Tanguy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Appetite-Destruction-Guns-n-Roses/dp/B000026E3O">Appetite for Destruction</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls">An Inspector Calls</a>, <a href="http://www.brautigan.net/">Brautigan</a>.</li></ol></p>

<p>And as such is this game of tag, Brautigan leads into the first person I'll tag - who introduced me to Brautigan: <a href="http://www.offmessage.com/">Andy Theyers</a>, thence <a href="http://memex.naughtons.org/">John Naughton</a>, <a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/">Graham Attwell</a>,  <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc Eisensdtadt</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/">Brian Lamb</a> (who hasn't been posting much of late?).</p>

<!--
<p>Not of my doing, this simple (and one would like to think effective?) strategy for using the blogging tool on MySpace on the 'official'(?) <a href="http://www.myspace.com/openlearn">OpenLearn MySpace page</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="openlearnMySpace.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openlearnMySpace.jpg" width="629" height="330" border="0" /></p>

<p>Generate a teaser question and point to the OpenLearn course that covers it...</p>

<p>There are a couple of issues I have with the actual presentation, of course... Like displaying the <em>horrible</em> URL for the course resource (why not use sensible link text?)</p>

<p>The bold "Question 1" heading is a bit authoritative... but maybe the MySpacers need to be disciplined? ;-)</p>

<p>It would have been easy enough to write the piece in a chatty way. For example:<br />
<blockquote>   	</p>

<p>Evolution through natural selection</p>

<p>Did you know that female guppies begin to breed as soon as they become mature (at about three months old?!?!)<br />
They then produce clutches of eggs, most of which become fertilized, at roughly one-month intervals until they die or become too old. Clutches vary in size from one to 40 eggs (sounds painful!); the average clutch contains about 10 eggs (I wonder what the chances there are of there being twins?! ;-). Thus, female guppies produce a large number of offspring during their lives, far more than can survive to maturity.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/103/281340063_011364954a.jpg" alt="picture of a Guppy" /></p>

<p>Someone's probably worked out a formula for it: number of kids = average clutch size *, err, oh well, number of kids = LOAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSS.... :-)</p>

<p>Here's one for you, that I got from the OpenLearn site -  see if you can find it out...</p>

<p>Suppose that, in a particular stream, somewhere, the size of a population of guppies stays about the same each year. How many kids from each female guppy have to make it to three months old, when they can start having babies of their own, for the population to stay the same size?</p>

<p>Find the answer on: http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1646 (I did.... waaaaaaahhhhh)</p>

<p> 'Evolution by natural selection. An OpenLearn chunk used/reworked by permission of The Open University copyright Â© (2007).' Published under a Creative Commons 'Attribution; Non-commercial; Share Alike' licence. [I have to say that ;-)]</blockquote></p>

<p>Ok - so maybe not quite like that, but I'm not a MySpacer...</p>

<p>By the by, the image came from  a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/advanced/">search for Creative commons licensed content on flickr</a>.</p>

<p>I guess I could have used the new <a href="http://www.leafletter.com/">Leafletter 'mini embedded flash web site'</a> to put several images in, but no time... :-(</p>

<p>And finally, it's maybe worth mentioning that there's also some OpenLearn video posted up on the MySpace page too (using the MySpace video service rather than YouTube (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009148.html">like what I did ;-)</a>). However, one of the movies was corrupted when I tried...</p>

<p>In terms of reeling potential students in, I wonder too whether it would be worth adding an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> feedcycle feed</a> to posts, where the feedcycles exist? It doesn't necessarily bring people directly to the OpenLearn site, but for a MySpace audience, I'd have thought ithat mode of delivery would be more palatable?</p>

<!--
<p>As I understand it, two of the many arguments used to support the original case for OpenLearn were that OU courses are not just about the content (so we wouldn't be stealing business from ourselves by giving content away) and that <em>useful</em> open content learning materials are not just PDFs stuck up on the web but that community and learner support tools are important as well.</p>

<p>I've been thinking long and hard about whether I should do what I'm about to do in this post - but I've decided 'what the heck', if nothing else to try and prompt a discussion about <em>where</em> we think users will get most benefit from using OpenLearn content, <em>how</em> we can support user annotation of materials, (and I guess by implication, what's the best way of bringing in community support and discussion forums).</p>

<p>So here goes...</p>

<p>Some time ago, I posted about the rather wonderful <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/427/">Firefox Scrapbook extension</a>, showing how it could be used to rip complete courses (as HTML web pages) from the OpenLearn site ("<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008414.html">Annotating Local, Navigable Copies of OpenLearn Content</a>").</p>

<p>I didn't post a link to a sample then, but I am going to now (which is what I was umming and aahing about):</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/LivingWiththeInternet_KeepingItSafe.zip">LivingWiththeInternet_KeepingItSafe.zip (compressed Scrapbook file)</a></p>

<p>If you have Scrapbook installed in your browser, you can download the file, unzip it and then import the course into your Scrapbook. Try it... (If you don't have Scrapbook installed, and you are using Firefox, download it and just give it a go...)</p>

<p>(In fact, it's just a compressed folder containing ripped copies of the OpenLearn pages for T180_8, which can be viewed without the need for Scrapbook.)</p>

<p>So - having made that gesture - how does it feel to have the OpenLearn content exposed in that way?</p>

<p>Firstly, the content is a direct rip of the actual OpenLearn site. Most of the links link back to OpenLearn - when creating the Scrapbook file the only pages I downloaded were the content pages for T180_8 and the legal notices (copright, privacy and so on), my feeling being it would be prudent to retain these notices in an offline copy if this were an official distribution. Even so, it's not a very polite way for me, as essentially a third party, to redistribute the content.</p>

<p>Note that I could have generated my own HTML pages from a legitimate download of the XML source material for the course obtained from LabSpace and then used these as the basis for my Scrapbook file. But I didn't (because it requires desktop tools I still haven't set up).</p>

<p>Secondly, users can now download the content without OpenLearn tracking (though I do have analytics running (on the blog site) that OpenLearn are welcome to inspect). This loss of usage information is easily countered by providing content downloads direct from the the OpenLearn site or maybe even setting up some <a href="https://tubes.adessonow.com/">Tubes</a> to support distribution and maybe build a remix community who are interested in pulling in and sharing additional resources, maybe?</p>

<p>Thirdly, offline use of materials means that usage cannot be tracked using OpenLearn's web analytics (though I'm not sure to what extent this information is being collected and analysed anyway?)</p>

<p>On the other hand, offline use (particularly within Scrapbook) <em>does</em> mean that users can annotate the course materials as they see fit (as mentioned in my earlier Scrapbook post), as well as deleting elements of it.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough to support <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005006.html">online annotation of the OpenLearn hosted content</a> of course (that post is a bit out of date, methinks, and many more possibilities are now available...) but I don't think that any such tools are enabled - as yet - on either OpenLearn or LabSpace. (As far as I am aware, tool support for content manipulation is focusing on <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=18">Compendium</a>, which I have to say I really struggle with... Maybe I've got too used to easy to start playing with online tools? The problem with power tools like Compendium is that they are often a pain to use for novices...)</p>

<p>Another thing in favour of offline use, particularly for 'remixers', maybe, is that they can edit the HTML (in code or WYSWYG views) on their own machines, either using desktop HTML editors or browser based document editing tools (such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1002/">Codetch</a>).</p>

<p>This is a far easier way for most people of revising the actual content than downloading the LabSpace hosted XML document for the unit and finding an XML editor to edit it in (and XSL stylesheet and processor to generate pages from).</p>

<p>My own experiments using Codetch to edit T180_8 HTML files in my Scrapbook directory has had mixed success (some of the spaces got mangled (maybe ones that were originally &amp;nbsp; characters?)) but the potential for the combined use of Scrapbook and Codetch extensions in a browser based OpenLearn material revising environment seems promising.</p>

<p>By preserving the links to the forums (as long as the URLs don't change) users of the downloaded content will be able to interact with the forums just as they would from the original site (if they are online, that is - they have access to the downloaded content <em>offline</em>, of course...).</p>

<p>However, users are now also in a position to share their annotated versions of the course content with others (although not as effectively as they could with an online annotation server).</p>

<p>The theme I am exploring with respect to OpenLearn content is perhaps best described by 'how can we get the content out there'? Wherever there is...</p>

<p>Just as providing an effective learning experience is not really about making content available, building an effective learning community is not just about colocating content pages and course forums in a Muddled learning environment.</p>

<p>The content <em>can</em> go elsewhere, and I'd suggest there are good reasons for allowing users offline access to it. It won't necessarily mean the users are any less likely to engage in a community that has formed around those materials.</p>

<p>After all, if I'm in a book club, I don't limit my reading time to when I am in the company of all the other members of the book club, do I?</p>

<!--
<p>As a New Year's resolution, I've decided to try and cut down on my date filing using scraps of paper in favour of an online calendaring solution.</p>

<p>The calendar I'm starting off with is <a href="http://calendar.google com">Google Calendar</a>, partly because it allows me to manage/overlay several calendars at a time, partly because it has <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/nch4om4fcord4qic1arhoobtd4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">ical</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/nch4om4fcord4qic1arhoobtd4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">RSS/web feeds</a>, which can be viewed in a feed reader, or Grazr widget, of course:</p>

<div style="height:200px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/nch4om4fcord4qic1arhoobtd4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic?orderby=starttime&sortorder=ascending&futureevents=true&singleevents=true" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/nch4om4fcord4qic1arhoobtd4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic?orderby=starttime&amp;sortorder=ascending&amp;futureevents=true&amp;singleevents=true"></script>
</div>

<p><s>although it seems that these feeds present items in the reverse order in which they were added, rather than date order (today onwards, for example),</s>* partly because it delivers embeddable <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar/">HTML calendars to arbitrary web pages</a> (<a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">including Moodle</a> ;-), partly because there are some neat extensions (like this <a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/04/18/433/">quick add extension from Elias Torres</a>) and partly because <a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Google calendar/iCal synchronisation</a> looks likes it's on the way... (which means there'll perhaps be a subterfuge way of synching arbitrary iCal feeds with Google Calendar by going via an iCal client;-)</p>

<p>I know there is some internal pressure for people to start using Moodle Calendars, but I wonder if they are half way as powerful as this?</p>

<p>Given things like the existence of the <a href="http://www.google.com/a/edu/">Google Apps for Education</a> programme, I wonder whether there is ever <em>any</em> internal consideration given to partnering 3rd party sites who do offer online toolsuites (e.g. I've started using <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho</a> increasingly since I found their toolbar synchs my MS Word docs with my online Zoho Writer account). With a student strategy that says all students should have online access, why not partner with an online office suite provider? (Just asking...;-)</p>

<p>Anyway - back to calendaring...</p>

<p>The ability to define and overlay several calendars looks like a real boon to me - for example, here's a calendar I've separated out of <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful OU events</a> that internal readers might find useful (I'll try to keep it up to date - so feed me those dates...;-)</p>

<p>Whilst looking around for other potential (internal) solutions, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc</a> tipped me off about a (no longer in active development?) <a href="http://diary.kmi.open.ac.uk/">KMi online calendar</a> that some of the KMi folks use...</p>

<p>I was rather surprised that they don't use it to deliver an iCal feed of KMi seminar dates (though it would be even better if they had a Google calendar feed - not that I'm evangelising Google (agaaiiiiiinnnnn) at the moment... ;-)</p>

<p>* <em>ordering Google Calendar feeds</em>: from a <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/forums/viewthread/37775/">forum post by DavidJaymz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I asked in google groups about the time ordering of entries in the feed and it turns out there are some undocumented options you can tag on the end of the feed.

<p>- sortorder : valid values are "ascending" or "descending".  Sorts the events in the requested order.</p>

<p>- singleevents : valid values are "true"or "false".  Decides whether recurring events should be expanded or left as a single event. Default is "false".</p>

<p>- futureevents: valid values are "true" or "false".  Decides whether<br />
events in the ?past? (need to check this to see if he means past or future there) should be returned in the feed.  Default is "false".</p>

<p>So here's an example that will give you the upcoming events in ascending order:</p>

<p>?orderby=starttime&amp;sortorder=ascending&amp;futureevents=true&amp;singleevents=true</blockquote></p>

<p>PS another New Year's resolution was to acquire <a href="http://ouseful.info">http://ouseful.info</a>. For the foreseeable future, that URL will point to this blog (until I work out how to monetise the domain of course ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>With lots of interest around the OU at the moment regarding 'Mobile Moodle', and how we take VLE content offline and into peoples' pockets, I was intrigued today when I stumbled across <a href="http://mogopop.com">mogopop</a>, a "web application designed to make it easy to create, publish and download multimedia content for iPods."</p>

<p>The premise is simple - create pages of content for your iPod, bundle it an go. As well as text pages, mogopop claims to let you incorporate audio, video and image pages in a particular bundle of pages (though with a 50MB size limit per project I suspect that will limit the amount of video you can include?)</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopProject.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopProject.jpg" width="865" height="589" border="0" /></p>

<p>As I had a spare hour or so this evening (that is, I needed a displacement activity away from marking...) I wondered how hard it would be to convert the <em>French: Ouverture</em> OpenLearn unit to a portable version...</p>

<p>The answer is rather trickier than I had at first anticipated, so much so in fact that I don't even have a demo of my own to link to :-( ... nor do I have an iPod, which means I wouldn't have been able to test it properly anyway. If anyone would like to donate one to me, please feel free to get in touch... ;-) Maybe you got a new one for Christmas...? Whatever... I can always <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/services/loanout.php">borrow an iPod from the OU Library</a>, if not...).</p>

<p>Text pages are easy enough to add:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopText.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopText.jpg" width="529" height="216" border="0" /></p>

<p>Audio uploads too seemed to work okay:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopAudio.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopAudio.jpg" width="523" height="197" border="0" /></p>

<p>The images uploaded fine, but I could never seem to save them into a page, though I could preview them:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopImage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopImage.jpg" width="259" height="198" border="0" /></p>

<p>I didn't succeed in uploading any video though - no matter what I tried (from following the mogopop iTunes conversion instructions, to using a variety of formats generated via the rather clever video converter utility <a href="http://heywatch.com/">Hey!Watch</a> (which will even convert files you have subscribed to via a feed :-).</p>

<p>(Thinking of that Hey!Watch feed subscription utility, it would be <em>really</em> handy if you could import a feed into mogopop and have it generate a correspondingly linked package as a result...)</p>

<p>There were significant other issues too with respect to making a (quick) sensible conversion of the actual learning materials:</p>

<p>- the large number of detailed images are actually too detailed (I suspect) for easy viewing on an iPod - and the activites wrapped around the images require you to actually inspect them quite closely;</p>

<p>- pulling a transcript out of the PDF transcript files to paste into a text page proved impossible (probably compounded by the fact that: a) I'm using Adobe Reader; b) on a Mac; c) the PDF text was very accented French, in d) a complex layout;</p>

<p>- several of the exercises are largely designed for <em>print</em> use (not even online use...), so are not really appropriate for use with a mobile screen.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough (I think) to put one of the heavier text based courses on into mogopop, but to my mind that largely defeats the purpose? Any comments?</p>

<p>Just in passing, OU readers interested in the <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/?page_id=30">VLE Mlearn project</a> can pick up an invite for three forthcoming workshops <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mlearninvite.doc">here</a>. The themes are:</p>

<p>- Podcasting, Course News and Alerts <br />
- Mobile Course Content <br />
- Social and User Generated Content on-the-move </p>

<p>Ah... Course News and Alerts.... that <a hre="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/">takes me back three or four years</a>... ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>I was just having a quick look at the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseware</a> site to see how they structured their content (it is, of course, just enough different on each page to make screen scraping a chore...) and many of the courses listed there have a reading list associated with the course.</p>

<p>For example, here's the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Political-Science/17-181Spring-2006/Readings/">reading list for a course on sustainable development</a>. In this case, the reading list is split into a section detailing recomended books, and then additional readings (categorised as <em>required reading</em>, <em>related reading</em> or <em>essential reading</em>) for each of the weekly study topics.</p>

<p>In the same way that I think there is a lot useful something (information, definitely, but also maybe: knowledge? structure? relevance? focus?) tied up in the set of external links that are included in online teaching materials (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</a> for example) I think the same is probably true of traditional reading lists.</p>

<p>So methinks it would be really handy if the lists were made available in a machine readable way that supported syndication.</p>

<p>To make things easy, something like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/richpub/listmania/createpipeline/">Amazon Listmania! lists</a> looks like it could provide a pre-established way of: a) storing lists of ISBNs; b) linking directly to book info/book covers etc; and c) offering the possibility of revenue generation (by associating the list with an AMazon affiliate ID somehow, so if someone buys a book via your list, you get a cut...)</p>

<p>To get things gloing in the 'how does it actually feel when you try it' game, I produced a list based on the Recommended Reading list for the aforementioned MIT OCW course. Here it is: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R2RMY1YZQ91481/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view/202-1166911-6337439"><em> MIT OCW: 17.181/2 Sustainable Development (rec. reading)</em> Listmania List</a>.</p>

<p>Using a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">third party service</a> that leverages Amazon ECS webservices, here's a link to an RSS version of the list: <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/amazonbox.aspx?id=R2RMY1YZQ91481&type=Listmania&locale=uk&feed=rss&page=1&items=20&imgtype=small&sorttype=DateAdded&associd=ouseful-21"><em>MIT OCW: 17.181/2 Sustainable Development (rec. reading)</em> Listmania List [RSS]</a>. This feed actually includes my Amazon affiliate ID.</p>

<p>The feed can of course now be displayed in a wide variety of ways, from <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=12pt&view=3p&file=http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/amazonbox.aspx?id=R2RMY1YZQ91481&type=Listmania&locale=uk&feed=rss&page=1&items=20&imgtype=small&sorttype=DateAdded&associd=ouseful-21">Grazr widgets</a> to webtops, blogs and maybe even VLEs ;-)</p>

<p>Issues? One of the ISBNs in the reading list wasn't recognised. Whilst it was easy enough to set up the Listmania! list and add the ISBNs to it, it wasn't obvious what comment to apply to each book.</p>

<p>More significant questions are sure to arise when it comes to actually putting the weekly readings into a list. For example, how to a) identify the topic (maybe the list name?); and b) specify sections/pages to be read (use the comment field, I guess?).</p>

<p>Listmania lists only work for ISBNs, so referencing academic articles etc. is more problematic.</p>

<p>Maybe a more useful tool - in academic circles at least - would be to use something like <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>?</p>

<p>That said, using a Listmania! list may have some useful side effects.</p>

<p>Firstly, it sets up an association between titles that Amazon may draw on as part of its book recommendation algorithm.</p>

<p>Secondly, people shopping on Amazon may have your list pulled up as they search. In terms of supporting informal learning, this may be quite handy (even more so if there were a way of associating the Listmania! list with a URL, such as that of an Open Content course associated with the list?)</p>

<p>A more extreme approach could even see the reading list being used to seed an <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon aStore</a>, like my own first crude attempt: <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/robofestauk-21">Geek Lit</a> ;-)</p>

<p>This represents a more heavyweight approach to generating revenue via an open content course/free informal learning course, of course (3x ?!), but how else are such initiatives to become financially sustainable? (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006142.html">Ads, maybe?</a>).</p>

<p>PS It turns out that you can actually use a Listmania! list to seed an aStore, so it took less than 10 mins to use the above OCW/Sustainable Development list to seed this <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/ocwdemo-21">Sustainable Development</a> aStore (yes, I know I probably shouldn't have used the MIT/OCW logo...)</p>

<p>The aStores also support subpages, so if a Listmania! list for each weekly topic of the OCW course was provided, these could be trivially used to pipe content into weekly book requirement pages within the aStore. (Using Listmania! lists to store the books for each topic is better than entering the books explicitly into an aStore page, because it makes syndication so much easier).</p>

<p>With the addition of something like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OU Library Traveller</a> greasemonkey script, looking up a book on the aStore wil also return physical and/or ebook holdings info for that book from the OU library.</p>

<!--
<p>In part prompted, albeit informally, by a couple of people associated with <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a>, I've popped one of the <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1972">L120 French Ouverture</a> MP4 video resources onto a couple of video sharing sites (<a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://motionboc.com">motionbox</a>).</p>

<p>There has been a quite a bit of talk here lately about the ways we <em>could</em> and <em>might</em> make use of such sites, but I'm a firm believer that it's only when you "just do it" that you appreciate what differentiates 'just posting the content' from posting it effectively. And having 'just done it', you are then <em>really</em> in a position to see how useful/interesting it is...</p>

<p>Take my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMgG92PoA5E">French: Ouverture upload to YouTube,</a> for example. What should the title of the clip be, or the description?</p>

<p><img alt="labspaceyoutubetitle.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/labspaceyoutubetitle.jpg" width="681" height="421" border="0" /></p>

<p>A suggested form of words to act as a footer to the description would be really handy, as well as suggested way of incorporating a relevent link back to OpenLearn/Labspace.<br />
 <br />
There are also issues regarding sensible tagging, and the appropriate video category. Tags can, of course, be fluid, but to reconcile resources related to a unit mashup across different tag-supporting applications, a recommended course/unit tag would be useful. I used <em>L120</em> but maybe I should have used <em>L120_1</em> , or even something like <em>openlearn:L120_1</em> ?</p>

<p>The original XML mark up of the resource is as follows:</p>

<pre>&lt;MediaContent src="L120_1_002v" id="MP4001_002" type="videoboth" target="new window" supportDoc="Trans L120_1_002"&gt;
  &lt;Description&gt;Click to view video 04:26 - 07:20&lt;/Description&gt; 
&lt;/MediaContent&gt;</pre>

<p>and there's no reference at all to the resource in the metadata file that comes with the LabSpace XML bundle for the unit.</p>

<p>The transcript referred to in the <em>supportDoc</em> attribute actually resolves to PDF document that contains transcripts for several audio and video resources associated with the course. Again there is no metadata information described in that document that can help (except maybe the title of the package?). That said, there doesn't seem to be anywhere in the resource details page on YouTube where a link to - or upload of - a transcript is supported. Similalry, there's no way of associating the Creative Commons license details with the upload (services like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">flickr</a> are way ahead in this respect...)</p>

<p>Just as an aside here, the use of an effectively closed document format like PDF for the transcript material means that it is non-trivial (for me at least) to extract the transcript content and associate it with the timeline of the video, or indeed make use of the transcript material in any other way.</p>

<p>To my mind, the transcript is not a resource in the same sense that the video material is. It is textual material that should be included within the XML source document for the unit.</p>

<p>(Admittedly, it may be that in the rush to get the content published on OpenLearn, supplementary materials like transcript PDFs were deemed to be resources, as such, and the long term plan <em>may</em> be to convert them over to XML when time allows; or maybe the thinking is that the community will do it? ;-) Whilst I'm all in favour of 'just good enough' (or even 'almost good enough'!) publishing, there has to be a mechanism in place that supports quick and easy revisions of content, something I don't see any at the moment in LabSpace, at least outside of the project team. Revisions that do take place seem, as the moment, to change the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009144.html">LabSpace resource ID</a>, which also means that links break...)</p>

<p>Okay - back to it. As well as generally informative metadata, like title and description, there is also the opportunity to post a minimal amount of origination metadata:</p>

<p><img alt="labspaceyoutubetechnical.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/labspaceyoutubetechnical.jpg" width="604" height="160" border="0" /></p>

<p>The "location recorded' slot may be overloaded here with an OpenLearn assignation, perhaps? I'm not sure what should happen with the timestamp?</p>

<p>Although technical metadata (length, filesize, screen size etc.) is not exposed, it probably could be. Whether or not it should be described in a the LabSpace metadata file for the unit, I don't know. Certainly providing the dimensions of the video clip, for example, would be handy.</p>

<p>The final set of YouTube attributes that can be edited relate largely to usage. I used the defaults for my upload:</p>

<p><img alt="labspaceyoutubeusage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/labspaceyoutubeusage.jpg" width="809" height="421" border="0" /></p>

<p>Other video upload sites are likely to offer a slightly different range of options for all metadata fields (I wonder if any allow you like link to a transcript, if it already exists?).</p>

<p>Even so, this simple exercise raises several questions regarding the level of metadata it might be useful to provide about multimadia resources <em>if</em> OpenLearn and LabSpace users are to be encouraged to share and reuse/remix them easily and effectively?</p>

<p>As to the value of making video content available on YouTube? I'm not sure. If nothing else, it is easy to share/embed in other space, like this blog post for example:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HMgG92PoA5E"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HMgG92PoA5E" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Which means I can pop the resource onto <a href="http://www.myspace.com/psychemedia">my Myspace page</a> (it's the video clip in the Television box...) easily enough (though why anyone would want to, in this particular case, I don't know!)</p>

<p>In the next post, I'll give a quick demo of how video editing sites like <a href=http://motionbox.com">motionbox</a> <em>can</em> provide a more compelling (re)use-case of uploaded, easily shareable video content.</p>

<p>Over the next week, I'll also post some immediate thoughts on uploading LabSpace course image content to services like <em>flickr</em>, and LabSpace audio content to audio remix services like <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/">JAMGLUE</a>.</p>

<p>Unless I get stopped before then, of course, because it's an using/redistributing the material in a way that it is not licensed for...</p>

<p>But first - I have to go and do some marking ;-(</p>

<h3 class="title">Navigating LabSpace</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the problems I have with the way Moodle is being used for LabSpace/OpenLearn is the truly horrible navigation scheme that has been adopted within a unit:</p>

<p><img alt="labspaceLinks.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/labspaceLinks.jpg" width="504" height="389" border="0" /></p>

<p>which I tried to improve upon using a variety of OPML widgets and an OPML links file structured according to sections within a unit using <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008189.html">Optimal OpenLearn navigation</a>, for example.</p>

<p>The arbitrary naming scheme applied to URLs further complicates matters - course index pages take the form <em>http://labspace.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1977</em> and course resource pages the form <em>http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=44145</em>.</p>

<p>The id numbers are arbitrary, and for course resources not necessarily consecutive.</p>

<p>One request I've had relating to feedcycled/RSSified versions of LabSpace courses is for item level links back to the original page. With no programmatic access to resource IDs, and no sensible URL naming scheme for resources, I saw this as being 'nice, but...'</p>

<p>However, it struck me that the horrible list of page links shown in the screenshot above could be easily scraped and used to see a simple database/array that could return the URL for the <em>n</em>'th page in a unit (cf. the <em>n</em>'th item in a feed).</p>

<p>So here's a demo - it only works for T180_8 at the moment:</p>

<p>- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8">Course index page: http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8</a><br />
- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=4">Unit resource page: http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=4</a><br />
- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=all">All resource pages for a unit: http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=all</a></p>

<p>The service root is at: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php</em><br />
The service arguments are: <em>cid</em> - course identifier; <em>item</em> - the number of the resource item required (<em>all</em> returns a list of all the resources, omitting the argument (or setting it to 0) returns the URL for the course index page).</p>

<p>I will probably XMLify this service and produce an HTML link output at some point...</p>

<p>When I get a chance, I'll revamp the openlearn2rss stylesheet to add these links in as item links; (which means I should then regenerate all the courses I did <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">yesterday</a> - sigh...)</p>

<p>PS I've just added another switch to the URL, the optional <em>&op=redirect</em>. Using this switch will redirect to the appropriate LabSpace page. For example:</p>

<p>- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&op=redirect">Course index page: http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&op=redirect</a><br />
- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=4&op=redirect">Unit resource page: http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/labspaceURL.php?cid=T180_8&item=4&op=redirect</a><br />

<p><s>(Okay then, some clues - the L course is French for Beginners, sort of; the B course is Marketing/Business; the S courses are on evolution, I think; the E courses are on the environment, maybe? The K course is something on healthcare, I think.)</s> - thanks for the titles above, Patrick;-)</p>

<p>Notes to self to post about another day:</p>

<p>- how to deal with crap (no other word for it) in the original XML; things like weird punctuation, or punctuation that has been encoded into something undecipherable. I think someone in the OpenLearn team needs to lock down exotic punctuation. The simple stylesheet I'm using gets confused by all but the simplest punctuation...</p>

<p>- some of the courses have no metadata at all, not even course title, which is (IMHO ;-) inexcusable.</p>

<p>- some of the courses may not always work sensibly as a feed using my literal "1 page=1 feed item" heuristic. For example, in the feedcycle regime, where a new item is delivered every day, the flow from one item into the next may break if the content has been chunked (paginated) so that one page sets up, and leads immediately into, the next.</p>

<p>- rather than make life easy using multimedia formats that everyone has their browser (and server) set up for, a lot of the multimedia resources I came across tonight use things like <em>flv</em> and <em>mp4</em> (rather than <em>swf</em> or <em>mpg</em>, for example). This led to an interesting diversion into potential embedded players (like this <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Video_Player">http://www.jeroenwijering.com/flv Flash video player</a>).</p>

<p>Although I'm sure a lot of OpenLearn/LabSpace decisions were taken for good reasons, it's obvious that no-one was really encouraged to play with (i.e. try to (re)use/(re)mix) any of this stuff at a file-format and document processing level while the architectural decisions were being made...</p>

<p>I'd said that was a big oops...</p>

<p>PS if anyone from the OpenLearn team is listening, am I allowed to put the movies etc. onto YouTube (from where it'll be easy to play with? ;-)</p>

<p>Couldn't resist - from the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4od/">Channel 4 <em>4oD</em></a> site, which will allow users to download, on demand, a wide variety of <a href="http://www.channel4.com">Channel 4</a> content:</p>

<blockquote>Will you offer 4oD for the Macintosh?

<p>Category: 4oD | Sub Category: Getting Started<br />
Unfortunately not at the launch of 4oD.</p>

<p>This is an industry-wide issue caused because the accepted Digital Rights Management (DRM) system used to protect online video content, which is required by our content owners, is not compatible with Apple Mac hardware and software. The closed DRM system used by Apple is not currently available for licence by third parties and there is no other Mac-compatible DRM solution which meets the protection requirements of content owners. Unfortunately, we are therefore unable to offer 4oD content to Mac users at this stage.</blockquote></p>

<p>Good old Apple... content rights are sorted (in this case, at least... and yes, I know that's a simplistic view...)  - now the problem's with the technology platform. I guess what Apple really want is stuff to go through iTunes, for a fee*, so that they can topslice. </p>

<p>Know what - I was gonna treat myself to Mac Mini for use as a home entertainment hub. Maybe a PC would be better...?</p>

<p>PS and what is it with the BBC and RealPlayer..........?</p>

<p>* To clarify that point, the 4oD service is primarily pay-to-play (any number of times during the 48 hr rental period, although I think some content has an outright purchase option...)</p>

<p>... is to find a way of using the lazyweb effectively to get all those OpenLearn tools I really want to play with built quickly...</p>

<p>For starters:</p>

<ul><li>an <strong>RSS2wikitext converter</strong>, that will allow me to use webfeeds to seed a set of wiki pages; one feed item per page, all automatically linked; the first use case I have is to import some RSSified OpenLearn content into a wiki, of course ;-) The current OpenLearn/LabSpace remix strategies are <em>not for the public</em> - it'd be interesting to see what level of engagement/maintenance/updating of the content we could achieve if the content was wikified rather than moodled...</li>
<li><strong>OpenLearn content tagging</strong>: <em>obviously...</em></li></ul>

<p>Comments I've had back to date on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008866.html">OpenLearn Daily Learning Chunks via RSS</a> demo have been really encouraging so far, as well as constructive (e.g. Google Reader gets a bit confused with some of the styling and new feed items are delivered in 24 hour cycles rather than at midnight of the next day, for example).</p>

<p>If anyone else has any thoughts on the feedcycle approach to course delivery, please let me know...</p>
