<p>Reading the feed from <a href="http://blog.newport.ac.uk/blogs/michael/default.aspx">Michael Webb's Blog</a> yesterday, I was.... stunned is probably the best word, to read his post "<a href="http://blog.newport.ac.uk/blogs/michael/archive/2008/07/09/52948.aspx">Newspace - a  social networking site for new students</a>" which describes "a social networking site for new students at the University, <a href="http://newstudents.newport.ac.uk/">http://newstudents.newport.ac.uk</a>." And why was I shocked? "It's based on <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>..." (a site we've also used as an online social network complement to our two recent <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/socialearn/">SocialLearn</a> workshops).</p>

<p><a href="http://newstudents.newport.ac.uk/" title="Newspace - Ning social network for Newport students"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2315/2658584500_aa2eaba6e0.jpg" alt="http://newstudents.newport.ac.uk/ Newport newspace social student site http://newstudents.newport.ac.uk/" height="342" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(The actual NIng site is here: <a href="http://newportstudents.ning.com/">http://newportstudents.ning.com/</a>.) Michael's post describes some of the issues relating to the decision to use Ning, and is well worth a read...</p>

<p>Having dutifully emailed(?) the SocialLearn team to give them a heads up about this site, I got a "yeah, it's happening all over the place" reply back that linked to a site the University of Bradfrod have also set up on NIng: <a href="http://developme.ning.com/">Develop Me! (University of Bradfrod on Ning)</a>. This social network appears to offer the "Meet and chat online" bit of a wider project hosted on the University of Bradford website itself: <a href="http://www.brad.ac.uk/developme/">Develop Me! homepage</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.brad.ac.uk/developme/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3047/2657775735_6c97143c94.jpg" alt="2008-07-11_1340" height="396" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the Bradford site on Ning:</p>

<p><a href="http://developme.ning.com/" title="Unoversity of Bradford 'Develop Me' social netowrk on Ning"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2657778499_6ebf4725be.jpg" alt="http://developme.ning.com/" height="337" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>It's interesting how the openness of the front page of this site compares with what happens if you try to go straight to the Newport Ning site...</p>

<p>So with some institutions feeling adventurous and taking the plunge into the world of social web apps, whilst maintaining some element of control, how will SocialLearn fit into all this? Like this maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/socialearn/" title="Locating SocialLearn"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2323/2658645524_4c9ce2fb9b.jpg" alt="Scoping socialearn" height="155" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>That is, maybe SocialLearn could become a <em>trusted</em> gateway to the world of social networks that institutions are more likely to trust than sites like Ning? By providing an open API and clear security model, it may also provide a platform within which insitutions can develop their own social applications or expose their own data to their own students in a social context? In developing a trusted pltform though, a lot would ride on the structure of the governance model, which is still unclear (at the moment, it's being run within the OU, using external developers, as an OU strategic development project).</p>

<p>PS Just trying to find my first mention of Ning on OUseful.info, I cam across this post from over two years ago now about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html"><em>ad hoc</em> learning environments</a>. Reading back over it, i wish I'd worked some of the ideas through more clearly, because they could well have fed into SocialLearn discussions over the last year...</p>

<p>PPS As well as Ning, let's not forget sites like UK based <a href="http://www.webjam.com/webjam/home">Webjam</a>, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/webjam-secures-further-19m-for-branded-communities/">apparently</a> received funding this week to help roll out its white label social network service...<br />

<h3 class="title">Leaky Students and Semi-Permeable Course Boundaries - The Social Life of OU Course Codes</h3>

<!--
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've started thinking about the "social life of URL's" and by extension the "social life of OU course codes". A couple of things have also prompted me to look again at social bookmarking (OUseful.info was heavily dominatd by social bookmarking issues in it's early days!) - one was an internal email, another was AlanC's <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2008/05/introducing-students-to-social.html">Introducing students to social bookmarking</a>.</p>

<p>Although many insitutional learnig environments are built on the assumption that we need a private place for students in the same cohort to work together out of the gaze of the public eye, the rise of social sharing sites means that course activity is starting to leak onto the public web...</p>

<p>In Facebook, there are now several dozen OU course related groups (set up by students themselves) and keyed by OU course code, as well as society groups, regional groups and so on:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2485344515/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/2485344515_3965302f64.jpg" alt="OU groups on facebook" height="437" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I've mentioned many times that OU course codes are incredibly valuable to us in a loosely coupled world (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010591.html">OU Course Codes - A Web 2.OU Crown Jewel</a>) so I've been wondering about the extent to which course codes are being used as tags for resources related to partciular courses. (Speaking personally, whenever I bookmark resources that I think may be relevant to a course I'm familiar with, I tag the resource with the appropriate course code).</p>

<p>And indeed, a quick look on delicious turned up several courses where students(?) have been bookmarking resources...</p>

<p>So it seemed to me, could we find some value from the public social networks building up around course codes, or add value back to the social sites with 'course hubs', using bookmarklets or browser extensions?</p>

<p>For example, if we have a course code, then we can maybe display a panel that links to a course description, or other course resources (such as derived OpenLearn resources)? In the simplest case, something like this maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/b201" title="B201 on delicious"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2045/2485353453_0049667f48.jpg" alt="course info on delicious" height="374" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>[The bookmarklet is still under dev - I'll post it when it's stable! The course title is pulled in via JSON from a Yahoo pipe that callers a Dapper screen scraper. The screenscraper scrapes the OU courses and quals page for the corresponding course. Unfortunately, the structural markup used on the courses and quals page is not as friendly as it might be, so for some courses the scraping doesn't manage to pull out e.g. the course description. I can see no good reason why we can't make courses and quals pages easily scrapeable, e.g. by defining a lite microformat to mark up course info, or expose course info by a lite, RESTful API (there is a prototype XCRI service, but it's too heavy...); so of course, we don't make that info readily available in that way... I;d suggest it on the Ideascale, but no-one would grok why I'd made the suggestion... which is maybe part of the problem...?]</p>

<p>Looking around some of the other courses on delicious, it's maybe not surprising that the the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography</a> course gets a double exposure on both delicious and flickr:</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/t189" title="T189 on delicious"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2485326047_fb0879ea62.jpg" alt="delicious course ad" height="317" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So how else can we use this info? One way might  be to build up social networks in public around course code tags, a bit like the way we built a course actions and study buddy finding service around course codes in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012552.html">Course Profiles Facebook application</a>.</p>

<p>But how ethical would it be to mine people's (peoples'?? anyone see the Apprentice episode with the special occasion cards?! ;-) affiliation with OU course codes - as hinted at by their use of course code tags on public, social content sharing websites, and display that emergent, discovered network via the use of bookmarklets or browser extensions?</p>

<p>In one of those 'in the air' type moments (if it's coffee time, check out <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell">Gladwell on "simultaneous discovery"</a>...), a just posted post by Alan again on <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2008/05/research-ethics-in-myspace-era.html">Research Ethics in the MySpace Era</a> raises some issues I <em>hadn't</em> thought about whilst tinkering with the above...<br />
<blockquote>A better analogy for research on social networking Web sites would be research on newspaper personal ads. Similar to a MySpace profile, the information is intended to be available to the public and invites correspondence. Both the personal ad and a MySpace profile may contain very personal and intimate information, but this information has been selected by its owner to be published in a public forum. The "subjects" might claim that they did not intend for the information to be used for research purposes, but they could not plausibly claim that the information was private.</blockquote></p>

<p>One to ponder, maybe?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/courseprofiles" rel="tag">courseprofiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20delicious" rel="tag"> delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/coursecode" rel="tag">coursecode</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20social%20life" rel="tag"> social life</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Over the weekend, I was pondering the issue of authentication, and how we might be able to expose course profiles badges (from the OU Course profiles Facebook app) in a widget on a public page.</p>

<p>At the moment, course listings for your own courses, and those of other people who have installed the application can be seen on a user's profile page (in cut down form) or on an 'all my courses page'; the intention is that these details can only be seen when you are logged in to Facebook.</p>

<p>(Sort of... Also over the weekend, I spotted an authentication snafu on Course Profiles that has a similar effect to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013899.html">Library onesearch authentication issue</a> - for example, I can log out of Facebook and still look up the courses that other other people have declared as public (albeit presumably on the assumption that means public with in Facebook... or maybe not?) if I know their id number (or guess at a valid one); which is unlikely; but is an outside possibility... That's being fixed at the mo, and as with the library oops, only affects particular instances of browsers that aren't closed after a browsing session on e.g. public access machines.)<br />
   <br />
The question with widget access that comes to my mind is: how can we best make course listing information available for an individual under user, via a widget, according to user privacy control settings?</p>

<p>There are a couple of examples I can think of:</p>

<p>1) the user wants the widget on a display surface behind some authentication layer on an arbitrary computer - e.g. as a widget on a private Netvibes, Pageflakes or Google personal page; in this case, only the user will see the contents of the widget. The user might be able to provide saved authentication details (ideally something like OpenId, though I could imagine this being locally saved Facebook login details; e.g. <a href="http://dev.netvibes.com/doc/howto/authentication">authentication for Netvibes widgets</a>);</p>

<p>2) the user wants to be able to see the widget wherever on their everyday machine in their everyday browser. By using an iframe within the widget, it may be possible to rely on a local cookie to okay the release of info through the widget; this is making a feature out of a weak security policy, but it does mean you are exposed if you use a public access machine and leave one of your cookies on it;</p>

<p>3) the user is happy for anybody to be able to see their information. In this case, all that's required is a user ID number, and a call to a service that returns course listings for that ID if the privacy permissions are set appropriately.</p>

<p>For course profiles information, then approach 3 (subject to user controls) would seem the simplest way forward.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/courseprofiles" rel="tag">courseprofiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20fb" rel="tag"> fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20widget" rel="tag"> widget</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>When we released the first OU Facebook application - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012552.html">Course Profiles</a> - we built it around several core principles:<br />
<ol><li>it should be useful as a personal application;</li><li>it should be increasingly useful as a social application as the installed user base increased;</li><li>it should encourage social sharing ("virality");</li><li>it should be respectful of users' privacy concerns.<br />
</li></ol>One thing we did not design into Course Profiles was a reason for users to visit it on a regular basis. Once courses are added to your profile, you only need to revisit the app to change their status (e.g. change a course from being currently studied to previously studied [note to self - the application could manage this transition itself if it knew the course start and end dates?]). The Study Buddy feature is another 'occasional visit' feature&nbsp; - that is, finding a study buddy for a course is not necessarily something you want to try to do again and again on a regular basis; even monitoring which friends have declared a course that you have declared is not a feature that makes Course Profiles sticky. The commenting feature might provide a reason for regularly checking the app, but commenting has not really taken off; a much needed redesign of the interface, surfacing some of the functionality hidden in the course actions panel, might improve uptake of the course comments facility, but whilst it's something we have had on the cards for a long time, we haven't pursued it.</p>

<p>Today, we're announcing our second OU Facebook application: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=11926232497">My OU Story</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the application has been designed with the four key principles identified above, as well as another two:<br />
<ul><li>the application should be compatible with Course Profiles;</li><li>the application should encourage users to visit it regularly.<br />
</li></ul>So what exactly is My OU Story? In short, it's an application that allows you to write short posts about particular courses, associate your mood with those posts, and receive supportive feedback from your friends about those posts. A "Mood graph" provides a summary view of your mood over time. A river of news provides a snapshot view of stories that have been posted by other application users, and makes it easy for you to send them supportive comments in return.</p>

<p>The My OU Story app has been put together by the same team that developed Course Profiles (with some additional creative input in the original creative meeting by Ian Roddis [who blogs where???;-)] - Liam has the low down, in part, about the process we went through creating the app.: <a href="http://www.greenhughes.com/content/new-facebook-application-my-ou-story">New Facebook application: My OU Story</a></p>

<p>As a bit of a tease, here's Stuart's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATHksF4YJrE">My OU Story screencast</a> - I'll post in a little more detail about various aspects of the app over the next week or two. </p>

<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" height="350" width="425"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ATHksF4YJrE" wmode="transparent" quality="high" menu="false" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></object><br />
   <br />
As for our aspirations for this app? Well, we'd like to think that it's exploring one possible mechanism for encouraging peer support, though the ability to offer supportive comments/messages to someone who's maybe signaled they're having a hard time on a course; or alternatively, share their success with a congratulatory comment when they're particularly happy with something they've achieved on a course.</p>

<p>If used regularly, correlating mood graphs across users on a course might turn up insights regarding the pacing or difficulty of a course. A couple of things I'm looking out for are 'nodal mood points', where everybody's mood appears to be in synch, (for example, a particularly difficult part of the course might correspond to large numbers of students struggling with a course and finding it hard going), and the distribution of emotional states around assessment time.</p>

<p>It is well known that Google Trends has predictive potential (for example, look at the trend for this search on <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=roses">roses</a>;-), and whilst Google has orders of magnitude more users than we can ever expect for My OU Story, there is an outside possibility that aggregated mood statuses might be predictive of things like assessment dates. (How useful that would be, I'm not sure.... but it might illuminate how far in advance of an assessment students' mood starts to be affected by the impending deadline.)<br />
PS while we're being all emotional, this post by chance shows how emotional status indicators are starting to appear on user feedback forms: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/good_ui_design_make_it_easy_show_me_you_care.php">Good UI Design: Make It Easy, Show Me You Care</a><div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fb" rel="tag">fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20my%20ou%20stroy" rel="tag"> my ou stroy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20course%20profiles" rel="tag"> course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Great news today, from a notice Kate spotted on OU Student Home (and that Liam twittered about last week - internal readers can find it here: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/documents/5/kj081503091445840.pdf">Studying at the Open University with an Apple Mac computer</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Studying at the Open University with an Apple Mac computer<br />
March 2008 </p>

<p>This document describes the current situation at the Open University (OU) for students who use Apple Macintosh computers. </p>

<p>Open University students use a range of printed materials, CDs, DVDs and online resources. In February 2007 the University launched a new virtual learning environment (VLE), providing increasing amounts of this learning content via the Web, and giving access to dynamic information such as assignment results. Online content is currently tested with the following browsers: Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7, and Mozilla Firefox. In addition, the University is considering testing web content on the Mac-based Safari platform.&nbsp; In the meantime, Mac users can access the VLE by downloading and installing Mozilla Firefox, version 2 or higher. <br />
...<br />
The policy of authoring for Windows machines was decided at a time when most courses used fixed media rather than the Internet and less than 3% of the public (and OU students) were using Macs.  It was not possible to justify the costs of developing and supporting cross-platform fixed media products.  Most new DVDs for OU courses are however being produced using a browser-based interface which means they will run on Macs as well as PCs.<br />
...<br />
The University is currently carrying out its own audit of course materials to check Mac compatibility, and is examining ways to provide access for both Mac users and users of other platforms such as Linux.</blockquote><br />
So  - Firefox has traction (it's also included on the Online Apps DVD that goes out to students each year). I'd personally try to push Flock, but I guess Firefox is a start... ;-)</p>

<p>Also in my feeds today, a press announcement that proudly declares <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=13268">Open University students trial interactive screen experiments</a> (Stuart has denied this was his press release... but maybe that was <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=156">just an excuse...</a>? LOL;-):<br />
<blockquote>An innovative new kind of physics experiment is being introduced for science students on Open University courses this year. Interactive screen experiments (ISEs) use Flash technology to allow students to carry out a real experiment using a standard home computer and web browser.</blockquote>This is a neat idea, and looks to complement some of the remote internet lab work KMi et al. did several years ago, but... (there's always a but, when you look at the detail...)... chasing the story a little, it looks as if the apps are being developed in <em>Shockwave, not Flash</em>.<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/activities/details/detail.php?itemId=4612203073f3a">Developing interactive screen-based versions of real physics experiments using Shockwave movies</a></p>

<p>An interactive screen experiment (ISE) is a highly interactive Shockwave movie that runs entirely under user control by clicking and dragging on the knobs and buttons on the experimental equipment.  The movie comprises hundreds or thousands of image frames recording every state of the equipment.  <strong>The movie can be played in an ordinary web browser with a free Shockwave plug-in.  Shockwave is widely used for the web delivery of movies and is highly suited for interactive control (it is used in the production of computer video games). </strong> When the student runs an ISE the effect is very similar to a running a remote-control experiment. The difference for the laboratory provider is that there is no limit to the number of students who may simultaneously run the experiment and the real equipment itself is used only once. [My emphasis]</blockquote>This doesn't make much difference for <em>Windows</em> users, (except for the need to download an extra plugin), but... err...: may I refer the interested reader to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/">http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/</a> (non-Windows PC is typically the definition of a non-standard/alternate/alternative platform; that said, I think that for some apps, Windows Vista is also classed this way;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2343112220/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2343112220_dbaf68f492.jpg" alt="Shickwave compatability" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="312" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(Contemporary Macs are Intel, not Power PC, Macs...)</p>

<p>[UPDATE: Shockwave does now work on Intel Macs...]</p>

<p>So if you have a recent Mac, or run Linux, maybe even Vista, then as far as the ISEs would appear to go, err, hmmm... well, you can still get the text content from Moodle :-)</p>

<p>PS I'll be happy when I can view everything through my Wii browser ;-)</p>

<p>It seems I'm supposed to be giving a talk on mashups next week, so I'm going to start trying to put a listing of some of the mashups I've cobbled together in a single location, probably as a tab on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful Dashboard</a>. (At the moment, I'm working on pulling landing pages for maps mashups together: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/maps/">OUseful Map Mashups, Geo Tools and Map Utilities</a>)</p>

<p>For anyone who's in MK, err, next Thursday, here's the meeting announcement:<br />
<blockquote><em>The March EATING talk will take place next week on Thursday 20 March at 2.30 p.m. in the ICT Library (Venables N1015). Please do come along to it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tony Hirst - Mashup madness 101 - getting started with web mashups</strong></p>

<p>If you've heard of 'web mashups', but don't know what they are, exactly...</p>

<p>...or if you have an idea of what they are, but don't know how to get started creating your own web mashups...</p>

<p>...then this EATING meeting might be just what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Starting off with a quick tour of just what constitutes a web mashup, from Nestoria housing maps to feedlearner.com, we'll move on to tinkering with the quick-to-get started Yahoo Pipes mashup tool, before looking at how web APIs are opening up the possibility for production strength mashups using third party web services.</p>

<p>The session will be run in part as a partial attention format workshop, so feel free to bring a wireless laptop along so you can join in the fun. If the hands-on approach doesn't appeal, come along anyway - the meeting will double up as a trad, "talk from the front and read from the projector screen" seminar too...</blockquote></p>

<p>I'll also be doing a couple of papers at the OU Making Conenctions/Curriculum conf (unless I can someone else to do them;-) MK, 29th-30th April:</p>

<p>Here are the abstracts before I lose them:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Course Analytics - Using Google Analytics to Understand Student Behaviour in an Online Course</strong>

<p>Academic Analytics "describes how data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling". Academic Analytics can be used to predict student success, as well as retention, and are the likely focus of the Moodle/VLE activity stats module.</p>

<p>In contrast to indvidual student tracking using academic analytics approaches, course analytics describes an approach whereby an off the shelf web stats analytics tool such as Google Analytics is used to better understand aggregated student behaviour in an online course. By treating the online course materials as 'just another website', powerful reporting techniques developed for use in commercial websites can be used to analyse the effectiveness of the website, as a website,  in terms of measuring stuedent progress through, and engagement with, the online materials.</p>

<p>Using the 2007J presentation of the online Relevant Knowladge course T184 as an example, I will show what sorts of reporting is possible using Google Analytics and discuss how it can be used to inform the design of our online courses.</p>

<p><em>Quality eLearning strand</em></blockquote></p>

<blockquote><strong>Do You Wanna Be My Study Buddy? The OU Course Profiles Facebook Application</strong>

<p>Many OU conference moderators know that many of our students proudly state the course codes of courses they have taken, are taking and intend to take in the signature area of their First Class conference postings. Drawing on this observation, a Facebook application was developed that allowed students to add a list of OU course codes to their Facebook profile page.</p>

<p>Since its launch in October 2008, the OU Course Profiles application has now (March 2008) grown to embrace over 4,250 users.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we will describe Course Profiles, showing how it can be used to help users find study buddies on their course, as well as encouraging them to try out taster material for courses they are considering studying via OpenLearn.</p>

<p>User data allows us to monitor which courses have a particularly high level of activity within the application. By identifying clusters of courses that have been taken by students who have installed the application, we have been able to provide a 'people who studied this course also studied that course' style recommendation service.</p>

<p>As ever more people participate in online social networks, the Course Profiles application allows us to explore non-intrusive ways of engaging with the student body in the places where they choose to go (e.g. Facebook), as well as developing a better understanding of how social network approaches might be used to enhance the student experience and sense of community within OU hosted online environments.  </p>

<p><em>Changing student experience strand</em></blockquote></p>

<p><br />
ps I think I was trying to sort out an ALT w/s, too - oops - better brave my email box, gulp....</p>

<p>pps I'm starting to think we should open source the course profiles fb app code - if we did, would anyone out there want to run with it?<br />

<h3 class="title">OU VLE Update - VLE version 2</h3>

I went to an update session on the latest OU VLE release earlier this week, and whilst I have to admit to having certain "issues" (?!) with the Moodle/VLE approach, there were a couple of announcements that look really promising......
<!--
<p>I went to an update session on the <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=55">latest OU VLE release</a> earlier this week, and whilst I have to admit to having certain "<a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=45">issues</a>" (?!) with the Moodle/VLE approach, there were a couple of announcements that look really promising...</p>

<p>I wandered in to the session a few minutes late, so missed the opening bravado, but did manage to see presentations about each of the tools now being - or soon to be - offered within the OU VLE.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the development phase of the VLE will continue to run until July 2008, and then move into a proper roll-out phase (less development, more evangelism to course teams, producing courses with the VLE in mind, and so on).</p>

<p>I'm not sure how agile the development process was (changing the spec as development went along, in consultation with course teams, ALs, students and web stats reports...) nor whether there will be developer effort available to 'tune' the various VLE modules after July as we gain experience in using them for real. My assumption would be that the powers that be will see the VLE as a done deal, rather than a living platform that could, should?, evolve with use - and continued developer involvement - but then, traditional software engineering/project management processes have a lot to answer for...</p>

<p>Anywhere, here's a quick run down of what was reported on the day. (If you are OU staff, you can <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=1&amp;whichevent=1103">watch a recording of the event via the Berrill stadium</a>, and/or find more detail about the program on the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouvle">OU VLE minisite</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrated Online Experience/Student User Experience</span><br />
There are currently several different interfaces presented to students, in particular Student Home (which sites outside Moodle?) and the course websites in the VLE. In particular, the VLE has a different look and feel to Student Home, and no obvious return path to there, even though that is a natural entry point to a course website.</p>

<p>Students want single portal  (allegedly...;-), want to feel part of a community, want timely info, and so on.</p>

<p>A new top level navigation scheme was released in January:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2218665350_ab746f03b3.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="39" width="500" /></p>

<p>The Student Home message board now incorporates course news. (I'm not sure how this is handled (I'd have the message board as an RSS feed display and then pipe news to it via aggregated RSS feeds, but I expect it's way more clunky than that (I would so love to be proved wrong...;-)</p>

<p>For July, there will be a redesign of interfaces to provide a consistent user experience, along with some community feature (an "OU Life" tab). (The Course Profiles Facebook app provides quite a few social features, but letting students make friends with each other through Student Home is probably a bit too radical?;-)<br style="font-weight: bold;" /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Federated search</span><br />
Currently - the OU search page will search over course materials, C&amp;Q etc (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009229.html">New OU Search Tools</a>, though that's maybe dated now?) Moodle course pages are now included in results when a search is made over course materials (not sure how the permissions work here? Can you only see into course materials on courses you are registered on? On courses you have taken? etc etc). On the student view there will be an option to search over the course materials for your course. (I'd like to see a custom search engine for each course too that searches over things that are linked to from the course...)</p>

<p>Library search will be available from the federated search page next week, covering online subscriptions, repositories etc.; there will be guest access for the public, to act as a taster of online Library service provision for potential students; Library search will be added to the intranet search in near future. Clicking through on results e.g. for an ejournal article, will go via a link resolver direct to the article.</p>

<p>By July 08 - federated search team will explore the inclusion of blogs, wikis, forums, internet, mystuff (?how will they index mystuff?); save and tag search results in Mystuff (?saved searches? or save/tag individual search results?)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobile Learner Support</span><br />
Recognition that mobility increasingly requires device independence delivery, and that it is the learner who is mobile.</p>

<p>I thought I heard Rhodri say that the OU is moving to a web spec rather than a computer spec (we currently 'require' students to have a windows machine, for example, rather than saying they should be able to run IE67, Firefox 2, Opera or Safari, for example, with at least Flash 8 (or whatever) installed).</p>

<p>Project has been considering different classes of devices/behaviours - mobiles, smartphones, tablets etc. AACS have apparently got a mobile demonstrator (?url )</p>

<p>A Mobile "channel" is being explored - e.g. to include podcasting; there is a limited Moodle ipodcast module under development, though we still need to find a way of embedding e.g. transcript support, possibly using e.g. lyric support. Small scale trials from end of February.</p>

<p>Mobile collaboration being explored - presences/status/IM; (rich) media capture, sharing; location based/GPS etc.</p>

<p>Support for students who are mobile e.g. between locations, or where connectivity is an issue - offline moodle/Moodle on a stick; local version of content, forum synch.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendars</span><br />
Calendar items have a check box, so student can mark off what they have done (?use for to do lists?); calendar supports linking.</p>

<p>Assessment details block - displays assessment dates, and highlights next assessment. [??should this display result of completed assessment?? - is the assessment date stuff available as a service/RSS feed?]</p>

<p>There is a combined calendar view, for students with several courses. (??Should students be able to move 'fluid' elements, cf. fixed assessment elements? e.g could we not let students rearrange certain parts of their calendar (include a 'reset to OU recommended schedule' option?).</p>

<p>A personal calendar page is now available (but does it offer synch via iCal etc? If not, then it limits its usefulness?)</p>

<p>Tutors an create group events for their tutor group; tutorial dates imported into calendar (are tutorial dates available as a web service/RSS feed?)</p>

<p>For the future - export (ah - ical?), automatic next presentation calendar creation (?just need a 'relative dates' calendar representation and then set the start date, surely??); student led calendar creation (e.g. student has a window for study, and needs to pace their study within that window - ??cf. possible intermediate state of student rearranging fixed presentation calendar pondered above?).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions</span><br />
Giles - (copublishing) - how does OU VLE compare with the way that commercial systems have evolved?<br />
NS - our Moodle VLE provides us with flexibility cf. e.g. Blackboard; hasn't been keeping g up with commercial providers' offerings.<br />
DK: we are monitoring, e.g. keeping an eye on Pearson/eCollege etc<br />
OU is taking a system wide view of VLE development - ECAs, ETMAs, structured authoring, synchronous comms, etc.</p>

<p>Comment: usability poor on some futures; e.g. setting up tutor groups on Moodle, <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span> course managers need to produce pages of instructions about how to do it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eAssessment</span><br />
Okay - so I admit it, I was quite impressed by some of the eAssessment tools (which are being used in presentation, SDK125) [internal link: <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/site/icma">eAssessment site</a>]</p>

<p>Gradebook/Tutor view - of student progress; at a glance view of each student's CMA progress to date.</p>

<p>[Qn at end, Karen Kear: privacy issues wrt e.g. student tracking, peering at student's computer based assessment<br />
??should student be allowed to declare who they want to see their assessment answers?<br />
Student profile - maybe provide student privacy opt-in/out e.g. wrt tracking and sharing of tracked info?<br />
CT can make progress data private so ALs can't see it (but students can't exert the same control over their own data??)]</p>

<p>CMA - can you go back and edit answers before final submission; what counts as final submission?<br />
Tutor has access to the feedback report for each student on each ECMA (??privacy).</p>

<p>??Are the student result tables sortable? Easy to do with <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012562.html">YUI data table</a>...and I seem to remember LTS saying there were going to use YUI?</p>

<p>Openmark questions (?not for assessment?) can be embedded in the Moodle course materials (for a quick overview of Openmark - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010513.html">Openmark Computer-Assisted Assessment Tool</a>). OpenMark (almost - ready by March) integrated with the Moodle eAssessment  module - so you use both Moodle eAssessment questions and OpenMark questions in the same assessment :-)</p>

<p>eAssessment project team are looking for a course to use Moodle assessment for credit - T151 would be a good candidate I think, offering a 10 week trial in 2008J?? but we'd need to start now-ish??</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tools</span><br />
Pilot course for ALs over 3 weeks last year, evaluated by IET - forum, blog, wiki, quiz.</p>

<p>New blog module; wiki reports of user activity/participation (??interesting to see screen shots?); forum load testing,<br />
OU wiki (can be locked down before, after, before/after particular dates; RSS feeds of changes; add comments to individual pages;); audio recording tool (simple, stripped down); vote module (in testing; multiple questions, different chart options (what chart generator are they using?); different answer types)<br />
Replacement for Lyceum; tendering exercise - none of open source solutions met needs; list of 3 bidding in tender process, [CONFIDENTIAL] will be adopted, subject to contract.<br />
Pilots - MSG (3 courses from May 2008), Vote module, [Lyceum replacement]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mathematical and Scientific Content/Notation</span> (from April)<br />
Two areas  - display and input</p>

<p>Currently  - pdf , or embedded image (poor on accessibility, screen reader support etc).<br />
MathML is preferred option, e.g. is executable (plottable, for exampe) ??url for demo of plotting equation&nbsp; from MathML?<br />
Currently okay for IE, Firefox but not Moodle in FF...<br />
"About" - Can get MathML, TeX view of equation; preferences to set display as MathML with plugin, as image, with link back to the "About" page. <br />
Next step - student Maths editor.<br />
Currently - support TeX input (?); want: visual editor, simpler text input syntax; informal handwritten maths input.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Student Tracking and Reporting</span><br />
How better understand what happens in VLE/better serve students (cf. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=%22course%20analytics%2C%20part%22">course analytics</a>)<br />
Moodle recording and reporting.<br />
Develop reporting system, with many views:<br />
- VCE dashboard<br />
- document download reports</p>

<p>Student tracking - doc in preparation; <br />
Milestone tracking (???maybe this relates to learning design????)<br />
Export data at completion date[????] - tutor group view, potential VOICE integration, course teams assessing entire student body.</p>

<p>???would a layered view of web analytics/student course tracking be useful?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MyStuff</span><br />
<a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/portfolio">OU ePortfolio</a> - can be accessed by all using OUCU and OU pwd<br />
New design - spaces, tags, compilations, items, sharing, pinboard.</p>

<p>[I will do a write up in next few weeks...]</p>

<p>Spaces - programmes or CT can provide course related views (who sets spaces up??)<br />
Resource view over content from course - but how does this reconcile with stuff in Moodle? [ ??how does mystuff related to studenthome????? Danger here of providing yet another inconsistent interface, cf. unified student experience project. What's the betting that unified experience team looked at legacy tools, and none of the stuff yet to come on stream, like Mystuff? Silos&nbsp; - that's what we want... (and loosely coupled does not necessarily imply siloed at the user experience level IF your design team is working effectively... ;-)</p>

<p>Compilations - ?compilation is a web page editor? store notes from 3rd party website?? cf. google notebook. Heh heh - so there's no reason from a copyright point of view about recommending Zotero, or Firefox scrapbook plugin to students?</p>

<p>Emphasis at the moment is on stability...<br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2175522180_ed46616fd7.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="176" width="500" /><br />
Identify missing features for July 08 push; ??No mention of storage limits, export, integration with third party storage, integration with doc viewers (e.g. Zoho), embedding (e.g. Scribd, Slideshare) ;-)</p>

<p>Can MyStuff integrate with ETMA/ECA system?</p>

<p>Delay to PDP and About Me. Guidance written, with animations (where??)<br />
Uability/accessiblity testing over Feb, IET evaluation and case studies (do IET look at web analytics?? Or just single user ete tracking and small group questionnaires?)<br />
Desirable features e.g. better sharing (with tutor/tutor group).</p>

<p>Study spaces are for students to collect stuff. (do they link through to moodle view? where does back button go?<br />
Mystuff available from study support area (?but it does feel disolocated wrt integrated student experience). Save to Mystuff buttons a possibility in moodle envt.</p>

<p>??argument for providing multiple possible points of view and letting students/users find there way, then we support/imrpove that experience (build the path where people walk)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Structured Authoring tool</span><br />
<a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/site/savle">New features</a>- media file support (audio, video, flash), large images (thumbnail with link to full image), link handling, linked PDF (printable version), improved search</p>

<p>Improved tools for linking with a doc, with other VLE activities<br />
Improved numbering, internal sections for one page docs<br />
Search within doc, or cluster of docs, integration with federated search.<br />
Rights info, equation support (LaTeX, soon MathML); item ID, printable PDF, browser usage hints(??), better error handling in SA tool.<br />
Approx 200 people across OU using the tool (i.e. total failure in adoption? ;-)<br />
LTS support mechanisms - front line: media project manager; <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/lts/service-delivery">Service delivery team</a>; online services user group. </p>

<p>Qn: reconciliation between SA and VLE support for Maths; to paraphrase, "aware there may be an issue, working on it". Will be hooked in to SA process and when VLE support is made available.</p>

<p>Will SA support course productivity, e.g. rapid, integrated agile commenting, changes, etc.??<br />
Workflow appears to be linear flow rather than shared/collaborative docs? i.e. implemented OLD workflow model rather than a more agile, collaborative one. Ah well, what's email for if not to mail Word docs to groups of people and ask them to each mail separate annotated copies back round to everyone on the the doc circulation list...?!</p>

<p>No consideration yet of musical notation support (cf. MathML support)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlights</span><br />
The assessment block, and some of the approaches being used in Maths notation support.<br />
Unified student experience has something going for it, (maybe lots, depending on how they are moving info around in the backend?;-).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lowlights</span><br />
Strcutured authoring has issues in uptake and workflow. MyStuff is all over the place.<br />
Calendars and search look somehow lacking and uninspiring at the user-experience level??<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ouvle" rel="tag">ouvle</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/moodle" rel="tag">moodle</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>    For many years, I've known about <a href="http://universitybooksearch.co.uk/">University Book Search</a>,  a site for buying second hand copies of OU course materials and study packs rather more cheaply than you can get them for new on the <a href="http://www.ouw.co.uk/">OU Worldwide</a> site.&nbsp; (It costs more again to take the actual course, or course...)</p>

<p>One of the nice things about University Book Search is the way it uses OU course codes in page URLs to display second hand materials that are available for a particular course (for example, here's what's available for <a href="http://universitybooksearch.co.uk/search.asp?startsearch=TRUE&amp;Code=A103">A103</a>), and as we all know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010591.html">using OU course codes in URLs</a> is one of our web presence crown jewels.</p>

<p>But I'd never thought of looking to eBay as a source of old OU course materials, until a chance comment made at an OU awayday workshop about finding secondhand OU materials there...</p>

<p>So I had a quick peak to see what a <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/search/search.dll?satitle=open+university+course">search on eBay for <span style="font-style: italic;">open university course</span> </a>turned up, and it does indeed turn up quite a few old courses in the Educational/Textbooks area.</p>

<p>Methinks I need to go and have a look at the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/">eBay API</a>, and maybe see about listing second hand course units on the <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">Openlearnigg</a> course listings ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">Course Analytics - Prequel</a>, I made a first stab at distinguishing between <em>course analytics</em> and <em>Academic Analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Here's where my thinking's at now... (the terms are subject to change...)</p>

<p><em>eLearning analytics</em> is the collection, visualisation and interpretation of electronic data collected in the context of eLearning activity. <em>eLearning analytics</em> covers the analysis of data collected from two main sources:<br />
<ul><li><em>Academic (or Student) analytics</em>: "[the use of] data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) [that] can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling" (<a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB6101.pdf">EduCause report on Academic analytics</a>);</li><br />
<li><em>Course analytics</em>: the application of website analytics data collected from student use of online courses for the purposes of "optimising"  the design of online courses.</li></ul><br />
<em>eLearning analytics</em> are concerned with helping us understand the behaviour of <em>individual students</em> (academic/student analytics) and <em>individual courses</em> (course analytics).</p>

<p><em>eLearning analytics</em> are one particular class of <em>education analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some more <em>education analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Within an institution, the aggregate behaviour of individual students taking individual courses to complete a particular degree gives rise to <em>qualification analytics</em> (for example, <a href="http://csintra1.open.ac.uk/IETCoProf/CprRptSelect.asp">IET course stats</a> (internal OU users only). These stats describe user populations on individual courses, along with details of the other courses taken by students on a particular course.   To a certain extent, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook app</a> is allowing to informally collect approximations to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">this</a> <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011622.html">sort</a> of information.</p>

<p><em>Qualification analytics</em> may provide the basis of a course recommendation engine.</p>

<p><em>Curriculum analytics</em> refer to the curriculum design and are not really analytics (though they may be thought of almost as "offline" qualification analytics). A more appropriate phrase may be the curriculum graph (or qualification graph?) which underpins the qualification analytics. (What I'm struggling for here is a way to capture the sense of my earlier courses and quals visualisations (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010472.html">here&gt;</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010499.html">here&gt;</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010501.html">here&gt;</a> and<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010502.html">here&gt;</a>).</p>

<p><em>Qualification analytics</em> may also be collected at a national level, e.g. by agencies such as <a href="http://www.ucas.com/figures/index.html">UCAS</a>, and describe degree choice across UK HEIs year-on-year. These analytics may play a role in <em>planning statistics</em> used to predict course numbers on future courses.<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/analytics" rel="tag">analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20analytics" rel="tag">course analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20elearning%20analytics" rel="tag"> elearning analytics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>In the previous parts of this series (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">prequel</a>), I have looked at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010957.html">Visitor Behaviour</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010973.html">When Are Our Students Online?</a>. In this part, I shall briefly review user activity around assessment. The 10 week course is assessed by a short, multiple choice computer marked assessment 5 weeks in, and a more substantial written end-of-course assessment in the final week.</p>

<p>Measuring activity based on the number of pageviews, we see spikes in activity  - as indicated by pageviews - just prior to the two assessment deadlines (the assessment dates were midnight on Tuesday June 5th and midday on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2033964880/" title="CMA PageViews"></a>Tuesday July 10th).</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2117/1727702520_4a4d90c605.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="348" width="500" /></p>

<p>The Top Content Summary paints a similar picture:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2370/2033268923_74935c5833.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="229" width="500" /></p>

<p>The 'course assessment' page links to both the CAM and the ECA. Here's how students navigated to - and from - that page.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2026/2033161343_048231d86e.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p><br />
<h3>The CMA, deadline Tuesday June 5th</h3>If we define reports that display pageview activity for just the pages relating to the CMA, we see a peak in activity around the time of the CMA submission date&nbsp; -&nbsp; Tuesday June 5th - students are completing the assessment at the 'scheduled' time.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2074/2033964880_3068cca0eb.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="202" width="484" /></p>

<p>What is quite surprising is the short average time spent on page; it would be useful to be able to plot the actual distribution of time spent on this page to see whether there is a blip at longer durations.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2034072048_84f410aa43.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="179" width="500" /></p>

<p>It would also be useful to know how many people printed off this page.</p>

<p>A summary statistic identifies the pages from which the users directly reached the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/2033966336_0f0b1006fc.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="235" width="431" /></p>

<p>We see a high proportion coming from the Course Assessment page, as we might expect, but also from the front page and the course calendar, as well as the precursor teaching material (Lesson 4, Conclusion).</p>

<p>We can check the entrance to the CMA page from the Navigation Summary report, which also describes where users went after leaving the CMA page.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/2033162053_e8ce71f597.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="283" width="500" /></p>

<p>The high percentage of exits - people who left the site from this page - is worth noting. A quarter of students completed the assessment (or printed it off, maybe, and then left the site.</p>

<p>By setting the CMA page as a goal, it is possible to use Google Analytics to further break down the path users took to reach the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2016/2033966096_2deb6eaae7.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="370" width="500" /></p>

<p>The {entrance} denotes the point at which users entered the site. We see quite a high proportion of users entering the site and going directly to the CMA page (that is, not going via any teaching material pages).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2033161343/" title="Assessment Page Navigation Summary"></a><h3>The ECA, deadline Tuesday July 10th</h3>The same pattern of behaviour is observed for the end-of-course assesssment: there is a peak in activity (as measured by pageviews) in the few days leading up to the ECA cut-off date, around the time the ECA is scheduled in the course calendar:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2080/2033964656_46179d74c9.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="148" width="500" /></p>

<p>Looking at the daily breakdown of visits to the ECA page in the immediate run up to the ECA (the cut-off date was  midday on Tuesday July 10th), we see a peak of activity on the Sunday and Monday immediatley before the Tuesday cut-off. There also appears to be a significant amount of ECA related activity on the previous Sunday (July 1st).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2033968346_054ad3b608.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="289" width="500" /></p>

<p>Once again, the average time on page result does not appear to be that useful, although it may be possible to correlate or otherwise combine it with other, visitor data sets?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2217/2033162903_fcfb520fa3.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="262" width="500" /></p>

<p>The list of originating pages mirrors that found for the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2033163809_0cf3911663.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="244" width="410" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
The Navigation Summary breaks this down further, and again shows a high proportion of exits:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2033163299_58e177bf9a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p>By defining the ECA page as a Goal page, we can tunnel into the navigation path leading to the ECA page in a little more detail:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2120/2033163633_4ebdf3d81c.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="364" width="500" /></p>

<p>Once again, we see a short path between site entry and reaching the ECA page - students are coming to the site to specifically engage with the assessment material.</p>

<p><br />

<h3 class="title">Access Level Notebook is Not Up to OUr Spec...</h3>

<p>Marc has been raving over the last couple of days about the <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/11/08/the-truth-about-the-asus-eee-rm-minibook/">RM Asus miniBook</a> (<a href="http://www.rm.com/HE/Products/Product.asp?cref=PD1024415">product details</a>) a sub-200 quid notebook computer that runs Open Office and Skype, and has preloaded links to webmail sites, Google docs, Wikipedia and more.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/tech.shtm">OU Personal Computing Specification</a> requires students to have a Windows machine, which effectively means the Asus "Access level machine" is not an option for our students...</p>

<p>Also in the news is the recent announcement of <a href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/news/132308">fast growing Apple Mac computer sales</a>. I can see why this makes sense - after all, if the only apps you run are iTunes, chat, mail and Google (i.e. a browser), then why not opt for a Mac? What does Windows give you?</p>

<p>So is it time to call time of the <em>required</em> use of Windows machines? What are the barriers to platform independence for us?</p>

<p>One major issue for the OU in particular is that we ship quite a lot of software to students. Specifiying an operating system makes this easier to achieve (although in principle using Java should offer a degree of operating system independence; going forward, Silverlight and Adobe Air might also be interesting in this respect?)</p>

<p>Chatting to John Naughton last night, I asked about the history of the OU Personal Computing Specification/Requirement, hoping it had originally been defined at a functional level (unfortunately, it wasn't).</p>

<p>Maybe it's time for us to start thinking about what an appropriate functional specification should be (the listing on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007985.html">OLA DVD</a> could be a useful guide in this respect?)...</p>

<p>...and selecting software for future courses that are either platform independent  desktop apps, or that run from the cloud through a browser...</p>

<p>Now I wonder, is <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=43">Moodle on a Stick</a> tied to Windows?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/platformindependence" rel="tag">platformindependence</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20asus%20minibook" rel="tag"> asus minibook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/access" rel="tag">access</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>What beautifully sweet irony - Niall Sclater has just posted <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=45">Downside of the small pieces model</a> about SlideShare being down, and comments:<br />
<blockquote>Of course institutional sites go down too - but it's our business to keep them working and at least if services are hosted in-house we can pull out all the stops to ensure they're fully functional.</blockquote><br />
So I thought I'd log in to the intranet and build a quick scraper to alert me from a status page that I think exists on there somewhere about any OU server outages...</p>

<p>...only I can't get in...</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2089/1953693748_e6050f828a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="276" width="500" /></p>

<p>And I get the same error when I try to log in to my student page (must be an error with the SAMS single sign on  authentication system)?</p>

<p>Now this may or may not be a problem with my browser (Flock).... but how do I know? I'm using Flock successfully with a whole range of other websites at the moment - and my internet connection is fine... hmmm... [UPDATE: not a cookie problem - seems to be working now, an hour or so later... but I do notice the Bloglines plumber is out... Maybe there's a bug going around?!]</p>

<p>If it was SlidesShare, I'd mail the developers...with the OU - I guess I can try that <em>Email us</em> form, but I don't hold out much hope...</p>

<p>PS SlideShare seems to be back up now, anyway... :-)</p>

<!--
<p>Sarah Horrigan's <a href="http://kindalearning.blogspot.com/">Kinda Learning Stuff</a> has been kinda doing it for me over the last few weeks, and so I've <a href="http://edublogawards.com/2007/2007-nominations/">duly nominated</a> it....</p>

<p>Sarah's latest post - <a href="http://kindalearning.blogspot.com/2007/11/get-out-of-myspace.html">Get out of MySpace!</a> - picks up on something that keeps being restated (that students don't necessarily want their teaches invading their social spaces) with a bit of personal commentary:<br />
<blockquote>Although the idea of life-long learning is a laudable one, we all have different versions of ourselves which we reveal or hide according to our own choices. Sometimes we want to learn in public... sometimes we want to learn in private. It's up to us to invite people in to those private spaces - if we choose to. I'm not sure if there's an issue of respect for boundaries here or of complex power relationships which also need to be respected - but just saying 'because students like using this, they'll like using it to learn' doesn't logically follow.<br />
...<br />
I think that ownership and control over environment are important and there's something mildly uncomfortable about 'friends' from one context being introduced to 'friends' in another.</blockquote><br />
Observations like this,  of course, provide one of the drivers of the <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2007/05/04/groups-groupings-and-taming-my-buddy-list-and-twitter/">"groupings" meme</a>, which argues for social network management tools that support faceted personal profiles, as well as a <a href="http://www.lunchoverip.com/2007/02/lift07_stowe_bo.html">"me-first"</a> principle for <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/03/social_me_first.html">designing social tools</a> (how many Stowe Boyd coined terms did you spot in that sentence?).</p>

<p>One of the things we spent quite a bit of time discussing when we first came up with the idea of the Open University <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Course Profiles</a> Facebook application was the principle that we didn't want to force the application on to anyone; nor did we want to tie in to institutional student record systems and produce a 'formal' institutional application.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/1640855627_c17be99e67.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="258" width="500" /></p>

<p>The idea was simple - we would provide a tool that would provide students on Facebook with a <em>personal benefit</em> by helping them to enrich their profile with a course profiles badge that listed their OU courses, and then optionally provide them with a <em>social benefit</em> that would allow them to discover each other through that voluntary display of personal information, that is, through a shared declaration of their affiliation with a particular course.</p>

<p>The Course Profiles application is controlled by the students. It is voluntarily installed, and users decide which courses they want to declare (we don't check that they ever have studied - or are studying - a particular course).</p>

<p>Users can <em>optionally</em> discover other users who have declared a particular course using the "Find a Study Buddy" service. Personal privacy setting allow users to determine who can discover them using this service (no-one, only friends, friends and network members, or everyone).</p>

<p>Again - the user is in control.</p>

<p>We don't try to get everyone on a particular presentation of a course to befriend each other, although we can <em>help</em> users find other like-minded ("like-studying") people on the course, <em>if</em> they have declared it using the application and <em>if</em> they are happy to be found.</p>

<p>We can also show users which of their friends has studied a course.</p>

<p>(This also helps spread the application - if you know one of your friends has studied a course and can't be found via the relevant Course Profiles course action page (see the figure above), you might invite them to install the app... ;-)</p>

<p>Although we can't provide private groupings, the application interface does support the <em>de facto</em> emergence of friends groupings around particular courses.</p>

<p>I've started noticing an increasing number of student created, course related groups on Facebook, and our next dilemma is whether we try to cross-promote them from within the Facebook application. My feeling is it would be better if the group creator opted to affiliate their group with our application so that it could be discovered from the application?</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/facebook-fears-its-nothing-new/">Brian Kelly</a> suggests that institutional IT developers "need to engage with successful widely used services". Our Facebook application is to all intents and purposes a skunkworks project; the specification is evolving through discussion between ourselves and our users and whilst there are occasional hiccups and bugs discovered in the wild, we're (i.e. Liam;-) is fixing them in public with the help of the users.</p>

<p>I like to think the Course Profiles app is helping to provide a useful service - certainly, the uptake has been good; 900 users since the soft launch at the start of October. The activity is okay  - around about <s>10</s>5% active a day. We're looking at ways we might try to facilitate wider use, but we're wary of intruding...</p>

<p>PS here are some application user install stats (and an application valuation!) via Adnomics: <a href="http://adonomics.com/about/4472914735">Course Profiles app install stats</a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/groupings" rel="tag">groupings</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/skunkworks" rel="tag">skunkworks</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I was shocked to find in my email this morning the sad news that Jacquie Bennett, active member of the eLearning community and a passionate advocate of ways in which Second Life might be used to support the OU mission on CETLment Island and elsewhere, had died whilst away at a conference.</p>

<blockquote>Jacquie Bennett was a tutor on T171 and then T175 in R03, but many of you will have come across her in other roles such as conference moderator, COLMSCT research associate, Second Life enthusiast and much else besides.&nbsp;

We were shocked to hear that she died suddenly and unexpectedly from a brain haemorrhage whilst at a conference in Austria earlier this week.&nbsp; She was there presenting some of the work she had done with the OU on using Second Life for teaching and learning - she went to bed with a headache and was found by hotel staff the next morning.&nbsp; She leaves a husband and two young children.

<p>One of the reasons I started looking at various ways of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=visualising%20courses">visualising OU courses and qualifications</a> was a conversation in which the main topic of conversation was how difficult it was for our students to see at-a-glance the possible courses they needed to take to get a particular qualification, given the courses they have already taken, <em>or</em> easily ascertain which qualification they may have made good progress towards given a set of individual courses they may have taken out of personal or professional interest.</p>

<p>Looking over the following treemap a couple of days ago, it struck me how much like a courses and qualifications bingo card it was, or at least, could be:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199380734780290"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgW24pI4I/AAAAAAAAALs/dVKEFywquQM/s800/manyeyesTreemapQuals.png" /></a></p>

<p>Given a set of course codes corresponding to the courses taken by a particular person, I could quite easily see these being crossed off on the card.</p>

<p>Where two or more courses are part of an excluded combination within a particular qualification, they could be grouped together by a prominent border, and completion of one course would gray out others in the combination. The border around the excluded combination would be of use when no courses within that combination had been taken yet.</p>

<p>One thing the above treemap representation does not denote is the relative points weighting of different courses - some are rated at 30 points, others at 60, for example. An undergraduate degree typically requires satisfactory completion of 360 points worth of study.</p>

<p>Ideally, this should be reflected in some way. If we allow ourselves to have blank squares within the confines of each qualification, then area could be used to denote points value.</p>

<p>If nothing else, it could be quite an interesting addition to a MySpace personal page!</p>

<h3 class="title">News Education, Daily Learning</h3>

<!--
<p>While I was away on holiday, one of the things I pondered but had no opportunity to blog was the potential for <em>daily learning</em> as a practical consequence of a positive attitude towards <em>lifelong learning</em>. It seems to me that <em>lifelong learning</em> is something we might value as a society, whereas <em>daily learning</em> is something far more practical - a learning equivalent of "Think global, act local".</p>

<p>So what is <em>daily learning</em>? Practical activity that demonstrates a lifelong learning attitude, maybe? Knowingly engaging in some sort of learning activity each day, potentially as the result of some sort of internal monologue (or dialogue?) in which we might ask ourselves one of the (journalistic?) questions: <em>who, what, where, when, how, why?</em> about ... anything, I guess.</p>

<p>News stories offer one particularly good, contextualised opportunity for daily learning, presenting us with situations where we might engage in our own analysis of a news story, or maybe looking at the wider context in which occurs. </p>

<p>So it was interesting to read see this post today "<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/09/07/nyt">'New York Times' Enters Distance Learning Market</a>" (via <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=41620">Downes</a>) which picked up on a New York Times Company press release ("<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-pressArticle&amp;ID=1048818&amp;highligh">The New York Times Introduces an Online Complement to College and University Courses, Providing Enhanced Classroom and Distance Learning</a>").</p>

<p>The press release states:<br />
<blockquote>The New York Times introduced today a new online initiative that pairs Times content with faculty course material for both credit-bearing and continuing education courses. Educators will now have the opportunity to select Times articles, archival content, graphics and multimedia content, including videos and Webcasts, gathered around specific subjects, and make them available to students online, along with other course materials. Students will benefit from access to thematic content that is drawn from the vast array of Times reporting on a countless number of issues.</p>

<p>This innovation is a significant expansion of The New York Times Knowledge Network, a program that has provided copies of the paper, accompanied by curriculum guides, to faculty at colleges and universities for several years, bringing the resources of The Times into classrooms as part of the learning experience. Now, with this new component of the Knowledge Network, Times content will be readily available to students online, whether they're enrolled in an on-campus course or continuing their education through a distance learning program.</p>

<p>In addition to enhanced course offerings for college students and lifelong learners, the Knowledge Network will serve as a global networking and professional and academic development resource for faculty, students and alumnae. Users will be able to share work with colleagues, create their own academic or professional ePortfolios (digital repositories of a person's work), invite peer review and establish professional contact with people around the globe based on common academic pursuits and research.</blockquote><br />
So - a learning network, with bundled content from NYT companies. Interesting...</p>

<p>Stephen also picked out the following out of the <em>insidehighered</em> post: "[Some of the online courses will also make use of Times content that is a centerpiece of the services being offered to colleges, on enrollment-based subscription plans. ] These packages will provide access to special packages of content - summaries of articles, interactive maps, video, audio, graphs - on a wide range of topics (the European Union, nanotechnology and so forth)."</p>

<p>It's easy to see how data mashups and interactive infographics could figure in these packages (see some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/">examples of New York Times interactive graphics</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, "Professors at institutions that subscribe would be able to make customized course Web pages, with their own content alongside these content packages." So first it was roll-your-own textbooks (e.g. O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.safariu.com/">SafariU</a>), now it's roll-your-own NYT supplements. (I wonder when the Economist will join in?!)</p>

<p>[UPDATE: Martin has just posted a nicely considered piece on this news announcement: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEdTechie/~3/154939315/nyt-enters-educ.html">NYT enters education market, and the changing nature of newspapers</a>]</p>

<p>The original press release goes on:<br />
<blockquote>This new component of Knowledge Network is available via the Epsilen(TM) Environment (<a href="http://www.epsilen.com">www.epsilen.com</a>), a newly developed Web-based software package that provides a wide range of tools and services for faculty members and students, including ePortfolios, Global Learning System (courseware), group collaboration, object sharing, blogs, messaging, and social and professional networking. Users receive a lifelong identity on the Epsilen(TM) system, enabling them to maintain their academic and professional ePortfolios throughout their careers, regardless of their affiliation with individual institutions.</blockquote><br />
Did you see that keyword?</p>

<p>"... Users receive a <em>lifelong</em> identity on the Epsilen(TM) system..."</p>

<p>How many HEIs offer <em>lifelong</em> access to their VLEs and personal portfolios, with free (or paid-for subscription) top-up, CPD or "contined interest" services to alumni, I wonder?</p>

<p>So what is Epsilen? Its front page proudly declares: <br />
<blockquote>WHAT IS EPSILEN?<br />
 Epsilen places social networking and ePortfolios in the center of global eLearning, creating a totally new environment for the next generation of learners and professionals. Some current Epsilen users describe Epsilen as an academic "MySpace" and "FaceBook", connecting peers to share knowledge and exchange objects.</blockquote></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't get in to Epsilen to see what it's like: "Please note that only U.S. higher educational email addresses are accepted for free registration. Educational email addresses are those that end with .edu. Exceptions can be made for non-educational email addresses and for institutions/communities that are Epsilen members."</p>

<p>If you do have a <em>.edu</em> email address and are a member of the Epsilen Environment, could you post a few screenshots, please? :-) It all sounds very <a href="http://www.elgg.org/">elgg</a>-like to me ;-)</p>

<p>PS grab yourself a coffee and then check out this 5 minute 'game'/interactive brochure: <a href="http://www.willyoujoinus.com/">Energyville</a>, developed by Chevron in association with, err, <a href="http://www.economistgroup.com/energyville.html">The Economist Group</a> ;-)<br />
<blockquote>Energyville, developed using data and content provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit, examines the economic, environmental and security opportunities and trade-offs associated with different energy sources. In order to provide fuel and power to their city's homes, offices, factories and vehicles, Energyville players must balance the same competing demands faced by policymakers, businesses and consumers every day. Spanning a period from present day to 2030, players manage the energy supply for their growing city through random events that affect their choices and highlight the consequences of their actions.<br />
...<br />
Energyville represents an average industrialised global city, with population and energy demands, uses and costs, based on projected patterns using data from the Economist Intelligence Unit and organisations such as the OECD and the Energy Information Administration. During the game, players must choose between eight prevalent energy sources to power their city up until 2015 and 10 different sources up until 2030. As players move through the game's phases they learn about the characteristics of the energy sources and negotiate real life scenarios that can affect their energy choices. The economical, environmental and security implications of their chosen energy portfolio are calculated using an energy management points system. Players can compare scores with other players, challenge a friend and debate the results...</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108867433496186418"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RuZX3OIaDjI/AAAAAAAAAms/EyJUYb2LMfY/s400/energyville1.png" /></a></p>

<p>I came away from the game with a raised awareness of some of the possible 'threats' to particular energy supplies, via the (random?) 'events' that disrupted things somewhen around 2020, an awareness that would probably influence my energy source selection if I was to play the game again (and try to improve my score!).<br />
A 'guided play' option for first time player uses pop-up post it notes to provide a basic in-game tutorial, although the interface is intuitive enough to use without instruction.</p>

<p>PPS The New York Times just added a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/new_york_times_launches_facebook_app.php">NYT daily news quiz Facebook app</a> to their portfolio too... It includes some cunning tricks to drive traffic to the New York Times website, too...</p>

<p>For many participants in higher education, getting a degree plays an important part in career development. At the OU, many of our students have traditionally been in full or part-time employment prior to, as well as during, their studies. Another category of learner - let's call them leisure learners - take up formal learning as a way of structuring their personal hobby time by exploring a particular subject in some depth, with a community of like minded others.</p>

<p>I'm still trying to work out what the audience is for open content courses, such as those provided by OpenLearn. As time goes on (OpenLearn is coming up to 1 year old in October), and as the user base develops, it'll be interesting to find out just what inspires people to make use of OpenLearn resources, and for what purpose.</p>

<p>Maybe we'll find out at the forthcoming <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php">Openlearn conference?</a></p>

<p>Anyway, <em>if</em> career related personal development is part of the motivation, then it maybe that a "job search networking" could contribute to the growth and sustainability of such sites. So it was interesting to see that <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9768418-7.html">Yahoo's new social job network: Kickstart</a> is being toe-dipped amongst US college students.</p>

<p>Apparently, "Yahoo Kickstart connects college students with alumni at the companies that they are interested in. "</p>

<p>Hmmm...</p>

<p>As well as learning for career development, returning to learning is often an outcome of raising aspirations. <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> has long been a site for sharing personal life goals and finding mutual support, although I don't know whether it's also used for job seeking...</p>

<p>When someone takes up adult learning, there is - I suspect - a <em>reason</em> for doing so; a rich context that motivates and drives the learner. I suspect that satisfying, or at least supporting, those wider needs is not something that can be accommodated simply by a virtual learning environment, in much the same way that just publishing course notes does not really help a novice learner to learn from them.</p>

<p>Which is where things like 43things and Kickstart might come in... providing a richer support environment within which informal learning can be pursued <em>in the context of how it might be "exploited"</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe...</p>

<p>...or maybe not...</p>

<h3 class="title">Further Reflections on OU Search</h3>

A couple of people got back to me about the New OU Search Tools post including an interesting exchange with a current OU student who mentioned how useful it would be to be able to search over the materials from...
<!--
<p>A couple of people got back to me about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009229.html">New OU Search Tools</a> post including an interesting exchange with a current OU student who mentioned how useful it would be to be able to search over the materials from previous courses.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought about this in the context of the new search facility, but it's absolutely spot on.</p>

<p>To be truly valuable, our courses should not just provide scaffolding for teaching a particular topic. They should also serve to act as a useful reference work; and for students embarking on a degree, being able to refer back to earlier course materials to reinforce the teaching of topics that are covered in later courses is <em>exactly</em> what we (as educators) want them to be able to do.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily how it works either in practice, or in principle.</p>

<p>For courses delivered as print material - yes, for sure, students retain access to these materials (unless they sell them via <a href="http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/">University Book Search</a>) - but they're often inaccessible, stored in the attic or the cupboard under the stairs.</p>

<p>For courses delivered electronically, access to online materials is cut off 2-3 months after the end of a course. The materials are not searchable via the library, even for registered students, and for the HTML delivered courses, it's not necessarily the case that PDF or easy download bundles (chm or zipped archives) are made available, (though I've described elsewhere how it's possible to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009169.html">use the Firefox Scrapbook extension to download OU online courses</a>).</p>

<p>What this means is that students effectively don't own their course materials on the electronically (HTML) delivered courses, whereas they do own the print materials.</p>

<p>PDFs of print based course materials are now increasingly available for download - which as I've pointed out before means students get two permanent copies of print course materials (the print copy itself and the PDF download), and no permanent copies of HTML delivered materials.</p>

<p>I'd heartily recommend students to download these materials <em>whenever</em> they get the chance, and store them in a single OU course materials directory on their computer that is indexed by an effective desktop search tool (such as Google Desktop or Copernic Desktop Search). In this way, you'll build up a searchable archive of OU course materials. Do the same for HTML courses - grab the materials with something like Scrapbook and archive them on your own machine.</p>

<p>There are apparently all sorts of <em>policy issues</em> that are being thrown up by the federated search tool, so it will be interesting to see how they play out...</p>

<p>Reflecting on how the system might be used against itself (trying to lock down ownership of the course content - especially for people who PAID FOR IT - is not going to work folks...) I wonder how personal archiving of materials by be possible within the e-portfolio?</p>

<p>For example, will students will be able to save copies of their course materials as their <em>stuff</em>? (The working name for the e-portfolio is currently <em>My Stuff</em> - check out Guy Carberry's <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">design blog</a> for screenshots. The <em>My Stuff</em> name is  - apparently - not much appreciated by students...)</p>

<p>Several things immediately came to my mind simply by asking this question:<br />
<ol><li>will students be able to lodge PDFs  - indeed, any arbitrary file types - in MyStuff? Something like <a href="http://elgg.net/">elgg</a> is agnostic, I think, as to what you care to lodge in your portfolio;</li><br />
<li>will students get a MyStuff results tab on the search results page when MyStuff is up and running and federated search integrated with it? I think this was hinted at at the VLE Briefing on Tuesday, but I deleted my notes before I got to post them (oops...)</li><br />
<li>will students be able to search within PDFs using the MyStuff search tool?</li><br />
<li>should we be looking at providing an e-book reader with embedded study support tools, such as annotation tools, for use within the e-portfolio? O'Reilly Safari U e-books can be viewed using an interesting looking reader from <a href="http://www.fourteen40.com/">Fourteen40</a></li><br />
<li>how long will students retain access to content stored in MyStuff? Again, I think it was suggested at the VLE briefing that students would retain access to their portfolio for two years (2 years after what, I don't recall... completion of their last course, perhaps?) In addition, it was stated that access to the portfolio would continue between course presentations. Which seems sensible, if students haven't stated whether they are on a degree profile or not.</li><br />
<li>how much storage space will be made available? will it be free? secure? backed up? Support for third party storage APIs and export-to-desktop is something that has been mooted, I believe, but is not guaranteed. I have heard from several people that the amount of storage that should be provided is causing concern, which concerns me somewhat. I watched the Gmail landing page counting up the megabytes of free storage that's available to users on Gmail today, (I just watched it tick over 2.8 gigabytes), and reckon I must have access to well of 20 gig of free storage round the web, as well as my Amazon S3 account, which I must have spent all of 20p on last month (it was a heavy month ;-). And I also note that online office app providers are starting to work with online storage providers (like <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/omnidrive-becomes-perfect-with-zoho/">Zoho and Omnidrive</a>, for example).</li></ol></p>

<p>The idea of gaming the portfolio also came to mind - by which I mean students using the portfolio to store electronic copies of course materials - exactly those materials to which student access is cut-off from after 2-3 months.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it may make sense to have an area of MyStuff that automatically stores copies of course materials from presentations the student has studied, (maybe <em>without</em> a bulk export option even). This material could then linger in MyStuff while the student still has access to their e-portfolio. Or maybe, if the student has stated an interest in pursuing a degree programme (rather than one or two courses) this statement flags the retention of course materials within their portfolio. The student's ostensible commitment to a degree programme then provides the 'perk' of legacy course materials within their portfolio.</p>

<p>Breaking the problem of (search) access to course materials down a little further, I think we can identify:<br />
<ol><li>course materials for courses the student is currently studying (or has recently finished); the time at which course materials become searchable is also related to this. Do students gain access when they register for a course, or a week or two before the course start date (why not 3 weeks in advance, or 4?), or on the actual start date itself?</li><br />
<li>course materials from courses the student has previously studied; this is partly addressed in the discussion above relating to preserving access to previously studied materials via the e-portfolio;</li><br />
<li>materials from courses the student has not yet studied; preventing students from studying these materials means they cannot skim the materials for a course online, even if they are considering taking that course. Google booksearch and Amazon both support limited browsing of books, so why can't we do the same for our materials. <em>Especially</em> when it's not necessarily the course materials that represent the OU's value proposition.</li></ol></p>

<p>The easiest way of handling search over these three classes is to let registered students <em>search over all of them</em> - forgetting about access permissions and seeing this as a <em>usability</em> issue - and then provide obvious search limits/filters for previously studied courses and currently studied courses. Maybe inspection - or download - of materials outside these limits needs to be restricted? I don't know...</p>

<p>One final question to think about - if students could search over the whole OU course corpus, and a student studying a level 2 course turned up something relevant from a related level 3 course that they used to improve their understanding of the topic being studied, would we be happy or sad? If they found a level 1 treatment of the subject (in a course the student <em>had not studied</em>) that clarified for the student a misconception about, or unstated assumption in, the level 2 material, would we be happy or sad?</p>

<p>Related to this - are students more or less likely to take follow on courses if they stumble across materials from those courses while researching topics covered in lower level courses?</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Discounts with the Tesco Clubcard</h3>

...or should that title be: Towards a TescOU? ?! An interesting announcement I just picked up from an OU student blogger about the forthcoming Tesco Clubcard deal that will allow the use of Tesco Clubcard vouchers in full or part-payment...
<!--
<p>...or should that title be: <em>Towards a TescOU?</em> ?!</p>

<p>An interesting announcement I just picked up from an <a href="http://larnach.blogspot.com/2007/01/tesco-club-card-vouchers-and-ou.html">OU student blogger</a> about the forthcoming Tesco Clubcard deal that will allow the use of Tesco Clubcard vouchers in full or part-payment for OU courses: <a href="http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/deals/product.aspx?R=456&bci=4294966476%7CEducation">Tesco Education Deals</a>.</p>

<p>[For non-UK readers, <a href="http://www.tescocorporate.com/">Tesco</a> is to UK supermarkets what Google is to web search. Their dominance of the market means they can't help but be evil, as their large stores get larger and their ownership of smaller convenience stores develops apace.]</p>

<p>A couple of interesting things to notice about the announcement. Firstly, the link from the Tesco site is to the OU at <a href="http://www.openuniversity.co.uk/clubcarddeals">www.openuniversity<strong>.co.uk</strong>/clubcarddeals</a>. </p>

<p><img alt="oucouk.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oucouk.png" width="587" height="65" border="0" /></p>

<p>Secondly, the advertising slogan that's being used for the campaign:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/ouseful/RbOjUayC72I/AAAAAAAAAAw/ZKZ73Nh0lro/OUtesco.png" alt="OU Tesco ad - feed your mind -  - if you see this, Picasa is not serving up the image, again...." /></p>

<p>I have to admit the first thing I thought of on seeing this was the <a href="http://www.planetdogrecords.com/comp.html">Planet Dog record label</a> who used the title "Feed Your Head" for several compilations ;-)</p>

<p>Another thing to notice about the landing page is the "Get instant answers" query box, which seems to feed in to a natural language asking, FAQ answering service provided by a company called <a href="http://askadmission.net">askadmission</a>, who don't seem to have a  working homepage at the moment. Googling them turns up several academic institutions who use the service, which seems to run under the "Virtual Advisor" brand.</p>

<p>The OU landing page for this QnA service is <a href="http://www.askadmission.net/open/aeresults.aspx">here</a>; although an OU branded page is offered for the resutls, you still see the askadmission URL, which is a bit scrappy.</p>

<p>Back to the Tesco deal, and it's informative to see who else has signed up to their <em>education products</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="tescoEducation.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tescoEducation.png" width="582" height="55" border="0" /></p>

<p>I wonder when Tesco will start selling education products, as well as finance deals, telecoms services and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5396488.stm">"own brand" software</a> at their supermarket cash tills?</p>

<p>This isn't necessarily as far-fetched as it sounds - Tesco already run <a href="http://www.tesco-debut.com/">Tesco Debut</a> - which offers "on-line training and development, financial guidance, discounts and career advice to help 16-24 year-olds through the transition from full-time education to full-time careers."</p>

<p>And get this - "So far, 21,071 students have become members of Debut, and we have launched our Debut Clearing House scheme, which organises transfers for students between their home stores and stores local to their university." Ah, bless...</p>

<p>(If you know anyone who can get me screenshots from inside the site, I'd be interested to see them. Maybe I need to set up a Tesco Blogoscoped site to track this sort of stuff?)</p>

<p>Anyway - back to the Clubcard site: at the moment the OU is one of five items listed in the Tesco education deals area, the others being Brilliant Books, Linguaphone (who get two entries for some reason) and The National Extension College.</p>

<p>As the Tesco deals give you 10 worth of tokens for every 2.50 worth of tokens ('earned' at a conversion rate of 1 pence per point, and 1 point per pound spent) I'd be interested to know how the cash flows for making up the 4:1 exchange rate (and what <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk">HEFCE</a> might have to say about that ;-)</p>

<p>What with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/gift-vouchers/">OU Gift Vouchers</a> as well as Tesco Clubcard vouchers, I'm starting to wonder again just what it is we <em>sell</em>, exactly?</p>

<p>When I discovered that the OU regional offices had their own IP ranges, I thought it might be OUseful to knock up a small web service that would return the corresponding region number. This service can then be used to help customise the return of content that is tuned to a particular region.</p>

<p>I haven't thought of any useful applications of this yet, except this crude <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/thisRegion.php">demo page</a> that will forward the user to the corresponding regional office page (such as <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/details.aspx?contactid=4">this one for Region 04</a>) if they try to view it from an OU regional office.</p>

<p>Anyway - for what it's worth, here's the link: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php">IP address to OU regional office identifier service</a>.</p>

<p>The information is returned in the form:</p>

<p>&lt;pingBack&gt;<br />
 &lt;ipAddress&gt; 123.25.67.89 &lt;/ipAddress&gt;<br />
 &lt;ouLocation&gt; RegionNN  &lt;/ouLocation&gt;<br />
&lt;/pingBack&gt;</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php?demo=demo">a demo</a>.</p>

<p>If you're in an OU regional office, a visit to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/whatRegion.php">this page</a> should tell you which:-)</p>

<p>If you know of - or can think of - services that would benefit or support regional office localisation, let me know...</p>

<p>If you want to use the service, mail me, and I'll give you a stable URL for the service.</p>

<ol><li>For collecting links in a course team while a course is in production. We could do this with a social bookmarking tool, of course, but search is easier... and getting new domains into the search engine is just a case of bookmarking them, really...</li><br />
<li>For providing a course search engine, in which all the external links mentioned in a course (particularly online courses) are used to prioritise results in an otherwise general Google search;</li><br />

<!--
<p>Are these the first signs of a changing attitude towards protable media, I wonder? At least two courses I know of now provide students with portable devices as part of the supplied course materials: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google</a> sends out a 256Mb MP3 player to students at the start of the course, and the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t885">T885 Team Engineering</a> students leave the weekend residential school at the start of their course with a 256Mb USB memory stick (and a webcam, too...).<br />
 <br />
The devices are OU branded, as these photos of the USB memory stick and the MP3 player show <s>(I'll add a pic of the T885 memory stick to this post as soon as I get one)</s>:</p>

<p><img alt="T885usbDrive.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/T885usbDrive.jpg" width="542" height="253" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="ou-mp3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ou-mp3.jpg" width="553" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="ou-mp3b.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ou-mp3b.jpg" width="553" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p><br />
The T885 memory stick is not preloaded with anything, although I believe students do load photos onto it during the residential school, that they must take away and then share somehow. T885 is exploring all sorts of social software tools - blogs, wikis, maybe even flickr?, and I hope to post more about it in the coming weeks...</p>

<p>The TU120 MP3 player does comes preloaded with some audio files recorded by the course team and used within the course. As such, the player is used to deliver content to students, as well as providing them with a portable - and standalone - means of consuming it.</p>

<p>However, the TU120 MP3 player is not preloaded with any software (though it could be...) although the mailing the player is sent out with does contain the OU Online Applications CD (which I've <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=online%20applications%20cd&IncludeBlogs=1149">mentioned several times previously</a>).</p>

<p>As I have the current CD handy, here are a few screenshot from the installer to show what's on it:</p>

<p><img alt="ola1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ola1.png" width="575" height="498" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="ola2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ola2.png" width="576" height="398" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="ola3.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ola3.png" width="574" height="562" border="0" /></p>

<p>As far as I know, the Firefox installation is a vanilla one - i.e. I don't think there are any OU customisations applied to it.</p>

<p>I've been thinking for some time about what Firefox customisations we might usefully provide, either as extensions, or preloaded into an OU distributed Firefox installation package and I hope to post some demos relating to that topic in the next 2 to 3 weeks...</p>

<!--
<p>Chatting to someone last week about <a href="http://opinmind.com">opinmind</a>, a sentiment analysing blog search tool, we idly wondered whether anyone in the Communications or Student Services departments at the OU occasionally looked at things like <a href="http://opinmind.com/search.jsp?q=%22open+university%22">opinmind search on "open university"</a>, or similar searches on general blogsearch engines such as  <a href="http://sphere.com">Sphere</a>, more specifically via spaces like <a href="http://search.blogger.com/?as_q=%22open+university%22">Blogger</a> or using site limited searches, such as this one on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22open+university%22+site%3Amyspace.com">MySpace</a>.</p>

<p>We suspected not...</p>

<p>Anyway, I just had a quick look and turned up various interesting things I didn't know about.</p>

<p>For example, someone had picked up that a new OU course on elearning - <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01wH808">The eLearning Professional</a>  is now being advertised for a September 2007 start. I think this is being written from <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk">IET</a>, which does a lot of worthy stuff in the area of elearning/educational technology research. It'll be interesting whether the systems critiqued in the course include the OU's Moodle VLE, which will almost definitely play some role in the delivery - or student experience - of H808 ...</p>

<p>Something else that turned up was a <a href="http://www.publictechnology.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=5590&newlang=&topic=13&catid=0">post</a> about a "new web-based system which allows students studying for postgraduate computing qualifications to choose or propose their dissertation topics online." Going under the name of <a href="http://pads.open.ac.uk/">PADS</a>, it offers a listing of project titles available for students to pursue, and presumably some administration tools. PADS doesn't seem to appear anywhere on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/kn/PADS">IET Knowledge Network</a>, though it does just about make it via a news story onto the first page of the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/">intranet</a> search results.</p>

<p>PADS seems to have been developed outside the current raft of institutionally sponsored internal IT projects, like the VLE and ECM programmes, so I wonder how well it will integrate with them ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess this approach of having to look to the blogosphere <em>outside</em> the OU to find out what's interesting going on <em>inside</em> it is the networked equivalent of attending international conferences in order to stand a chance of meeting other staff from the same organisation who are working in similar areas to you!</p>

<!--
<p>This is a really lazy post describing a demo (and obsolete!) mobile WAP site for students currently studying an OU course, cut and pasted from <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/index.html">here</a> but while it's 5 years or so old as far as I'm concerned, it may be of interest to people who are starting to look at mobile sites again.</p>

<p>When I built the site, it provided an interesting exercise in identifying what sort of content could be sensibly and OUsefully delivered via a small screen, in this case using WAP pages (though I did also get half-way through building an SMS equivalent, which really concetrated the mind in terms of character count!)</p>

<p>A year or so later, I put together another website, this time targetted at <em>potential</em> rather than current (on a course) students: <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/TSCPwap.html">Technology Short Course Program (TSCP) Experimental WAP Service</a>.</p>

<p>It was brought to mind by <a href="http://www.zinadoo.com/">Zinadoo</a>, a basic and easy-to-use mobile web page builder, which made me think that I haven't tried building a mobile site for ages...</p>

<table><tr><td><p>After a temporary welcome screen, users are presented with the WAP service home-page:</p></td><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/main.gif" alt="main page screen shot" width="178" height="225" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img alt="overview menu screen shot" border="0" src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/overview.gif" width="181" height="222"></td><td><p>The T396 Overview provides information for students interested in taking T396. This information mirrors that provided on the Courses and Qualifications website for T396.</p><p>In particular, it includes administrative information (course level, the number of credit points, etc.) as well as a short summary of the course.</p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/newinfo.gif" alt="new student info screen shot" width="186" height="213" border="0"></td><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/summary.gif" alt="summary info screen shot" width="183" height="222" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><p>A wide variety of information is provided for currently enrolled students. This includes alerts regarding Stop Press information that has been made available, information regarding the status of course related mailings and the dates of TMA of deadlines.</p></td><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/info.gif" alt="info screen shot" width="183" height="223" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/errata.gif" alt="errata screen shot" width="184" height="224" border="0"></td><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/mailings.gif" alt="mailings info screen shot" width="184" height="224" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/tmadates.gif" alt="TMA cut-ff dates screen shot" width="185" height="221" border="0"></td><td><p>An additional page identifies the current, previous and next topic of study, with reference to the Study Calendar for the course.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>I think an SMS strategy is currently being looked at in the OU by student services, and mobile Moodle of some sort is also on the cards, I think, but I've not heard - or seen - anything definite as yet...</p>

<p>If any OU readers know about OUr mobile strategy, I'd be keen to hear about it... :-)</p>

<!--
<p>How can we use blogs to maximum effect in an OU course context? In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007310.html">When Your Past Comes to Haunt You</a>, I posted a news item about the recent AOL search data release that would potentially have been of interest to students studying <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>, if it had been in presentation at the moment, or of interest to alumni of that course as an 'alumni updating' service.</p>

<p>As it is, <em>Beyond Google</em> does not present for the first time until October, 2006; and as the course is still in production, there has been time to integrate the story of AOL's release of search data to the web into the course text.</p>

<p>At the end of that post, I also included what amounted to a text ad for the course, although I didn't go so far as adding a graphical banner ad!</p>

<p>Here, then, are several potential ways of gaining OUse-value from a blog post:</p>

<ol><li>as a <em>benefit to <strong></strong> students</em>, through pthe provision of <em>enrichment material</em> for students currently studying the course; that is, material that is optional and not assessable, but which provides and alternative way of looking at concepts or issues introduced in the course through relating them to contemporary news items;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to <strong>alumni</strong> students</em>, as updating material (think of this as a free upgrade to some software you have purchased); </li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to <strong>potential</strong> students</em>, leading them to a course that they were otherwise unaware of as the result of coming across a post in a subject they are interested in, or searching around;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to the <strong>wider community</strong></em>, as material that becomes discoverable via a search engine hence potentially the answer to somebody's search query;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to the <strong>course team</strong></em>, through providing draft content that can potentially be included in future presentations of the course, as well as maintaining current awareness within the course team about the state of the contemporary search landscape.</li></ol>

<p>Integrating 'live' posts - that is, course content created whilst a course is in presentation  - within the course as a topic scheduled for study  by students as a timetabled item on the course calendar is another possibility, although it raises many issues regarding the design of a) the course materials, and  also b) any related assessment material.</p>

<p>Typically, assessment material is completed before the start of the course. The OU Technology short course model means that all the assessment material for the course is provided to the students at the start of the course - an open book, known item assessment(?) strategy.</p>

<p>Writing assessment materials that can cope with content that <em>has not been written</em> at the time assessment material is prepared poses certain challenges, although strategies are available for phrasing such material. For example, questions may be asked along the lines of:</p>

<p>"Choose one of the posts that appeared on the Beoyond Google post between <em>course start date</em> and <em>assessment submission date</em>. What were the major issues/technical innovations described in the post? How are these likely to affect the current search landscape?"</p>

<p>Okay - so that's a bit contrived. But it's a pointer to the sort of question we might ask. (The <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk">Technology Short Course Programme</a> courses are aimed in part at recruitment to undergraduate study from under-represented groups and adult returners to education, so the assessment style is intended to help develop study skills and encourage reflective learning as much as anything.)</p>

<p>Another approach might be to associate a question with a blog post at the time the post is written, and feed that into the assessment engine as an optional question. One problem with this approach is that it means students addressing the assessment at different times may effectvely be presented with different question papers.</p>

<p>However, where students are required to pick '2 from 3' questions in a traditional assessment, they are then essentially <em>answering</em> different questions for assessment (<em>qua</em>mark giving) purposes. </p>

<p>And more importantly, if we are to start exploring personalised, emi-automated, rolling assessment, then this might provide one way of feeding new questions into the question bank and  reducing opportunities for plagiarism, for example by requiring students to answer <em>m</em> from <em>n</em> course blog post related questions from a <em>p</em> week window occurring within the period of time they are registered on the course.</p>

<p>The scope for innovation in all sorts of areas is huge at the moment, but I fear that we are not exploring, or even scoping, the <em>possibilities</em> as passionately as we might be...</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we had a presentation from <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2427">CJ Rayhill</a>, CIO at O'Reilly's <a href="http://safariu.com">SafariU</a> 'self-service, text book on demand' website. Here are some lightly edited notes from the session...</p>

<p><em>How could O'Reilly help out in academic publishing?</em></p>

<p>Been around for 25 yrs, now a media company, not just a book publisher.<br />
As well as printed content, are O'Reilly are into <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">conferences</a> and developer communities (like <a href="http://www.onlamp.com">ONLamp.com</a> and <a href="http://xml.com/">XML.com</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://sarafiu.com">SafariU</a> is a free service to academia, providing free access to O'Reilly materials, mix and match contact, also in assocation with academic's own material, delivery in print or online. SafariU also includes a learning object exchange, plus shareable playlists.</p>

<p>SafariU driven by the idea that there must be a better way to deliver reference materials to students than high cost textbooks.</p>

<p>Consultation with users (academics?) suggests they desire:</p>

<p>- One stop shop<br />
- Mix and match<br />
- Upload own materials<br />
- Combine materials<br />
- Online or print<br />
- Share compilations</p>

<p>O'Reilly-<br />
Online library (safari books online 50% owned each O'Reilly and Pearson) - separate to O'Reilly<br />
<a href="http://www.bvdep.com/">Bureau van Dijk</a>, Belgium, host <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p>SafariU - went into beta 01/2005, redesigned from ground up following beta</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> XML server is the core component at heart of SafariU.</p>

<p>SafariU came out of beta 3/06 - <a href="http://www.safariu.com">www.safariu.com</a></p>

<p><em>Business model:</em> free to academics, but student body must consume a certain amount of material ($700 per year) over the course of a year. O'Reilly sell print-on-demand (POD) versions of textbooks to resellers (e.g. campus  bookshop) $0.16 per page (print); or online service (pay-per-time)).</p>

<p>If course uses e.g. material from several books and articles, with snippets of material provided by instructor, the student sees links to the full source books (presumabaly so they can then read/buy into those).</p>

<p>So the student pays to access the content...[hmm - in OU, we tend to provide the majority of third party content, e.g. course readers etc. as part of course, though there is a mixed model across OU wrt text books being bundled with course materials or student self-purchased.]</p>

<p>But there are also corporate payment/access mechanisms (?)</p>

<p><a href="http://safarix.com/">SafariX</a> (Pearson) - multi-subject, textbook only service; student access to online equivalent of textbook for 50% of print cost. <a href="http://www.netg.com/">Thomson NETg</a> appears to be another player in the area...</p>

<p>XML.com (and other O'Reilly web properties) etc. can be searched over from SafariU.</p>

<p>Within SafariU, academics bundle content in projects. 5 steps in building project:</p>

<p>- gather material<br />
- organise material (drag and drop interface, estimated page count, estimated cost to student)<br />
- print options (cover customisation, use own logos, binding options)<br />
- review (e.g. generate inspection PDF copy)  - can at this point go back to step 2,2;<br />
- reorder/reorganise material, index and contents will then be regenerated interactively<br />
order (generates ISBN)</p>

<p>Projects may be public or private (private for own use/own student use), public can be shared.</p>

<p>Looking to experiment with offline viewing options - e.g. socially motivated context (shareable annotations, comments)</p>

<p>Can't modify content (rights), but can write your own bridges. Can also import third party material if you clear rights and make it private.</p>

<p>In print version, each extracted section is branded at start of section wiith original source.</p>

<p>SafariU native (non-uploaded) content internally stored as XML [so we could get XML output...?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a> interested in the SafariU platform (not the content) so SafariU will be providing platform services for Autodesk...</p>

<p>[is there going to be an API?]</p>

<p>No e-commerce layer at the moment. But e.g. a trainer might have a private project, print copies of the book, and then resell them privately. [Hmmm, how does the copyright work there?]</p>

<p>Compilation is property of SafariU, but original content is retained by author. [So we wouldn't own the rights to any compilation we produced? Hmmm...]</p>

<p>User uploads of PDF only (to prevent users e.g. uploading powerpoint with animations etc.)</p>

<p>But - there will be links out to multimedia materials.</p>

<p>No repagination of uploaded material BUT repagination of the native (XML) SafariU content. (Some guidance to style provided.)</p>

<p>Generate dynamic table of contents and index; no bibliography generation(?).</p>

<p>Won't index uploaded PDFs (yet) or some of the old, originally uploaded Pearson content (which omitted index terms).</p>

<p>docbook format, <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">XML mind</a> editor used internally, future potential for contributor upload of XML as well as current PDF upload.</p>

<p>No limit on amount that can be taken from one book.<br />
Minimum print book order number 10<br />
min page count 100<br />
max page count 820</p>

<p>After one print run, and delivery of course, instructor can go back in and revise content, reprint etc [same book but different edition? would the book get a new ISBN that's viewable via xISBN for example?]</p>

<p>At tmoment, if original source material included in compilation were uploaded, the compiler does not get an alert, but this may be something for the future.</p>

<p>?What about errata? No notification/feed thru of errata to sites/collections where content is used - <em>yet</em>...</p>

<p><em>Online:</em> within a syllabus, content from up to 10 book titles.<br />
Able to see which students have logged in to the syllabus.</p>

<p>SafariU - just a content delivery mechanism - not a full LMS.</p>

<p>Students want an offline option - what that might be is being explored - e.g. options that support highlighting, annotation etc. Value added, not just PDF. </p>

<p>Untethered options (??), offline use is current priority.</p>

<p>SafariU environment can be customised (cf. Autodesk relationship), so O'Reilly could host an OU look and feel SafariU environment for the OU.</p>

<p>Exploring federated search options (but then there are likely to be copyright hassles with reusing third party material not contained in SafariU).<br />
 <br />
SafariU/books online cleared for international use.</p>

<p>??<a href="http://www.bookshare.org">bookshare.org</a> - they can get SafariU content. [?Bookshare? - hmm - "Bookshare.org dramatically increases the accessibility of books for people with visual or other print disabilities." Maybe something the OU should look at?]</p>

<p>O'Reilly likes bookshare.</p>

<p>Search underlying SafariU will be reused to search O'Reilly in general.</p>

<p>Possible to purchase rights to republish x copies of someone else's book, upload those into a private project and integrate them with SafariU materials.</p>

<p>SafariU is a self-service, interactive offering.</p>

<p>NH: OU way is not me as academic putting together a course; it's me as academic in a CT doing some things, but other stuff gets done by/control passes to other people.</p>

<p>Costs are scarey for OU (scaleable) use.</p>

<p>Potential for shared authentication between OU students authenticated into Moodle and across to SafariU (perhaps branded in OU way and provided as content page withing Moodle).</p>

<p>NH: How does OU business model change if we go down SafariU route (e.g. no need to purchase, warehouse and ship several thousand copies of a book over several years).</p>

<p>[??expensive to recruit students - could federated search into our content help with recruitment and contribute to a reduction in this cost?]<br />
[Could we guesstimate numbers of books required, get them printed and have them shipped to Amazon's MK warehouse???;-) Set-up some sort of just-in-time/just-after-order print model with despatch to Amazon for fulfillment when enough orders are in? What's the POD turnaround time?]</p>

<p>?OU going to move towards sourcing more and more comtent from outside.<br />
O'Reilly moving away from pure publishing more into a service for educators.</p>

<p>Small amount of OU Business School is produced as print-on-demand already.<br />
[<blockquote>The term "print on demand" within the publishing industry has become almost entirely linked to publishers needs for rapid production of single copies to fulfil single orders.  This is probably not a huge need for the University though Materials Procurement has been supplying the Business School with supplementary materials produced as print on demand.</blockquote>]</p>

<p>JC - 3 yr update cycle not sustaible.<br />
NH - you think it'll change in next 5 yrs...?</p>

<p>JC: shorter update cycle will happen<br />
NH: should - should happen...but it won't...not quickly...</p>

<p>O'Reilly talking to <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/solutions/itunes_u/">iTunesU</a> about potential collaboration. [Hmmm - something else to add to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">corporate academic computer services</a> mix!]</p>

<p>OU library - 15 concurrent users to Safari books online via Proquest [see: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006589.html">ISBN Safari lookup Greasmonkey script</a>], which doesn't suit the OU in terms of cost/concurrent users etc. (important for a university with 180, 000 online students).</p>

<p>Interesting model would be for course to provide online material, and give student freedom to select and pay for the 'send me a printed copy' version.</p>

<p>OU has deal with <a href="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/cases/cases_home.jhtml">Harvard Business School</a> press to gain 1-click access to HBS materials. [Hmm - couldn't find a particular reference to that in the Library - maybe just 'yet another e-collection'?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oreillylearning.com/">Learning Lab</a> - online course product from O'Reilly???  Hands-on online environment for providing students access to virtual sys admin simulators etc. Covers programming languages, server admin, operating systems etc. [need to look at this...]</p>

<p>Current OU business model - e.g. course costings tool - just couldn't countenance using SafariU like methods.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://gilbane.com/case_studies/oreilly_case_study.html">O'Reilly SafariU case study</a></p>

<p>Safari Books online via Library still likely to be useful in addition to SafariU (though Safari online is v expensive and limited to 15(?) concurrent seats).</p>

<p>Two-dimensional view of publishing: free-premium content on one axis, atomised-packaged content on the other. Market would like free-atomised, textbooks traditionally premium-packaged.</p>

<p>However, textbook model does not necessarily reflect usage (e.g. read sections 2-3 of chapter one, and sections 4-7 of chapter 2 - most(!) people don't read textbooks like novels).</p>

<p>[A lot to think about here in terms of remodelling OU production and delivery processes...]</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> if you're the podcast listening type, check out this <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/06/09.html">conversation between Jon Udell and CJ Rayhill about Safari U and technology in education</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">University Challenge - Growing Your Audience</h3>

<!--
<p>When it was originally founded, the Open University mission was in part to take Higher Education to the people other HEI's couldn't reach - from the start, our mission was a one of widening particpation. In recent years, <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/">widening participation</a> has become a matter of general concern across the HE sector as a whole, as well as focussing attention <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/widening-participation/">even within the OU</a> (internal readers can check out the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/cwp/">Centre for Widening Particpation</a>, for example).</p>

<p>Faced with this competition for attracting students from various minority (and even majority) groups, I wonder if there is another target group for <em>widening participation</em> that is emerging as a result of <em>lifelong learning</em> inititatives.</p>

<p>To step back for a minute, one of the aims of widening participation is to make Higher Education available to people who, for whatever reason, haven't had the opportunity or encouragement to benefit from it.</p>

<p>So what's the potentially missing group? How about lifelong learners who would benefit from a <em>continued</em> relationship with Higher Education throughout their lifetime. What I'm thinking of here are people who need - or would just like - to either maintain current awareness in, or benefit from enrichment of,  a particular subject area, source a continual programme of knowledge or skills updating (either work or leisure related) or even (!) learn about new subject areas.</p>

<p>(Note that there is a difference in kind between learners who are graduates compared with students who are new to HE - the level of their study skills (graduates <em>should</em> require less study skills training!) so perhaps invoking this audience as a candidate for WP is not really appropriate...)</p>

<p>There are post-undergraduate options available to learners , of course - second degrees, higher  (Masters level) degrees and CPD (Continuing Professional Development) courses (here's the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/cpd/">OU scheme</a>, for example), of which the CPD courses are perhaps the most suited to lifelong learning.</p>

<p>But what I have in mind is more of a subscription model to learning, akin to subscribing to a news feed. For example, several OU courses are exploring the use of course team blogs in part for <em>enrichment</em> of courses. This is not something that has been a major feature of standalone OU courses to date, but it is something that is in the air at the moment. One of the opportunities that arises from enrichment (and news related) topics in a course blog is that they are meaningful to a wider audience, such as the course alumni. So for students who are actually <em>interested</em> in the subject matter of the courses they have done, what I'd like to imagine is that they maintain their feed subscriptions when they finish the course (and pehaps graduate with a feedrool/blogroll  that incorporates feeds from at least some of the courses they have studied).</p>

<p>This model - that gettting students to subscribe to a course feed - is part of a longer play that extends way beyond the time the student actually spends on a particular course. And this in turn should perhaps make us question <em>how</em> we would want students to subscribe to feeds when they first start a course:</p>

<p>- if the feed is delivered seemlessly in a course area of the VLE, why would students take a subscription away at the end of the course? </p>

<p>- if the feed is delivered seemlessly to a personal area of the VLE, with automatic subscription to the feed when the student starts the course, but requires them to unsubscribe when they no longer want it (and perhaps they aren't allowed to unsubscribe till they finish/withdraw form the course?;-) then why would they take the feed away when they graduate? (Perhaps we'd give then an OPML file when they leave?)</p>

<p>- if the students have to subscribe to the feed in a personal feedreader, outside the VLE, most won't...</p>

<p>As well as maintaining a relationship with its own graduates, I wonder too how an HEI might go about pitching for the lifelong learners who graduated from elsewhere, but for whom consuming  top-up, or even just enrichment, educational materials represents just another part of their everday media consumption habit.</p>

<p>For example, think of a degree programme as like a TV season (i.e. a bunch of related programming that a channel hopes will retain it's audeince). How do channels (i.e. HEIs) a) retain audience; and b) steal audience from other channels?</p>

<p>Posting on <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2006/05/the_changing_me.html">The changing media business model</a>, Forrester's <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/">Charlene Li</a> observes:</p>

<blockquote>But what I think best typifies News.com's unique approach is their "Extra" section. It started as "More News From Around The Web" where the editors selected top stories from other sites. It's evolved into a place where you can read about tech stories from all around the Web, even if CNET's News.com isn't covering it. So there's an article wireless technology from Business 2.0, and a story on Steve Ballmer's comments on Vista includes a link to the News.com story, as well as links to stories from competitors like TechNewsWorld, PCWorld, and Wired News.

<p>That's akin to The New York Times linking to the New York Post, The San Francisco Chronicle linking to The San Jose Mercury News, and dare I say it, Forrester linking to Jupiter or Gartner! But if you take the social computing view that as a publisher, you can't serve ALL of the needs of your customer yourself, then the best that you should do is to be the FIRST source of information for your audience. In that way, News.com ensures that although it may not be the ONLY source of technology news, it has a fighting chance of filtering and aggregating that news for its audience better than anyone else. </blockquote></p>

<p>Hmm...so we need compelling content, and we need to be willing to link outside.</p>

<p>Is the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">Open Content Initiative</a> a candidate for this I wonder? I guess that very much depends on the extent to which they develop the social portal aspect of it...</p>

<h3 class="title">Customer Participation at Amazon.com</h3>

<!--
<p>Ever since posting a quick review of the OU course catalogue (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">OU Course Catalogue Takes Lead from Amazon?</a>) I've been meaning to have a scan through the Amazon.com site to have a look at their tags'n'wiki features.</p>

<p>As it's the (first) end of a long day (before the evening and midnight oil sessions begin:-( I thought I'd spend coffee time seeing just what they've been up to...here's what I found (using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307276902/102-5918465-2257705">no page in particular</a>):</p>

<p><strong>Tags</strong> <img alt="amazonTag.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonTag.png" width="249" height="90" border="0" /></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/16238571/102-5918465-2257705">typical implementation</a>, it seems: tags may be public or private and used for personal, or shared/social, (re)discovery of an item. Tags can be used for pivot searching  - finding items similar to one you have tagged in a particular way by means of looking at what else has been tagged the same way, defining persoanlly meaningful categories and so on. Tagged/bookmarked items can be used as an informal 'not quite Wish List', although it seems that <em>[i]tems you tag will be used as sources from which to make personalized recommendations.</em>.</p>

<p><img alt="amazonTagList.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonTagList.png" width="599" height="129" border="0" /></p>

<p>I'm not sure how useful these tags are, or whether tags would be appropriate in an OU setting if applied to courses/for course choice? Certainly they are useful <em>within</em> a course, when used to bookmark resources relevant to a course, but for course choice, (which is intended to be the focus of this comparison between Amazon and OU catalogues) I think not... </p>

<p><strong>Wikis</strong></p>

<p>Two types of wiki entry are supported: wiki <em>term definitions</em>, which are entries that may be relevant across a wide variety of product wiki entries - for example, author biographies or details of a publishing house; and <em>product wiki</em> entries, which are tied to a particular product.</p>

<p><img alt="amazonWiki.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonWiki.png" width="753" height="252" border="0" /></p>

<p>I'm not sure what happens in the case of different versions of the same product (e.g. the same book with different ISBN numbers, or the same piece of music/opera performed by different people?).</p>

<p>From their advice, Amazon try to make it clear that they expect wiki entries to be a different sort of beast to customer reviews:</p>

<blockquote>What Should You Put In A Wiki?
Think of a Wiki as an encyclopedia entry that everyone who comes to the page will read. You should put in relevant factual information that you believe will be of value to others who visit the page. A Wiki is not the place to express your opinion; that's what Customer Reviews and Customer Discussions are for. As always, please treat the Amazon community with respect by not writing inappropriate or off-topic comments.</blockquote>

<p>Another point of difference between the wiki and customer review entries is the provision of a Wiki Search box, which <em>"enables you to search inside Amazon Customer-edited wikis. Searches can be performed across all wikis, or across product wikis (wikis that appear in the product detail pages), or across wiki term definitions."</em></p>

<p>I'd be intrigued to see what sort of content might appear in a wiki associated with a particular course page in the course catalogue...</p>

<p><strong>Product Forums/Customer Discussion</strong></p>

<p>One customer participation service I hadn't picked up on from the blogosphere is <em>Product Forums</em> (which Amazon describe as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/discussionboard/content/db-guidelines.html">Customer Discussions</a>).</p>

<p><img alt="amazonFOrum.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonFOrum.png" width="614" height="285" border="0" /></p>

<p>In the OU, we have hundreds - if not thousands - of internal forums (i.e. First Class conferences). Conferences associated with the majority  - if not all - of running courses, are open only to students registered on those courses, but alumni conferences for particular courses are also popular, as historically were course choice conferences. With the increasing availability of public course comment, I'm not sure how the course choice confreences are faring now.</p>

<p>Just by the by, it's interesting to see what Amazon's user policy in terms of how who's allowed to use the forums:</p>

<blockquote>Who can participate in discussions?
Customers! Anyone who has purchased items from Amazon.com and is in good standing in the Amazon community can reply to an existing discussion or start a new one. All visitors to Amazon.com can read any current discussion.</blockquote>

<p>So in OU terms, I guess this would be current and alumni students?</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>After this quick look through some of Amazon's community features that wrap product items, I'm not convinced that they'd be very useful in the context of the OU course catalogue. However, they may be appropriate for the OU library catalogue, or more likely the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">OCI</a> (Open Content Initiative) repository, these features may be interesting, e.g. if 'learning objects' within the repository are treated in a similar way to Amazon catalogue items...</p>
