<h3 class="title">Synchronicity in the Air... Institutional Innovation & OU Job Ads</h3>

It's been one of those weeks this week when synchronicity (or maybe confluence) seems to have been in the air... So for example, the week started with brief email exchange regarding knowledge management in the context of tracking and reviewing...
<!--
<p>It's been one of those weeks this week when synchronicity (or maybe confluence) seems to have been in the air...</p>

<p>So for example, the week started with brief email exchange regarding knowledge management in the context of tracking and reviewing and getting feedback/opinion on new technology that might be interesting (one might almost say "OUseful";-) in an OU context. Here was my take on it:</p>

<blockquote>Something I feel we need to explore is find a way of helping information "flow" around the university more, routing it to the right people as needed. A few of us do this anyway in an informal way anyway, either as a broadcast (eg public blog) or point-to-point communication "FYI emails"; thing's like the LTS media monthly newsletter also communicate news items to people who are likely to be interested in such things.

<p>As far as soliciting the opinions of OU members about particular technologies, then we need: a) a way of routing these 'call for comments' to people who can comment quickly; b) getting comments back to the people who need them in an appropriate form.</p>

<p>Being lazy, I'd like to be able to do several things at once with any comments I make - eg: a) get the commentary back to who wants it; b) get a blog post out of it ;-) It'd also be nice to think that there was some way of actually seeing new ideas built on and rolled out across the university.</p>

<p>What's needed is to get a conversation going and give people the feeling that they are allowed to spend time indulging/participating in that conversation, which may be with internal people or it may be with the wider world e.g. through online networks. And requests for comments would just be dropped into that conversation somehow...</blockquote>Then yesterday,  John Tropea/Library Clips posted some thoughts on "<a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2008/07/10/theres-more-than-just-supply-side-km/">Thereâ€™s more than just supply-side KM</a>", (a response to this article on <a href="http://www.reedfirstsource.com/news/members/lnstory%7Edid%7E811371438%7Etopic%7E100002731.asp">Ideation and the Supply Side of Knowledge</a>): "The article is about how much time and energy we devote to: <em>Capturing and storing vs Knowledge flow</em>...[I]n a learning organisation you are aware of solutions as they happen, even if you have no use for them at the time. You can connect to people involved in the solutions, and you are connected to people in general. The act of participating gives more chance of solutions coming to you more easilyâ€¦ you have more of a chance of shared context and the peripheral information around a solution."</p>

<p>The original article - by Raj Datta - also has this to say:<br />
<blockquote>[T]hose who believe that "management" is about control and predictability often view KM as a way to bring about predictability, by documenting all best practices and lessons learnt and making them available to everyone.</p>

<p>Here, the supply side becomes focused on explicit knowledge, on identifying and generating quality content, and generally focused on learning from the past. The hidden assumption is that once the right answers are all available in the repository, everyone will come seeking it. Demand, it's assumed, is automatically created. This then produces a robust internal knowledge (content) market, complete with consumers and producers of knowledge (content).</blockquote>Now where I thought this argument would go was along the lines of: even we do manage to curate information about new technologies effectively, that information is not necessarily going to be worked effectively if that information doesn't continue to circulate - or "flow" - around the organisation, as part of an ongoing conversation within the organisation, in particular the conversation between those people who can benefit from the information, work it further, or work it into conversations with other people who might benefit from it.</p>

<p>But it didn't, at least not in such crude terms... (Even so, the "flow" argument is still one of the take home messages I'll (mis)remember the article by! )</p>

<p>What the original article does go on to talk about is how organisations potentially miss out on creating new knowledge, because they are too busy mining the past:<br />
<blockquote>But even if one were to subscribe to this viewpoint, it has at least one obvious shortcoming. By equating KM with content management, and by equating the purpose of KM with predictability and control, we may inadvertently de-emphasize new knowledge creation.<br />
...[N]ew knowledge creation is about the future. It's about possibilities and alternatives. It's about doing things differently and unleashing creative energies. It's about innovating.</p>

<p>Companies that are serious about innovation have to create an organizational ecosystem that allows for creativity to be sourced, transformed into inventions and then into innovations. This forwardlooking view gives KM a new meaning and purpose. Companies that are able to foster new knowledge creation alongside the more traditional view of KM, are able to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency and between innovation and productivity. This is a necessary condition for longevity in a global knowledge economy.</p>

<p>Why ideation?</p>

<p>Ideation is the first step in the whole process of innovation. A good way to judge whether a company is serious about innovation is to see what happens to ideas in that company Some indicative questions are: Who is responsible for generating ideas? Once generated, how are ideas transformed to inventions?</p>

<p>If these questions have been explicitly considered in the organization, then chances are that the first step towards a generative view of KM strategy has been taken. This shows that the company values knowledge creation.</p>

<p>If these questions are implicit, or we have to search for the answers, then chances are that a strong enough focus doesn't exist yet in the organization. If the R&amp;D department is viewed as the place where ideation happens and inventions take place, then we are again [li]miting the potential of tapping into the collective creative energies of the organization. R&amp;D personnel are not the only ones with ideas and creative minds, and open processes should exist to tap into the collective capabilities of employees.</p>

<p>As well as creative minds that generate ideas, we also need minds that know how to transform wild ideas into feasible implementation projects and we need minds that are able to understand market potential and how to tap into it. In short, we need to transform ideas to inventions and then inventions to innovations, tapping into the collective insights and capabilities of complementary minds. Base skills, competences and strengths may differ across employees, and by themselves have limited use, but the power of tapping into their collaborative capability is tremendous.</blockquote>This line of thinking resonates strongly with me. After almost 10 years here, I still don't understand how the OU manages to take internally produced "inventions" and work them up to a state where they can be delivered as institutional innovations... Although maybe that's about to change?</p>

<p>OU Job Ad: <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3871&amp;ref=ouseful">Change Manager, Developments Manager, Two Senior Project Managers,  Learning Innovation Office (LIO), Strategy Unit. Based in Milton Keynes.</a><br />
<blockquote>Fascinated by the use of new technologies to enhance the learning experience in higher education? A Learning Innovation Office is being set up within the Open University's Strategy Unit to coordinate the development of elearning and innovative teaching and learning. Building on the University's new virtual learning environment (VLE), the Office will commission and oversee further development work, coordinate elearning strategy and policy, and monitor and disseminate learning innovations at the OU and elsewhere.

You will report to the Developments Manager in the Learning Innovation office and you will need excellent project management and communication skills and significant experience in administration or systems development to provide effective management of these initiatives.</blockquote>As well as those posts, there is also this rather wonderful sounding post:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3872&amp;ref=ouseful"><strong>Director of Multi-Platform Broadcasting, Strategy Unit</strong></a><br />
Europe's largest and most innovative university is seeking an outstanding individual for the new post of Director of Multi-Platform Broadcasting, which has been created following a major review of our broadcasting strategy.</p>

<p>You will be responsible to the Pro Vice Chancellor (Strategy, Planning and External Affairs) for the achievement of the University's ambitious broadcasting objectives.</blockquote>I'm not sure whether this post in marketing will report in any way to that post, though?<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3830&amp;ref=ouseful"><strong>Marketing Manager, Marketing and Sales</strong></a><br />
In this new role has been created to focus on developing marketing plans covering BBC programming, Widening Participation &amp; Openings and other marketing projects. You will work with marketing colleagues in the OU and BBC to scope and identify education and training opportunities for the Widening participation sector, opportunities to promote the BBC and marketing our Openings courses. You will also develop and manage fulfilment of a marketing plan to these markets and identify appropriate channels to market.</blockquote>Business innovation is also in the air:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3889&amp;ref=ouseful"><strong>Senior Project Manager, Europe. Futures Office, Strategy Unit</strong></a><br />
We wish to appoint an outstanding individual to the Futures Office, to manage the implementation of the OU's strategy for Europe. You will liaise with key stakeholders across the OU and externally to evaluate and identify the optimum business model for the OU's operations in central Europe, shaping the OU's strategic priorities for international growth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3891&amp;ref=ouseful"><strong> Communications Program Manager (Business to Business), Marketing and Sales</strong></a><br />
Reporting to the Head of Customer Communications, as part of the sub unit management team, you will lead the planning, development and execution of marketing programs for the business to business segment; targeted to increase OU awareness and to generate enquiries from employers resulting in sponsored students, CPLD (Centre for Professional Learning and Development) revenues, etc.</p>

Open University Validation Services is responsible for providing Open University validation for external academic programmes; and vocational awards through the OU Awarding Body. More than 33,000 students are currently registered for validated and vocational awards in more than 50 partner organisations. The University is currently investing in a restructure of OUVS and an expansion of our team.  As part of our expansion we are seeking a Senior Manager (Administration) to manage central support services including management of registrations, certification and aftercare services.</blockquote><em>Disclaimer: none</em>... ;-) Except maybe the OUVS post... I have an idea for an OUVS webservice that's being considered in part under the SocialLearn banner...</p>

<p>Needless to say, I have nothing to do with appointments to any of those posts, at the dizzying heights such as they are (I'm way down the food chain, and on the academic side of the fence too...). That said, I'll probably heckle whoever does get in and try to grab a coffee with them every so often! <div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/recruitment" rel="tag">recruitment</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/innovation" rel="tag">innovation</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Apologies that this round-up falls so soon after the last, but there have been quite a few posts advertised recently that may be of interest to some readers... The deadline for quite a few of them is this week...</p>

You should have a sound knowledge of at least one programming language and have experience of relational databases. Our main development platform is the Microsoft .net framework; we also use packages, including Siebel CRM, Documentum and SAS. However we will provide training where needed.

<p>There are a couple of more senior posts, too, that look interesting:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3085&ref=ouseful"><em>Chief Executive, University Centre Milton Keynes</em></a>: The colour of the building materials is significant but the finest academic institutions are defined by the talent, experience and leadership of people like you. In this newly created role you'll influence the development and direction of a brand new academic enterprise. Milton Keynes is a progressive, thriving centre ready to embrace economic growth, and at the heart of its expansion will be the new University Centre Milton Keynes. Embracing the needs of local businesses and communities, the Centre will be a focal point for 21st century higher education. It will combine state of the art technology, research, knowledge transfer and creative learning methods to inspire potential students and encourage new commercial activity. And you'll provide the strategic vision, curriculum development, financial management and inspirational leadership that enable its success.</li>
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3089&ref=ouseful"><em>Professor of International Higher Education Policy, Centre for Higher Education Research and Information (CHERI)</em></a>: Applications are invited for the position of Professor of International Higher Education Policy. The post-holder will play a leading role in the further development of the Centre as a leading international research centre in the field of higher education policy.</li></ul>

<!--
<p>A week or two ago I posted about the possibility of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">Search Powered Predictions</a> in which I idled about whether might be able to make use of users' search behaviour to try and predict potentially popular new courses.</p>

<p>Today, I came across <a href="http://www.spotplex.com/">Spotplex</a>, which "provides internet users with real-time ranking of blog articles based on actual impression count".</p>

<p>Apparently, it works like this:<br />
<blockquote>1. A blogger inserts a Spotplex code into their blog.<br />
2. Whenever an article in the blog is read, the code reports Spotplex server that the article is read.<br />
3. The article shows up on Spotplex and the view counter reflects the change.</blockquote></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be good if we had an internal version of this running for course pages listed in the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/">OU Course catalogue</a>?</p>

<p>Or how about using page reads as implicit votes in a prediction market for the number of students likely to register on a particular course...</p>

<p>...because apparently students are leaving it later and later to register on our courses (I wonder if they are holding out for sale prices on the course fees? Although I guess if they're Tesco punters they could always use <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009219.html">Tesco Clubcard vouchers as part payment for their OU course fees</a>?</p>

<p>With the post of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2902">Director, Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a> currently being advertised (<em>Salary negotiable</em>, apparently), I wonder just how different things would be internally if a 2.0 type was appointed?<br />
<blockquote>Employing 490 editors, graphic designers, web designers, audio-visual specialists and software developers, our Learning and Teaching Solutions is responsible for the production and delivery of all our learning materials. Under your direction, the unit will bring to life the creations of our academic specialists, delivering world class print material, CD ROMs, DVDs and web pages, plus cutting-edge Blogs, Wikis, ePortfolios and eAssessment engines to power our Virtual Learning Environment. This will involve constant liaison with academic Faculties and Schools, the Student Services division, the Library and our research institutes to keep us at the forefront of best practice.</p>

<p>To take on this exceptionally influential role, you will require considerable experience of producing distance learning media and deep understanding of new and evolving educational technologies. Joining us at a time of profound change, you will apply your imagination and expertise to shape the educational experiences of thousands of students around the world â€“ and build on our unrivalled reputation.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, the above is nothing to do with me (even more so than usual given the relative seniority of the post), but if you do apply etc etc <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009723.html">normal rules apply</a> (except - as a finders fee - I'd also like 10% of the negotiated salary to buy me a developer for a week or two of agile development time (?!) ... ;-0)</p>

<p>A part of me is a little bit reluctant to keep making this sort of post quite so frequently, but seeing the jobs that are being advertised in the OU is quite a good indicator of where various priorities were a couple of months ago (when the posts were presumably secured...;-)</p>

<p>So let's see what's currently open that may be of interest to <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a> readers... As ever, I have absolutely nothing to do with the appointment of any of the below:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2869"> Business Systems Analysts / Application Developers, Academic & Administrative Computing Services</a>: "Many of our projects are to deliver business change, and we are particularly interested in hearing from analysts with business process design experience. A flexible approach is essential. While Microsoft.net is our main development platform, we also support a wide variety of legacy systems and use packaged software, including Siebel's Customer Relationship Management and Documentum's Enterprise Content Management software."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2870&ref=ext"> Media Developer - Editing (possible trainee position), Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a>: "we are looking for an experienced editor from book, journal or online publishing to contribute to the production and delivery of distance learning materials. You will edit learning materials from our Faculty of Mathematics & Computing. Our editors, working as media developers, make a critical contribution to the quality of our courses, collaborating closely with academics and other specialists to deliver world-class learning materials across a wide range of media and disciplines."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2826&ref=ext">ICT Development Officer (Faculty of Education and Language Studies)</a>: "An internal secondment has provided the opportunity for someone who is able to formulate ICT systems and web policies to join us on a fixed-term contract. As the Faculty's principal source of advice and expertise in these areas, you will design, manage and evaluate support systems and web projects."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2825&ref=ext">Systems and Network Administrator, Creating The Next Generation Web, Knowledge Media Institute</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for a Systems & Network Administrator who will join the IT & Systems Team and support the day to day Linux and Windows network services. You should have a good track record of working with and supporting Linux in the context of a large organization."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2886&ref=ext">Two Research Fellows: Audio-visual Content Analysis and Search Engines (Knowledge Media Institute)</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for two Postdoctoral Research Fellows to undertake research in within the context of an EU/IST-funded integrated project, PHAROS, which is the main IP funded by the EU in a recent call on audio-visual search technologies. The PHAROS project aims to build a next generation audiovisual search platform, to be designed, developed and applied jointly by a consortium consisting of leading academic and industrial players with proven track records in innovation and commercial success. The Multi-Media Information systems group of the KMi is the key player in developing core search technologies within this project including advanced content-based visual search engine and visual content analysis."</li></ul><br />
There's also this post, I notice:</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2860&ref=ext"> Head of Directorate, Marketing and Sales</a>: this one seems to come up regularly (or maybe I'm just confused...?). If so, then presumably career marketeers are only good for one project per organisation to keep their CV ticking over. Achieving things like a rebranding exercise, for example, or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009219.html">establishing a relationship with a large affiliate scheme</a>;-)</p>

<p>On the marketing front, I hope that whoever gets the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2868&ref=ext">Online Marketing Manager (Marketing and Sales)</a> post talks to any appointed <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2884&ref=ext">Assistant Alumni Manager (Open University Business School)</a> about linking at least a few of the 2 million+ OU alumni into to some sort of social network...</p>

<p>[If you go for any of the above posts, please mention that you saw it mentioned on <em>OUseful.info</em> (or perhaps it's better that you don't??? ;-). I also expect a coffee in your first couple of weeks of taking up any post :-)]</p>

<h3 class="title">OU eLearning & Semantic Web Job Opportunities</h3>

<!--
<p>Okay - here's another OU recruitment round-up post prompted, as ever, by a job ad I saw in today's Technology Guardian supplement for a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2671&ref=ext">Product Development Manager</a>.</p>

<p>As we go about "re-defining elearning" (as what, I wonder?) the <em>Product</em> Development Manager will help manage "our move from print to the web as a primary delivery medium". </p>

<p>[I'm always twitchy as to how well that fits in with the Widening Partcipation (or even, widening participation) agenda (there are several posts open that programme too - check out the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/jobs-external.asp">general recruitment site</a> for more info). Because I'd be very surprised if the majority of OU students have sole, quality access to broadband connected PCs (and I use the 'PC' term advisedly...). But that's an argument for another time and place...]</p>

<p>Anyway - the Product Development Manager:<br />
<blockquote>will be a proven innovator capable of managing staff in a creative environment and have expertise in modern publishing technologies. Experience of software, print and web production processes, and appreciation of the role of new technologies in developing high-quality, value-for-money multi-media materials is essential.</blockquote></p>

<p>To see where the post is in the wider scheme of things, you could always take a look at the OU organisational charts (available under the Freedom of Information Act, for some reason, <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/p3_7.shtml">here</a>). In particular, check out the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/pics/d17350.ppt">organisational chart for LTS</a>. Slide 13 of 25 (?!) is the one I think you want... <em>if</em> these charts do accurately describe the current organisation of LTS, that is:</p>

<p><img alt="ltsOrgChart.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ltsOrgChart.png" width="747" height="498" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you go for it, it's probably best <em>not</em> to mention you saw the ad here ;-) That said, as one of the duties is:<br />
<blockquote>ensuring that staff involved in media production are kept informed about new pedagogic and technical possibilities across the range of media for learning and teaching, and that best practice is transferred across the University</blockquote><br />
I'll probably add you to my mailing list if they haven't thrown me out before then... ;-)</p>

<p>However, please do give me a plug as to where you saw the ad if you go for either of the two Research Fellow positions on "Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web":</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2677">Research Fellow: Semantic Web and Grid Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in the area of semantic web and Grid services - applying semantic web technology to support the management of web and Grid services. This work takes place within the context of our EU-funded project Living Human Digital Library (LHDL) which will create the technical infrastructure for the <a href="http://www.tecno.ior.it/VRLAB/LHP/">Living Human project</a>.</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2676">Research Fellow: Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in applying semantic web services to eLearning as part of the Euro-funded <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/luisa/">LUISA</a> project.</p>

<p>Both those posts appear to offer a home for Lisp hackers, so if Lisp's your thing, here's a rare opportunity to <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/lisp.do">earn less than the going rate</a>... (does anyone teach Lisp nowadays? ;-) </p>

<p>Just by the by, also from <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk">ITJobsWatch</a> [ ...  ;-)] here's the trend for <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ajax.do">Ajax related jobs</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="ajaxJobs.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ajaxJobs.jpg" width="451" height="262" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'd love to spend a bit of time looking at would be seeing how things like IT developer job ad trends correlate not only across different programming languages, but also with book trends (e.g. as explored by <a href="http://research.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Research</a>).</p>

<p>For example, it would be neat if the IT Jobs Watch site could produce charts like this one about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/08/programming_language_trends_1.html">Programming Language Books - Relative Trends</a></p>

<p><img src="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/plangtrend.png" width='480' height='310' alt='programming language trends chart' /></p>

<p>and even neater if you could plot both sets of data against each other. E.g. do the books lead or lag the job market?</p>

<p>I suppose there's always <a href="http://google.co.uk/trends?q=%22ruby+on+rails%22%2Cjavascript%2Cajax%2Cc%2B%2B">Google Trends</a> to look at too, though that data is a) far from complete, and b) likely to be very noisy...</p>

<p><img alt="gTrendProgLang.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gTrendProgLang.jpg" width="592" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>PS the <em>Further Particulars</em> for the Product Manager job state:<br />
<blockquote>The Open University currently requires its academic, research and academic-related staff to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.  For this reason, we are unable to accept applications from individuals over the age of 65.  Applications will be accepted from individuals under the age of 65, however, individuals should note that once employed they will be required to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.</blockquote></p>

<p>Nice to know we're open as to age in our employment policy....<br />
<blockquote>From 1 October 2006, new laws protect workers from age discrimination. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations make it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees, trainees or job seekers because of their age and ensure that all workers, regardless of age, have the same rights in terms of training and promotion.<br />
...<br />
All employees will have the right to request to work beyond the age of 65 or any other retirement age (if there is one) set by the company, and employers will have a duty to consider, although not to accept, such a request. This will involve an employee meeting with their employer to discuss the request. An employee will have a right of appeal if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the meeting. This policy will be reviewed in 2011. <br />
<a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/newsdetail.cfm?sectionID=44&newsid=678">Age Discrimination Legislation - information and help for employers and individuals  </a></blockquote><br />
Err...? How does that work then? Maybe I'm missing something... Can you be considered to have considered something, even if you know beforehand what answer you are going to give?</p>

<h3 class="title">YUI Widgets Available for OU Online Course Materials?</h3>

<!--
<p>Picked up from Jim Ellis' monthly Interactive Media Newsletter is the news that Moodle will be using the Yahoo User Interface (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>) toolkit as the 'official' Moodle Ajax tookit. </p>

<p>(For a demo of what the YUI supports, see <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/javascript/15-things-you-can-do-with-yahoo-uiprint/">15 Things you can do with Yahoo! UI</a>; for reference, see the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/06/02/yui-utilities-cheat-sheets/">YUI cheatsheets</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder if this means that OU online course materials delivered through the Moodle environment will also be "allowed" to make use of YUI functionality? If so, I wonder what the repercussions are for the OU online course materials XML schema (we are supposed to be moving towards an XML workflow...) More on this in a later post, (which may end up on the NOUS blog, depending how contentious it is ;-)</p>

<p>More OU news - there are a couple of posts being advertised over in IET:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2483&ref=ext">Senior Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: Your key role will be lead programmer and developer for institutional and externally funded IT projects. You will focus on several concurrent projects, including working with national and international partners developing tools such as a Learning Design player, mentoring and student support system, online surveying, eLearning support and knowledge management services. <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/pp/a.little/index.cfm?page=ld">Alex Little</a> was blogging odd bits about the learning design player, I think, and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/">Martin Weller</a> has also <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/08/learning_design.html">blogged about LAMS in an OU context</a>.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2491&ref=ext">Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: The key role of this position is to carry out software and web development for a variety of externally-funded educational technology projects. Past projects have included knowledge management tools, a learning design player and new feature development for the open-source virtual learning environment Moodle. There is a growing interest in social software in the Institute and it is possible some projects may be in this area.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2487&ref=ext"> Two Learning and Teaching Development Officers, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: We are expanding the Learning and Teaching Development Team which works across the Institute and the University to provide support for the University's learning and teaching strategies. The team are involved in cutting-edge projects, including: evaluating new course material for Open University students; getting to grips with the challenges of student retention; exploring innovative methods of online assessment; working with academics to explore best usability practice in teaching.</li></ul></p>

<p>If you go for any of these posts, please mention that you saw it advertised on the OUseful blog...</p>

<p>... or don't ... (blog post reading wastrels, pah!;-)</p>

<p>Hmm - what else is new...? Ah yes, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/">this</a> caught my eye (after a pointer from <a href="http://www.jvvw.com/index.php">Juliet</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="courseReviewDown.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseReviewDown.jpg" width="511" height="192" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's also put paid (temporarily, I hope) to the reviews that were fed through to course pages on the the course catalogue. If you can't remember what they looked like, I (thankfully) took a few screenshots for an earlier post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">reviewing the OU course catalogue web pages</a>.</p>

<p>Juliet's observation also sensitised me to this post (obtained via <a href="http://downes.ca">Downes</a>) critiquing: <a href="http://www.pebbleroad.com/article/the_changing_face_of_university_websites/">The Changing Face of University Websites</a>.</p>

<p>And as I'm on the topic, for readers with SAMS access, check out <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">Guy Carberry's blog</a> on design matters relating to OU materials (both print and web-based)... it's good stuff...</p>
