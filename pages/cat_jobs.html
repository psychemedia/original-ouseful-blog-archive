<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3085&ref=ouseful"><em>Chief Executive, University Centre Milton Keynes</em></a>: The colour of the building materials is significant but the finest academic institutions are defined by the talent, experience and leadership of people like you.

Milton Keynes is a progressive, thriving centre ready to embrace economic growth, and at the heart of its expansion will be the new University Centre Milton Keynes.

<a name="009937"></a>
<h3 class="title">Click Powered Predictions...?</h3>

<p>A week or two ago I posted about the possibility of <a href="./009726.html">Search Powered Predictions</a> in which I idled about whether might be able to make use of users' search behaviour to try and predict potentially popular new courses.</p>

<p>Today, I came across <a href="http://www.spotplex.com/">Spotplex</a>, which "provides internet users with real-time ranking of blog articles based on actual impression count".</p>

<p>Apparently, it works like this:<br />
<blockquote>1. A blogger inserts a Spotplex code into their blog.<br />
2. Whenever an article in the blog is read, the code reports Spotplex server that the article is read.<br />
3. The article shows up on Spotplex and the view counter reflects the change.</blockquote></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be good if we had an internal version of this running for course pages listed in the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/">OU Course catalogue</a>?</p>

<p>Or how about using page reads as implicit votes in a prediction market for the number of students likely to register on a particular course...</p>

<p>...because apparently students are leaving it later and later to register on our courses (I wonder if they are holding out for sale prices on the course fees? Although I guess if they're Tesco punters they could always use <a href="./009219.html">Tesco Clubcard vouchers as part payment for their OU course fees</a>?</p>

<p>With the post of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2902">Director, Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a> currently being advertised (<em>Salary negotiable</em>, apparently), I wonder just how different things would be internally if a 2.0 type was appointed?<br />
<blockquote>Employing 490 editors, graphic designers, web designers, audio-visual specialists and software developers, our Learning and Teaching Solutions is responsible for the production and delivery of all our learning materials. Under your direction, the unit will bring to life the creations of our academic specialists, delivering world class print material, CD ROMs, DVDs and web pages, plus cutting-edge Blogs, Wikis, ePortfolios and eAssessment engines to power our Virtual Learning Environment. This will involve constant liaison with academic Faculties and Schools, the Student Services division, the Library and our research institutes to keep us at the forefront of best practice.</p>

<p>To take on this exceptionally influential role, you will require considerable experience of producing distance learning media and deep understanding of new and evolving educational technologies. Joining us at a time of profound change, you will apply your imagination and expertise to shape the educational experiences of thousands of students around the world â€“ and build on our unrivalled reputation.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, the above is nothing to do with me (even more so than usual given the relative seniority of the post), but if you do apply etc etc <a href="./009723.html">normal rules apply</a> (except - as a finders fee - I'd also like 10% of the negotiated salary to buy me a developer for a week or two of agile development time (?!) ... ;-0)</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Job Ads Roundup...</h3>

<p>A part of me is a little bit reluctant to keep making this sort of post quite so frequently, but seeing the jobs that are being advertised in the OU is quite a good indicator of where various priorities were a couple of months ago (when the posts were presumably secured...;-)</p>

<p>So let's see what's currently open that may be of interest to <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a> readers... As ever, I have absolutely nothing to do with the appointment of any of the below:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2869"> Business Systems Analysts / Application Developers, Academic & Administrative Computing Services</a>: "Many of our projects are to deliver business change, and we are particularly interested in hearing from analysts with business process design experience. A flexible approach is essential. While Microsoft.net is our main development platform, we also support a wide variety of legacy systems and use packaged software, including Siebel's Customer Relationship Management and Documentum's Enterprise Content Management software."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2870&ref=ext"> Media Developer - Editing (possible trainee position), Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a>: "we are looking for an experienced editor from book, journal or online publishing to contribute to the production and delivery of distance learning materials. You will edit learning materials from our Faculty of Mathematics & Computing. Our editors, working as media developers, make a critical contribution to the quality of our courses, collaborating closely with academics and other specialists to deliver world-class learning materials across a wide range of media and disciplines."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2826&ref=ext">ICT Development Officer (Faculty of Education and Language Studies)</a>: "An internal secondment has provided the opportunity for someone who is able to formulate ICT systems and web policies to join us on a fixed-term contract. As the Faculty's principal source of advice and expertise in these areas, you will design, manage and evaluate support systems and web projects."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2825&ref=ext">Systems and Network Administrator, Creating The Next Generation Web, Knowledge Media Institute</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for a Systems & Network Administrator who will join the IT & Systems Team and support the day to day Linux and Windows network services. You should have a good track record of working with and supporting Linux in the context of a large organization."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2886&ref=ext">Two Research Fellows: Audio-visual Content Analysis and Search Engines (Knowledge Media Institute)</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for two Postdoctoral Research Fellows to undertake research in within the context of an EU/IST-funded integrated project, PHAROS, which is the main IP funded by the EU in a recent call on audio-visual search technologies. The PHAROS project aims to build a next generation audiovisual search platform, to be designed, developed and applied jointly by a consortium consisting of leading academic and industrial players with proven track records in innovation and commercial success. The Multi-Media Information systems group of the KMi is the key player in developing core search technologies within this project including advanced content-based visual search engine and visual content analysis."</li></ul><br />
There's also this post, I notice:</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2860&ref=ext"> Head of Directorate, Marketing and Sales</a>: this one seems to come up regularly (or maybe I'm just confused...?). If so, then presumably career marketeers are only good for one project per organisation to keep their CV ticking over. Achieving things like a rebranding exercise, for example, or <a href="./009219.html">establishing a relationship with a large affiliate scheme</a>;-)</p>

<p>On the marketing front, I hope that whoever gets the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2868&ref=ext">Online Marketing Manager (Marketing and Sales)</a> post talks to any appointed <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2884&ref=ext">Assistant Alumni Manager (Open University Business School)</a> about linking at least a few of the 2 million+ OU alumni into to some sort of social network...</p>

<p>[If you go for any of the above posts, please mention that you saw it mentioned on <em>OUseful.info</em> (or perhaps it's better that you don't??? ;-). I also expect a coffee in your first couple of weeks of taking up any post :-)]</p>

<h3 class="title">OU IT/elearning Related Job Opportunities Round-Up</h3>

<p>As ever, I was alerted to the current crop of possibly interesting OU job opportunities by someone from outside the OU...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU eLearning & Semantic Web Job Opportunities</h3>

<p>Okay - here's another OU recruitment round-up post prompted, as ever, by a job ad I saw in today's Technology Guardian supplement for a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2671&ref=ext">Product Development Manager</a>.</p>

<p>As we go about "re-defining elearning" (as what, I wonder?) the <em>Product</em> Development Manager will help manage "our move from print to the web as a primary delivery medium". </p>

<p>[I'm always twitchy as to how well that fits in with the Widening Partcipation (or even, widening participation) agenda (there are several posts open that programme too - check out the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/jobs-external.asp">general recruitment site</a> for more info). Because I'd be very surprised if the majority of OU students have sole, quality access to broadband connected PCs (and I use the 'PC' term advisedly...). But that's an argument for another time and place...]</p>

<p>Anyway - the Product Development Manager:<br />
<blockquote>will be a proven innovator capable of managing staff in a creative environment and have expertise in modern publishing technologies. Experience of software, print and web production processes, and appreciation of the role of new technologies in developing high-quality, value-for-money multi-media materials is essential.</blockquote></p>

<p>To see where the post is in the wider scheme of things, you could always take a look at the OU organisational charts (available under the Freedom of Information Act, for some reason, <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/p3_7.shtml">here</a>). In particular, check out the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/pics/d17350.ppt">organisational chart for LTS</a>. Slide 13 of 25 (?!) is the one I think you want... <em>if</em> these charts do accurately describe the current organisation of LTS, that is:</p>

<p><img alt="ltsOrgChart.png" src="./ltsOrgChart.png" width="747" height="498" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you go for it, it's probably best <em>not</em> to mention you saw the ad here ;-) That said, as one of the duties is:<br />
<blockquote>ensuring that staff involved in media production are kept informed about new pedagogic and technical possibilities across the range of media for learning and teaching, and that best practice is transferred across the University</blockquote><br />
I'll probably add you to my mailing list if they haven't thrown me out before then... ;-)</p>

<p>However, please do give me a plug as to where you saw the ad if you go for either of the two Research Fellow positions on "Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web":</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2677">Research Fellow: Semantic Web and Grid Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in the area of semantic web and Grid services - applying semantic web technology to support the management of web and Grid services. This work takes place within the context of our EU-funded project Living Human Digital Library (LHDL) which will create the technical infrastructure for the <a href="http://www.tecno.ior.it/VRLAB/LHP/">Living Human project</a>.</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2676">Research Fellow: Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in applying semantic web services to eLearning as part of the Euro-funded <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/luisa/">LUISA</a> project.</p>

<p>Both those posts appear to offer a home for Lisp hackers, so if Lisp's your thing, here's a rare opportunity to <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/lisp.do">earn less than the going rate</a>... (does anyone teach Lisp nowadays? ;-) </p>

<p>Just by the by, also from <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk">ITJobsWatch</a> [ ...  ;-)] here's the trend for <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ajax.do">Ajax related jobs</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="ajaxJobs.jpg" src="./ajaxJobs.jpg" width="451" height="262" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'd love to spend a bit of time looking at would be seeing how things like IT developer job ad trends correlate not only across different programming languages, but also with book trends (e.g. as explored by <a href="http://research.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Research</a>).</p>

<p>For example, it would be neat if the IT Jobs Watch site could produce charts like this one about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/08/programming_language_trends_1.html">Programming Language Books - Relative Trends</a></p>

<p><img src="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/plangtrend.png" width='480' height='310' alt='programming language trends chart' /></p>

<p>and even neater if you could plot both sets of data against each other. E.g. do the books lead or lag the job market?</p>

<p>I suppose there's always <a href="http://google.co.uk/trends?q=%22ruby+on+rails%22%2Cjavascript%2Cajax%2Cc%2B%2B">Google Trends</a> to look at too, though that data is a) far from complete, and b) likely to be very noisy...</p>

<p><img alt="gTrendProgLang.jpg" src="./gTrendProgLang.jpg" width="592" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>PS the <em>Further Particulars</em> for the Product Manager job state:<br />
<blockquote>The Open University currently requires its academic, research and academic-related staff to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.  For this reason, we are unable to accept applications from individuals over the age of 65.  Applications will be accepted from individuals under the age of 65, however, individuals should note that once employed they will be required to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.</blockquote></p>

<p>Nice to know we're open as to age in our employment policy....<br />
<blockquote>From 1 October 2006, new laws protect workers from age discrimination. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations make it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees, trainees or job seekers because of their age and ensure that all workers, regardless of age, have the same rights in terms of training and promotion.<br />
...<br />
All employees will have the right to request to work beyond the age of 65 or any other retirement age (if there is one) set by the company, and employers will have a duty to consider, although not to accept, such a request. This will involve an employee meeting with their employer to discuss the request. An employee will have a right of appeal if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the meeting. This policy will be reviewed in 2011. <br />
<a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/newsdetail.cfm?sectionID=44&newsid=678">Age Discrimination Legislation - information and help for employers and individuals  </a></blockquote><br />
Err...? How does that work then? Maybe I'm missing something... Can you be considered to have considered something, even if you know beforehand what answer you are going to give?</p>

<h3 class="title">YUI Widgets Available for OU Online Course Materials?</h3>

<p>Picked up from Jim Ellis' monthly Interactive Media Newsletter is the news that Moodle will be using the Yahoo User Interface (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>) toolkit as the 'official' Moodle Ajax tookit. </p>

<p>(For a demo of what the YUI supports, see <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/javascript/15-things-you-can-do-with-yahoo-uiprint/">15 Things you can do with Yahoo! UI</a>; for reference, see the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/06/02/yui-utilities-cheat-sheets/">YUI cheatsheets</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder if this means that OU online course materials delivered through the Moodle environment will also be "allowed" to make use of YUI functionality? If so, I wonder what the repercussions are for the OU online course materials XML schema (we are supposed to be moving towards an XML workflow...) More on this in a later post, (which may end up on the NOUS blog, depending how contentious it is ;-)</p>

<p>More OU news - there are a couple of posts being advertised over in IET:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2483&ref=ext">Senior Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: Your key role will be lead programmer and developer for institutional and externally funded IT projects. You will focus on several concurrent projects, including working with national and international partners developing tools such as a Learning Design player, mentoring and student support system, online surveying, eLearning support and knowledge management services. <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/pp/a.little/index.cfm?page=ld">Alex Little</a> was blogging odd bits about the learning design player, I think, and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/">Martin Weller</a> has also <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/08/learning_design.html">blogged about LAMS in an OU context</a>.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2491&ref=ext">Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: The key role of this position is to carry out software and web development for a variety of externally-funded educational technology projects. Past projects have included knowledge management tools, a learning design player and new feature development for the open-source virtual learning environment Moodle. There is a growing interest in social software in the Institute and it is possible some projects may be in this area.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2487&ref=ext"> Two Learning and Teaching Development Officers, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: We are expanding the Learning and Teaching Development Team which works across the Institute and the University to provide support for the University's learning and teaching strategies. The team are involved in cutting-edge projects, including: evaluating new course material for Open University students; getting to grips with the challenges of student retention; exploring innovative methods of online assessment; working with academics to explore best usability practice in teaching.</li></ul></p>

<p>If you go for any of these posts, please mention that you saw it advertised on the OUseful blog...</p>

<p>... or don't ... (blog post reading wastrels, pah!;-)</p>

<p>Hmm - what else is new...? Ah yes, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/">this</a> caught my eye (after a pointer from <a href="http://www.jvvw.com/index.php">Juliet</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="courseReviewDown.jpg" src="./courseReviewDown.jpg" width="511" height="192" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's also put paid (temporarily, I hope) to the reviews that were fed through to course pages on the the course catalogue. If you can't remember what they looked like, I (thankfully) took a few screenshots for an earlier post <a href="./005988.html">reviewing the OU course catalogue web pages</a>.</p>

<p>Juliet's observation also sensitised me to this post (obtained via <a href="http://downes.ca">Downes</a>) critiquing: <a href="http://www.pebbleroad.com/article/the_changing_face_of_university_websites/">The Changing Face of University Websites</a>.</p>

<p>And as I'm on the topic, for readers with SAMS access, check out <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">Guy Carberry's blog</a> on design matters relating to OU materials (both print and web-based)... it's good stuff...</p>

<p><hr /></p>
