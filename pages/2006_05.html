<h3 class="title">O'Reilly Safari Lookup from Amazon Greasemonkey Script</h3>

<p>Another stopgap arising from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006569.html">Amazon wishlist/O'Reilly integration to do item</a> posted earlier today, here are a couple of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> scripts that do <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">Library lookup like</a> things for the <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari e-book bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safarilookup.user.js">Safari Lookup</a><br />
<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safarilookupOU.user.js">Safari Lookup (via OU libezproxy)</a></p>

<p>Here's the result of <em>both</em> scripts running at the same time (which means they'll also run alongside the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Amazon Library lookup script</a>). The advantage of the OU script is that if you have an OU SAMs authentication cookie set, you get to read the full text without the need to log in...</p>

<p><img alt="safariLookupGM.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safariLookupGM.jpg" width="551" height="430" border="0" /></p>

<p>Looking at that screenshot, I think that a better place to put the link would be by the <em>Availability</em> information.</p>

<p>That's one more to do item, then (along with doing a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006280.html">Google books version</a> and integrating the xISBN functionality into the script (there's a crib available in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</a>, so it shouldn't be too hard to do given a spare half hour or so...))</p>

<h3 class="title">Bittybrowser bookmarklets</h3>

<p>Thinking in part about <a href="http://blog.isotoma.com/2006/05/my_20pence.html">this post</a> from an old friend, re-met at the <a href="">Carson Future of Web Apps Summit</a>, discussing how the Web 2.0 community (new Yahoo front page aside)  that gets the techie bit of it extends about as far as the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> readership, I looked around my own toy apps and realised that most of them are largely incomprehensible to most people.</p>

<p>Which is a shame..</p>

<p>... because I think some of them may be <em>OUseful</em>...</p>

<p>Take bookmarklets - if you know about bookmarklets, you're likely to use them.</p>

<p>If you use Firefox, and you donlt know about them, they're easy enough to install.</p>

<p>If you use IE (on XP SP2 at least) and don't know about bookmarklets, they're so relatively hard to install that you probably won't get to appreciate how useful they can be. (Udell has the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/03/20.html">solution in a screencast</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway - that got me thinking: how easy would it be to get bookmarklets working in <a href="http://bitty.com">Bittybrowser</a>, perhaps as a Bittybrowser customisation, so I could give students the joy of a bookmarklet customised browser without them having to customise their own browser, or download one I had customised for them?</p>

<p>As I'm lazy, and don't really have the time (or let's face it, the skill) to work this out myself, I sent a poorly explained, largely indeciperable email to <a href="http://www.turnstyle.com/bio.asp">Scott Matthews</a>, Bittybrowser's creator, asking if it was possible. He got straight back to me with a 'give me a for instance'.</p>

<p>So here one is: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bittyBookmarklets.html">Can we do Bittybrowser bookmarklets?</a></p>

<h3 class="title">O'Reilly Books Full Text from Amazon? Almost...</h3>

<p>This is just a placeholder post for a half hour (?) hack I don't have time to do just at the moment... <strong>Update:</strong>Safari/Amazon library lookup bookmarklets now added... </p>

<p>As O'Reilly are coming to the OU tomorrow (I think) [internal readers: email c.bailey for info] to talk about their <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a> electronic book service  - which even has its own <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?mode=file&file=html/SafariLabs1">labs</a>! - and their <a href="http://safariu.oreilly.com/">SafariU build-you-own-textbook service</a> I wondered about how they reference their ebooks in a URL, and whether it was URL based.</p>

<p>Well, it is... though to see the book text you need a subscription (which we have via the library of course...): for example, <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId=0596102356">this book</a> (the 'free' page is <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId=0596102356">here</a>).</p>

<p>Now, you can also get hold of book ISBNs in an <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">Amazon wishlist feed</a> (I have one of these feeds driving  a Firefox live bookmark) which has given me the idea of a <em>live booklist</em>... </p>

<p>Take one <strong>Amazon wishlist feed</strong>, to which I post O'Reilly books that interest me (perhaps I could scrape the publisher info from the ISBN and use a mixed publisher wishlist?), add a dash of <strong>libezproxy</strong> (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">here</a>) and republish as an feed. Consume as a <strong>live bookmark</strong>.</p>

<p>The user model is then this: I see a Safari book I like on Amazon, I add it to my Amazon O'Reilly wishlist, and then can pick up the full text of the book via a link fed to a live bookmark in my browser...</p>

<p>PS I hadn't noticed this at first:<br />
<blockquote>Safari  is an e-reference library where you can search across thousands of books from O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley, Cisco Press, Microsoft Press and more. Read books cover to cover or flip directly to the section you need in seconds.</blockquote></p>

<p>You can also search within books, and even with code fragments contained in the books:</p>

<p><img alt="oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" width="180" height="376" border="0" /></p>

<p>As it's lunchtime, here's a 5 minute hack/reversion of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Udell's library lookup bookmarklet scheme</a> - a 'public' <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari Library lookup</a> bookmarklet, and a libezproxified one: <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari (OU) Library lookup</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>I'll try and remember to add this to my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">University Challenge - Growing Your Audience</h3>

<p>When it was originally founded, the Open University mission was in part to take Higher Education to the people other HEI's couldn't reach - from the start, our mission was a one of widening particpation. In recent years, <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/">widening participation</a> has become a matter of general concern across the HE sector as a whole, as well as focussing attention <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/widening-participation/">even within the OU</a> (internal readers can check out the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/cwp/">Centre for Widening Particpation</a>, for example).</p>

<p>Faced with this competition for attracting students from various minority (and even majority) groups, I wonder if there is another target group for <em>widening participation</em> that is emerging as a result of <em>lifelong learning</em> inititatives.</p>

<p>To step back for a minute, one of the aims of widening participation is to make Higher Education available to people who, for whatever reason, haven't had the opportunity or encouragement to benefit from it.</p>

<p>So what's the potentially missing group? How about lifelong learners who would benefit from a <em>continued</em> relationship with Higher Education throughout their lifetime. What I'm thinking of here are people who need - or would just like - to either maintain current awareness in, or benefit from enrichment of,  a particular subject area, source a continual programme of knowledge or skills updating (either work or leisure related) or even (!) learn about new subject areas.</p>

<p>(Note that there is a difference in kind between learners who are graduates compared with students who are new to HE - the level of their study skills (graduates <em>should</em> require less study skills training!) so perhaps invoking this audience as a candidate for WP is not really appropriate...)</p>

<p>There are post-undergraduate options available to learners , of course - second degrees, higher  (Masters level) degrees and CPD (Continuing Professional Development) courses (here's the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/cpd/">OU scheme</a>, for example), of which the CPD courses are perhaps the most suited to lifelong learning.</p>

<p>But what I have in mind is more of a subscription model to learning, akin to subscribing to a news feed. For example, several OU courses are exploring the use of course team blogs in part for <em>enrichment</em> of courses. This is not something that has been a major feature of standalone OU courses to date, but it is something that is in the air at the moment. One of the opportunities that arises from enrichment (and news related) topics in a course blog is that they are meaningful to a wider audience, such as the course alumni. So for students who are actually <em>interested</em> in the subject matter of the courses they have done, what I'd like to imagine is that they maintain their feed subscriptions when they finish the course (and pehaps graduate with a feedrool/blogroll  that incorporates feeds from at least some of the courses they have studied).</p>

<p>This model - that gettting students to subscribe to a course feed - is part of a longer play that extends way beyond the time the student actually spends on a particular course. And this in turn should perhaps make us question <em>how</em> we would want students to subscribe to feeds when they first start a course:</p>

<p>- if the feed is delivered seemlessly in a course area of the VLE, why would students take a subscription away at the end of the course? </p>

<p>- if the feed is delivered seemlessly to a personal area of the VLE, with automatic subscription to the feed when the student starts the course, but requires them to unsubscribe when they no longer want it (and perhaps they aren't allowed to unsubscribe till they finish/withdraw form the course?;-) then why would they take the feed away when they graduate? (Perhaps we'd give then an OPML file when they leave?)</p>

<p>- if the students have to subscribe to the feed in a personal feedreader, outside the VLE, most won't...</p>

<p>As well as maintaining a relationship with its own graduates, I wonder too how an HEI might go about pitching for the lifelong learners who graduated from elsewhere, but for whom consuming  top-up, or even just enrichment, educational materials represents just another part of their everday media consumption habit.</p>

<p>For example, think of a degree programme as like a TV season (i.e. a bunch of related programming that a channel hopes will retain it's audeince). How do channels (i.e. HEIs) a) retain audience; and b) steal audience from other channels?</p>

<p>Posting on <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2006/05/the_changing_me.html">The changing media business model</a>, Forrester's <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/">Charlene Li</a> observes:</p>

<blockquote>But what I think best typifies News.com's unique approach is their "Extra" section. It started as "More News From Around The Web" where the editors selected top stories from other sites. It's evolved into a place where you can read about tech stories from all around the Web, even if CNET's News.com isn't covering it. So there's an article wireless technology from Business 2.0, and a story on Steve Ballmer's comments on Vista includes a link to the News.com story, as well as links to stories from competitors like TechNewsWorld, PCWorld, and Wired News.

<p>That's akin to The New York Times linking to the New York Post, The San Francisco Chronicle linking to The San Jose Mercury News, and dare I say it, Forrester linking to Jupiter or Gartner! But if you take the social computing view that as a publisher, you can't serve ALL of the needs of your customer yourself, then the best that you should do is to be the FIRST source of information for your audience. In that way, News.com ensures that although it may not be the ONLY source of technology news, it has a fighting chance of filtering and aggregating that news for its audience better than anyone else. </blockquote></p>

<p>Hmm...so we need compelling content, and we need to be willing to link outside.</p>

<p>Is the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">Open Content Initiative</a> a candidate for this I wonder? I guess that very much depends on the extent to which they develop the social portal aspect of it...</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Feedrolled Persistent Federated Search</h3>

<p>On Friday, I had a quick tinker with the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006462.html">Persistent News Search OPML FeedRoller</a> and added a couple of links from it that already exist in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006101.html">Social Bookmarking Feedroller</a> - e.g. links to an OPML2PDF service, and an online OPML file for each profile. As a proof of concept, I also added an embedded OPML viewer (<a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/">Optimal</a> into the page  (please don't hammer this - I haven't had chance to install my own copy of the viewer onto a local server so it's being called from <a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/">http://optimalbrowser.com/</a> at the moment):</p>

<p><img alt="optimal.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimal.jpg" width="659" height="407" border="0" /></p>

<p>The results from each feed can also be viewed:</p>

<p><img alt="optimalView.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimalView.jpg" width="446" height="209" border="0" /></p>

<p>What the viewer does is allow you to inspect the feeds returned from each profile within the OPML feedroller page.</p>

<p>Now this was v easy to do, and it has got me thinking about how easy it is to cobble together federated search engines when easy to use interfaces exist. (I'm still waiting for a Z39.50 to RSS service to appear somewhere, but in the meantime I'll just have to keep trawling for OpenSearch interfaces.)</p>

<p>So - here are three things I'm going to be mulling over, over the next few days:</p>

<p>- OPML feedrolled persistent searches viewed in Optimal;<br />
- <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006428.html">history searching</a>; and<br />
- searches over socially bookmarked sites (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005877.html">deliSearch</a>).</p>

<p>All of these are potentially sensitive to the user - either helping you rediscover things you've seen, or thought memorable in the past - or allowing you to set up persistent searches in collections/over sources you trust.</p>

<p>And the idle question I'll have in mind to start things off will be whether these sorts of thing may be useful for students, and if so where, and  how we'd make the search box available, and perhaps more importantly, how we'd make the search <em>results</em> available.</p>

<p>PS if you want to try the persistent news search with embedded viewer, there's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsFeedsOPMLFeedBlenderC.html">demo here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Towards a Global Online University</h3>

<p>The following has just appeared on the <a href="https://intranet.open.ac.uk/oulife/news/index.asp#8949">OU intranet News site</a>, which looks like being a really interesting event (I've seen a speaker list, but don't think it's public yet... interesting line up though (more when I can...)):</p>

<blockquote>Monday 5 June 2006, Berrill Lecture Theatre, Walton Hall, 10.30-13.00.

<p>The Forum will hear short presentations by thought leaders from Amazon, Nokia and the BBC, amongst others, to help us consider "Towards a Global Online University: Future Scenarios for Delivering Higher Education". An open discussion session will follow.</p>

<p>Your insights and questions are sought on topics including the design of next generation ICT, novel business models for HE in an internetworked world, and trends and advances in pedagogy, both online and offline.</p>

<p>Video-conferencing facilities will be available in the regions and the event will be webcast via <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill">Stadium</a>.</blockquote></p>

<p>If you have OU SAMS access, you can submit questions or comments in advance via a link on the Stadium webpage.</p>

<p>Just in passing, I've been Googling <em>towards global online university site:open.ac.uk</em> for a bit in the hope of posting about this event as soon as it was out there (but hey, it's Friday, and the intranet news site is almost public...), and was amused to get more than a few references to this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/johndanielspeeches/HKCAA.htm">TOWARDS THE GLOBAL E-UNIVERSITY: QUALITY OR MEDIOCRITY?</a></p>

<p>a talk from December, 2000, by our <em>previous</em> VC, which I think developed some of the ideas introduced briefly in this artcle from March of that year: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/johndanielspeeches/Open_Eye_March_2000.htm">Towards a Global e-OU</a>.</p>

<p>The UK e-University has of course recently been finally laid to rest. And as it's Friday, I just can't resist <em>not</em> posting this any more:</p>

<p><img alt="eUnivError.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/eUnivError.jpg" width="616" height="214" border="0" /></p>

<p>(We all know what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_error">404</a> is, right? When I checked out that Wikipedia link, I couldn't help but chuckle again at the thought that this error code is sometimes returned when a server is <em>configured not to fulfill the request and not reveal the reason why.</em>...! And for some reason, politics came to mind;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Persistent News Search OPML Feed Roller</h3>

<p>I had a bit of a dabble with the code of my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPMLFeedBlender.html">social bookmarking OPML feed roller</a> last week, trying to make it easier to register new socail bookmarking systems, so to see how easy it would be generate a different sort of OPML feed roller, Ive just had a quick hack and commenty of the code to produce a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsFeedsOPMLFeedBlender.html">persistent news search OPML feed roller</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="newsOPML.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsOPML.jpg" width="582" height="591" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's what it looks like if you import this OPML into the <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a> feed reader extension for Firefox:</p>

<p><img alt="newsOPMLSage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsOPMLSage.jpg" width="347" height="212" border="0" /></p>

<p>When I get a chance, I'll go in and tidy the code up... that is, unless I get distracted by a tweak to let the user structure the feeds by search engine, rather than (or as well as?) 'profile'.</p>

<h3 class="title">Not Beta, But Gamma or Delta?</h3>

<p>Half-listening to <a href="http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/05/01/episode-6-sphere-launch/">a recent episode of TalkCrunch</a> on my commmute to work today, there was a brief discussion about 35-40 mins in to the podcast that the web 2.0 way was <em>not</em> to release beta software in the sense of  'feature complete, but potentially buggy' code, but instead to release early and often, function incomplete but useable applications, and then work towards feature completion during the beta phase.</p>

<p>So is this really beta testing? Or should we coin a new variant designation? Next in the alphabet is gamma, I think, then delta.</p>

<p>Delta's interesting - in many sciences it refers to a small change in quantity (so perhaps this is a release phase with regular 0.0.1 version increments?).</p>

<p>But this breaks the alphabetic progression. So how's about redesignating the web 2.0 style beta as a gamma release, where the users might expect stability in operation, but potentially regular and even significant feature upgrades?</p>

<p>Then when the app comes out of gamma, it can go into a period of delta progression, tiny tweaks and fixes until the next round of private alpha, limited beta and then public gamma releases that will culminate in the next version up, 'stable delta' release?</p>

<p>(I'm not computer software engineer, so perhaops gamma and delta releases are already recognised?)</p>

<p>Every couple of months I pop over to <a href="http://flock.com">flock.com</a> to see how the Flock 'social browser' is coming on. In fact, uit seems like it's almost ready to go to beta (hopefully in the next few weeks) so it'll be interesting to see what the take up is.</p>

<p>If you haven't tried, seen or even read about Flock, it's builit on top for the Firefox code base but with lots of in-built customisations and extensions that support all sorts of social behaviour - Flickr photo-sharing, social bookmarking, blogging and so on.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I particulary liked when I tried Flock out today was the <em>search browser history</em> option.</p>

<p><img alt="flockHistorySearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/flockHistorySearch.jpg" width="266" height="251" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you type your search terms in the browser search box <em>and don't hit return</em> a pop-up menu appears with links to pages in your browser history that are hits for the search term. (The effect is <a href="http://wiki.flock.com/index.php?title=Search_bar">described here</a>.)</p>

<p>Now this functionality is something I've been after for a long time, though I've had glimpses of it from Google search history, Yahoo! MyWeb 2.0, various desktop search tools, and Simpy search, and I;m not sure but it mayu well turn out to be a bit like tabbed browsing - once you've tried it for a day or too, there's now way you'd want to give it up.</p>

<p>The search works because there's a search engine (<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>) built into the Flock browser itself, which is a really neat move. Along with the web service handlers that are embedded within the Firefox code (e.g. here's how to call a SOAP service using the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/synd/2002/08/30/mozillasoapapi.html?page=1">Firefox/Mozilla web service API</a>) allwe need now is a lite internal server...</p>

<p>In fact, that's just got me thinking - would it be neat if there were programmer extensions that provide easy to use hooks and handlers for the various public APIs that are now available? Flock makes use of some of these already, of course - e.g. the APIs for Flickr, delicious and Blogger, to name just three - but would it also be useful to provide a mapping extension to allow users to easily embed Google maps in simple self-coded browser apps (or kisok apps)? Or an eBay or Amazon toolkit built into the browser? Or a <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">Paypal API</a> enhanced <em>point of sale (POS)</em> browser for kiosk use, perhaps? Hmm..I dunno - maybe need to think this through a bit more...</p>

<p>PS For some reason delicious via the web has been really slow for me lately (perhaps it's all my bookmarks) so now I do virtually all my delicious bookmarking from my Firefox <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Perfomancing extension</a> (PFF): </p>

<p><img alt="deliciousPFF.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliciousPFF.jpg" width="641" height="275" border="0" /></p>

<p>That's in addition to blogging from the PFF, of course :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Google/Yahoo/Amazon Certified Professionals...</h3>

<p>A couple of days ago (or was it just yesterday?) I posted on the topic of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006381.html">Google Certified Professionals</a> as consultants who could go into SMEs and deliver training on getting a Google (or Windows Live etc.) web appliction office suite up and running. But it struck me that there may also be a need certification in the use of the code toolkits produced by the major webco's.</p>

<p>For example, Yahoo recently just announced an <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/05/09/autocomplete-windowing-menu-and-more-a-second-beta-release-for-the-yui-library/">update</a> to their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">User Interface Code and Design Pattern Library</a>, which gives you industrial strength based widgets and CSS tricks. Now I know there are lots of toolkits out there, but the old saying goes that no-one ever got fired for buying IBM... </p>

<p>I wonder if there is potential in the future for saying that no-one ever got fired for using the example.com libraries?</p>

<p>And then last night Google announced the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a> a Java coding environment with AJAX/JS code generation and whole lot more (early review <a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/05/16/445/">here</a>).</p>

<p>If I was Microsoft, I'd be getting twitchy. Surely Google can't be making a play to steal business from Microsoft's programming tools product line (speaking of which, there are <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/downloads.aspx">Community Technology Previews</a> of Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/default.mspx"><em>Expression</em></a> web development product line currently available).<br />
<h2>Amazon Certified Professional</h2></p>

<p>Finally, I guess I should float the idea of an <em>Amazon Certified Professional</em> or <em>eBay Certified Professional</em> scheme which would certify the user as being competent at programming the APIs of the company in question.</p>

<p>(The Google Certified Professional would thus require three flavours of Certification: web application advice and training; expertise in using Google code libraries; and expertise in Google API programming.)</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> this is related too: <em>"The <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> will be the first in a series of third-party AJAX components for GUI, communication, and data access that will be made available to users of <a href="http://tibco.com/software/ria/default.jsp">TIBCO General Interface</a> later this year."</em> Ref: <a href="http://tibco.com/company/news/releases/press732.jsp">TIBCO Press Release</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Amazon-Supported Library Services</h3>

<p>Whilst chatting to Gill Needham in the OU Library last week about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Library Amazon script</a>, and a  'gold plated service' <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005517.html">delivering library books direct to people's pigeon-holes</a>*, Gill mentioned in passing whether there was any opportunity in using the Amazon catalogue in place of our public facing library catalogue. I've been mulling this over tonight, and consdiered the flipside - what if we use the library catalogue as a front end to Amazon?</p>

<p>[*Apparently, the library provides library services to the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/loans/regstaff.html">OU regional offices/academics</a>, and also <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/al_services.html">ALs</a> (the latter via a <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/al_services.html#postal">postal loans service</a>. Many ALs are employed in their own local HEIs, of course, so they don't really need to call on the OU library for books (not least because the collection is rather small, and  - err, how to say this - a bit quirky ;-) (That said, we do have an impressive <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources.html">e-library collection</a>, which is also available to ALs (and registered students...)) Nevertheless, for regional staff at least, the opportunity is there to have books pulled of the shelf in Milton Keynes and shipped up to the regional office.]</p>

<p>The idea (of using a library catalogue as an Amazon interface) may well have merit, it seems, as this precedent from the <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey+libraries+and+Amazon.co.uk?opendocument">Surrey library service</a> demonstrates:</p>

<blockquote>You can now buy items from Amazon.co.uk though the library catalogue and help to support your local library service into the bargain!

<p>Every title listed in the libraries' online catalogue of more than 400,000 books now has a link to the Amazon.co.uk website. Many of the links in the catalogue lead straight to the relevant page on Amazon so if you find that the book you want isn't in stock at your local library, buying it is just a click away.</blockquote></p>

<p><img alt="surreyLibrary.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/surreyLibrary.jpg" width="418" height="484" border="0" /></p>

<p>(Here's the <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/comm/Press.nsf/99c17debf90c17f064256bc7005b99bd/9b18aa9e269bc0c680256f74005dd3f2?OpenDocument">press release</a> and here's a <a href="http://www.surreylibraries.org/cgi-bin/surrey.sh">link to the Surrey Libraries catalogue</a> if you want to try it out (an Amazon link is on each book's details page:-)</p>

<p>Now, there are several things that spin off the idea of using the library catalogue as a front end to the Amazon catalogue.</p>

<p>Firstly, we get a piece of the pie whenever someone buys a book by registering as an <a href="http://associates.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join/main.html/203-2691911-6099905">Amazon Associate</a>**.</p>

<p>[**I did raise this once, somewhere internal, with respect to the sale of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/about/setbooks/">set books</a> to students (there's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">OUseful Amazon Greasemonkey script</a> for this page of course...;-) Apparently, that's not possible, because we<a href="http://www.booksellers.org.uk/ou/">play fair</a>.]</p>

<p>Secondly, the Library's in the fulfilment business, just like Amazon. If a user's needs can be satisifed more quickly, directly, and cheaply, by getting the book out of the library, why not get the book from the library?</p>

<p>Thirdly, there must be a cost associated with getting books either via inter-library loans or posting them up to regional staff. I don't know how the library decides whether to buy a book that has been requested as an inter-library loan (presumably one factor would be the likelihood of it ever being borrowed again?! a factor which might be reflected by the Amazon sales rank?) but if a decision is made to ILL it at a cost greater than the purchase price of the book***, then wouldn't it be sensible to suggest to the patron that they buy the book for themself on a budget code funded via Library internal transfer/rebate to their Faculty? Especially if the Library also took a cut as an Associate (hmm - this may breach the Associate agreement)? And double especially if the book then found itself onto the patron's <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelf</a> - which would of course be linked into the Library catalogue (and I suppose Amazon, too) via a Greasemonkey script;-)</p>

<p>[***this will come through the on the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Feedburner feed</a> as a <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">delicious feedthru</a> item, but  if you haven't moved your subscription to this blog there yet, here's a taste of what you're missing out on:<br />
<em><a href="http://www.wishlistbuddy.com">WIshlist Buddy</a>: A really neat little web app that lets you set a target price for your Amazon wishlist items. When Amazon discounts the price of the item to a level at or below your target price, it sends you an alert.</em>]</p>

<p>Fourthly, the Library would be able to satisfy more user requests (?hmm ;-) - at the very least, seeing what books people were going to Amazon for because the library couldn't satisfy them, might usefully inform the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/collections/collections_develop.html">Collections Development Policy</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, it would also be possible to call on the Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html">web service API</a> to give a list of links to other books that people who bought the book in question on Amazon also bought... One reason you might want to do this is to refer people to other books <em>in the library system</em> that are related the book currently under inspection. (Again, this would provide data to the collection development group).</p>

<p>And why use Amazon's 'people who bought...' data rather than our own 'people who borrowed this also borrowed that' data? Well, I seem to recall Paul Miller touched on this when he <a href="http://paulmiller.typepad.com/thinking_about_the_future/2006/04/the_open_univer.html">talked at the OU</a> - the long tail... given the size of the our library userbase, the populations are so small that it's quite likely that the data will give some very peculiar results indeed!</p>

<p>In contrast, the volume of purchases going through Amazon on even unpopular titles are likely to be statistically more robust, and hence more likely to result in sensible recommendations.)</p>

<p>It's also possible to imagine an architectural enforcement of a policy to use the Library catalogue as an Amazon gateway for users on campus - anyone trying to look up something on Amazon from the OU network could be redirected to the library catalogue, staff <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelves</a> or Club <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouclub/cdlibrary/">CD library</a> ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Certified Professional</h3>

<p>WIth the increasing numbers of (free) web based office productivity tools, as well as Microsoft and Google's moves <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">towards hosting academic email accounts</a>, I wonder when we'll start seeing <em>Google Certified Professionals</em> (in addition to their <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/professionalwelcome">Google Advertising Pofessionals</a>) lending sage advice to SMEs about how to get the most from <a href="http://mail.google.com">GMail</a>, the <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>, <a href="http://writely.com">Writely</a> and so on? (<strong>Update:</strong> err, oops, that's in addition to promoting best <em>search</em> practice of course (which we'll be doing in <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120  Beyond Google</a>!))</p>

<p>This needn't be limited to Google of course - the Microsoft Live product suite continues to roll out, and the other member of the GYM - Yahoo - also provide comprehensive email and calendaring facilities. Which suggests the need, perhaps, for an 'independent web office applications advisor' who can take you through the vagaries of selecting an appropriate mix of online tools, as well as providing the training necessary to use them effectively.</p>

<p>(For a 'free' independent advisor model, I guess there'd have to be a level playing field in terms of <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/referrals">referral payments</a>?)</p>

<p>I suspect this is not the sort of thing covered in our new <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T121_8_0">Information and Communication Technologies at Work (T121)</a> course, but I wonder - is there a place for it someone in our level 1 offering?</p>

<p>The changing landscape also reminds me of the OU course <a href="http://t171.open.ac.uk/info/">T171 You, Your Computer and the Net: Learning and Living in the Computer Age</a> which met a real need at the turn of the millenium helping people get online and providing basic web literacy skills.</p>

<p>(This course has largely been superceded by <a href="http://t175.open.ac.uk/">T175 Networked Living: Exploring Information and Communication Technologies</a> and several courses on the <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge Technology Short Course Programme</a>.)</p>

<p>With the promise of social software, feed based subscription, pushed content, synchronisation of data between web applications and mobile devices, and effective collaborative online working, I wonder whether there is an opportunity for <em>T171.1 - Making the Net Work for You</em>?</p>

<p>And another couple of years down the line, when the penetration of broadband has increased a bit more and institutions like the BBC (but not, I suspect, the OU;-) will be making ever increasing amounts of multimedia content available for download, I suspect there'll be another opportunity, educating people how to make the most of their digital pipes.</p>

<p>PS have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4339519.stm"><em>digital plumbing services</em></a> started appearing in the Yellow Pages yet, I wonder?</p>

<h3 class="title">An Aside on SOAP vs. REST</h3>

<p><em>An aside</em>, becusue this post is little more than a quote from <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/">Justin Leavesley</a>: but it captures very well my own take on webservices and the SOAP vs. REST debate:</p>

<blockquote>Clayton [in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=robofestauk-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=blended%26keyword=the%20innovaotrs%20dilemma">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>] also describes what he terms as "Disruptive Innovation" of which one type is the low-end disruption. This is where a technically inferior innovation radically reduces the barrier(be that skill, cost or location) to entry thereby allowing an audience that was previously excluded to participate. This competes on new dimensions with a new audience.

<p>This massive new audience is currently excluded from the traditional solution so the disruptive innovation only competes against being better than nothing for this audience.</p>

<p>So disruptive innovation allows a new, less skilled community to participate and do new kinds of things. Almost by definition this community is larger than the community of experts i.e. it is the long tail.</p>

<p>If we consider REST we see that it is not technically as advanced as SOAP based Web Services. But it is significantly easier with lower skill and cost barriers for both producer and consumer. And sure enough Amazon and others are finding that the vast majority of the users of their platform are using the REST APIs. </blockquote> <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2006/05/web_services_and_the_innovator.php">http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2006/05/web_services_and_the_innovator.php</a></p>

<p>One question for me is how we reflect this in HE, for example in our teaching about webservices? In business related web services, SOAP, WSDL, and business standard schemas like BPEL  and BPMLare presumably the things we should be teaching our students to prepare them for a life in industry (for a good review on web services, see <a href="http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00000586/01/mike.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p>But should this be at the expense of teaching playground hacks with RESTful APIs?</p>

<p>Where does the happy balance lie?</p>

<h3 class="title">The Scarey World of Search...</h3>

<p>A couple of days ago, I wanted to find a podcast on <a href="http://itconversations.com"></a> that I'd heard earlier in the week and downloaded automatically via my <a href="http://www.podnova.com">PodNova</a> client.</p>

<p>The podcast was by Tim O'Reilly, and in it he mentioned how he had spoken about von Kempelen's Mechanical Turk in a presentation at Amazon, and riffed about how people inside the software machine could be likened to the Mechanical Turk in some ways (he also idly wondered whether this in any way informed the naming of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/102-5391039-6545756?node=15879911">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway - I didn't have a link for the podcast, just the knowledge that it came from IT Conversations. the only problem is, if you search for Tim O'Reilly there, you get loads of hits - and I didn't know which one was the one I wanted. </p>

<p>But it seems that the IT conversations has a new search button alongside the 'search text' link - <em>search audio</em> - so I searched for <em>mechanical turk</em> and was rewarded with <a href="http://www.podscope.com/search.php?q=mechanical+turk&sourceID=19&sa.x=16&sa.y=17">a perfect, unique hit</a>.</p>

<p>Gulp....</p>

<p>(Just in passing, I also noticed that IT Conversations let you link from a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail142.html">show page</a> to up to two minute excerpts from their content: so here's <a href="http://www.itconversations.com//clip.php?showid=142&start=12:45&stop=14:00">Tom O'Reilly on the Mechanical Turk</a>.)</p>

<p>(In a weird twist, many podcast subscription services use the Mechanical Turk to <a href="http://www.broadcasting20.org/2006/03/15/podcast-transcripts-and-the-mechanical-turk/">pay people to transcribe podcasts</a> (here's <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2005/12/walking_through.html">how it works</a>).</p>

<p>So why's this scarey? I was just suddenly taken aback by what we can now search for. Podcasts are increasingly becoming searchable,as the above shows (as well as things like <a href="http://www.podzinger.com/">Podzinger</a>).</p>

<p>And as a colleague -Jon Rosewell  - pointed out, the Podscope search is itself quite scarey, drawing as it does on a service provided by <a href="http://www.tveyes.com/">TVeyes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Real Time Radio & TV Monitoring</strong>

<p>TVEyes is the first company to deliver real-time TV and Radio search across multiple languages on an international platform. Services are provided to a wide range of users in both consumer and professional markets including Government and Law Enforcement Agencies. The company uses a range of proprietary technologies to index audio feeds that allow Radio and TV to be searched by keyword - just as you would use a search engine for text.<br />
[...]<br />
The technology underlying the Company's products involve a combination of proprietary software, third party products and customized hardware used to capture, index, analyze, archive and distribute in real - time content captured from television and radio broadcasts.<br />
The process of broadcast capture, analysis and distribution is achieved virtually in real time.<br />
The underlying technology can also be applied to any audio signal or archive allowing for its deployment in the field of telephony.</blockquote></p>

<p>Add in something like <a href="http://www.shazam.com/music/portal/">Shazam</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In the UK, Shazam operates under it's own brand, and allows customers to dial 2580 on their mobile phone and identify any track using their mobile handset. Users hold their phone to the music for 10 to 15 seconds while Shazam identifies the track using a process based on unique 'fingerprints' and immediately sends the user an SMS with the name of the artist and song title.

<p>Having received the music recognition result, users can then choose to buy associated products (ringtones, full track music, wallpapers etc), find out more about the track or artist on the WAP portal, or simply store the text message for future reference.</p>

<p>To use Shazam's music recognition service, customers do not need any additional hardware or software for their mobile phone, and no user registration is required. Shazam works in the UK across all operators (Vodafone, Orange, T-Mobile, O2, Virgin and 3), and on all handsets.</blockquote></p>

<p>and even more of the audible world becomes searchable.</p>

<p>And then there are things like <a href="http://riya.com/">Riya</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Our face recognition technology automatically tags people in photos so you can search for just the photo you want. In your albums. In your friends' albums. In our public albums.</blockquote>

<p>And is this where we're heading?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.slibe.com/images/74093e76-googlein20years_.jpg" /></p>

<p>Possibly - in the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html">Internet of Things</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Google Books Lookup Script</h3>

<p>As I slowly working through the set, here's a follow up to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Library Amazon Greasemonkey Script</a> based on a direct reworking from a script by Edward Vielmetti (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a>) that does a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/02/inserting_libra.html">library lookup on books viewed in Google Books</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googlebooksOU.user.js">OU/Google Books Library Lookup Script </a></p>

<p>And here's an example lookup:</p>

<p><img alt="googleBooksLookup.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleBooksLookup.jpg" width="707" height="159" border="0" /></p>

<p>Just in passing, I heard from an internal reader this week who mentioned having actually got a book out of the OU library as a result of using the Amazon library lookup script:-)</p>

<p>It seems to me, the next thing to do would be to do a script to annotate somone's Amazon wishlist. </p>

<p>However, rather than doing this on an Amazon page, I'm tempted to create a bespoke page, or perhaps a feed, that will flag Wishlist items that are in the Library (or perhaps books that are on a <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelf</a> somewhere (described briefly <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005948.html">here</a>...;-)</p>

<p>And the source of the wishlist info? Why, a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">Amazon wishlist feed</a>, of course!</p>

<h3 class="title">TIme for a New Game? Google Trend Match</h3>

<p>Today <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/yes-we-are-still-all-about-search.html">Google announced four new services</a> (though one of them - the Google Notebook, a web clipping, note sharing tool - isn't available yet).</p>

<p>Another is 'old hat' - the <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a>, although it does come with <a href="http://googledesktop.blogspot.com/2006/05/say-hello-to-google-gadgets.html">Google gadgets</a> (beating Microsoft to the desktop with that name - <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/">Microsoft gadgets</a> won't be coming to the desktop until Vista is released, I believe). It'll be interesting to see if the Google Gadgets differ from <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo/Konfabulator widgets</a> to any significant degree.</p>

<p>The third  -<a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google Coop</a> I don;t grok at all yet, and need to think about a bit...</p>

<p>And the fourth? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a>, a tool for showing a sample of "how many searches have been done for the terms you enter relative to the total number of searches done on Google over time".</p>

<p>Along with <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/press/zeitgeist.html">Google Zeitgeist</a> this looks like it may be interesting for our new course on info skills - <a href="ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beoyond Google: Working WIth Information Online</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of screenshots to give you a flavour of what the service offers:</p>

<p> - firstly, a search on the term 'blair ' - notice how some peaks are correlated with particular stories. It'll be interesting to see how the filters that deliver these annotations are tuned over time:</p>

<p><img alt="googleTrendBlair.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleTrendBlair.jpg" width="849" height="414" border="0" /></p>

<p>- secondly, a comparison chart between two terms (you can actually compare up to five):</p>

<p><img alt="googleTrendShuttleNasa.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleTrendShuttleNasa.jpg" width="845" height="408" border="0" /></p>

<p>I really hope this becomes the basis of a game to rival <a href="http://www.googlewhack.com/">Googlewhacking</a> - <em>GoogleLike</em>  - where you have to find two or more apparently independent terms that are either correlated or anti-correlated. (so we need a correlation rank score for the traces...any chance of the Lazyweb coming up with a Greasemonkey script to do this?;-)</p>

<p>And finally, an example of how the traces can be used to demonstrate the emergence of a whole new area of interest (<em>Library 2.0</em> in this case) out of nowhere:</p>

<p><img alt="googleTrendLibrary2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleTrendLibrary2.jpg" width="621" height="418" border="0" /></p>

<p>Next stop: perhaps I ought to find out what the blog stats people offer?</p>

<h3 class="title">Testing Javascript Includes...</h3>

<p>A quick look at the clock showed I'd missed lunch (again!) so here's the outcome of 20 mins of playtime scratching an itch I've had for a bit: how to test Javascript functions that pull content into your web page, like delicious bookmarks or <a href="http://metaatem.net/words/">flickr spellings</a> (which will render words using letter photographs from flickr), without having to edit a test file.</p>

<p>What do I mean - well, if you look at the flickr spellings page, it will generate a snippet of HTML code that will pull a Javascript function into your page that will spell  out a word using Flickr letter images.</p>

<p>If they had provided written instructions about how to embed the code in you page, they may have written something like:</p>

<p>"To include this spelling in your page insert the following piece of javascript where you want the image to appear:<br />
<em>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://metaatem.net/spell.php?picsize=t&string=OUseful"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em></p>

<p>My itch was - if I see that sort of instruction, how could I quickly test the effect?</p>

<p>Well, here are a couple of attempts:</p>

<p> - a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/jsIncludeTest.html">simple web page</a> that lets you put in the URL of a Javascript include, like <em>http://metaatem.net/spell.php?picsize=t&string=OUseful</em>, for example, and it'll then load the script into the browser for you so you can try it out. It sort of works (but now how I wanted it to). Instead, I prefer:</p>

<p> - an <a href="javascript:d=document;t=d.selection?d.selection.createRange().text:d.getSelection();void(window.open('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/jsIncludeTest.php?js='+escape(t)))">insert this JS</a> bookmarklet that will let you highlight a URL that is used within a Javascript include file, (like <em>http://metaatem.net/spell.php?picsize=t&string=OUseful</em> or <em>http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/psychemedia/opml</em>)  and which will then load a test page that includes that file. (For some reason, this bookmarklet doesn't appear to work from inside the page (i.e. by clicking on the link in this page) - you need to actually use it as a bookmarklet from the browser toolbar for it to work.)</p>

<p>The bookmarklet makes a call to a script which in minimal from looks like this:</p>

<p><em>&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Script test&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
&lt;?php<br />
if (isset($_GET['js']) )<br />
 print '&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="'.$_GET['js'].'" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;';<br />
?&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;</em><br />
</p>

<h3 class="title">If We Really Had Global Pretensions for Web2.OU...</h3>

<p>...we'd have someone involved in <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">Wax</a>, wouldn't we? (After all, Higher Education is now an industry, isn't it?)</p>

<p>(The main reason I'm blogging this is to keep a record of the <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">list of attendees</a>, just in case...)</p>

<p>And just by the by - here's a handy list of what I guess is a large part of the UK 'web 2.0 developer community' - the <a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/webapps/member/index.cgi?attendee_list">list of attendees from the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Carson Systems' <em>Future of Web Apps</em> Summit</a>. (NB Podcasts of presentations from the Summit are available. If you weren't there, they're worth a listen...)</p>

<p>As this is turning into a link post, here's some more workshop related stuff that looks like it may be interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/ucisa-ukoln-cetis-2006/handouts/">Handouts</a> from the UCISA/UKOLN/CETIS Workshop 2006 on <em>Initiatives & Innovation: Managing Disruptive Technologies</em>.</p>

<p>The forthcoming <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/">Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006: Quality Matters</a> Workshop. As an institution that supports an online student body that I guess peaked at around 200, 000 registered students, and that has committed to requiring all registered students to participate in web based learning activities within the next couple of years, I am always surprised when there is <em>not</em> someone from the OU talking about what we've acheived and how we've made it scale...</p>

<p>Also upcoming is <a href="http://incsub.org/edublog/">blog.ac.uk</a> a conference (or <em>un</em>conference?) which is:</p>

<blockquote>structured around two framework themes. These cut across the educational sectors and are crucial to life-long education provision that meets the needs and abilities of all learners - provision that is vital to empower learners as citizens within multiple communities and in preparing the UK to participate creatively, technologically and economically on a global scale.

<p>1. Deployment of weblogs and related technologies within educational institutions and the learning and teaching environment: navigating risk (morning sessions)</p>

<p>2. Blogging as community practice: impact of weblogs on current and future Personal Learning Environments (afternoon sessions).</blockquote></p>

<p>I hope to go...mail me if you're going and want to meet up.</p>

<h3 class="title">Blogging Academic Lectures</h3>

<p>It's late, I'm tired, but I've just read <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/laptops_in_lectures/">John Dale on <em>Laptops in Lectures</em></a> and it reminded that I meant to post about my experience of <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/laptops_in_lectures/trackback/">blogging the OU Learning and Teaching Conference</a> a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>So, for what it's worth, here's an off the top of my head list that I'll try and tidy up if I get a chance:</p>

<p>1) slides with lots of text on are a killer - you try and read the text, you try and listen to the speaker, you're trying to type notes. Confusion results and the blogging is painful.</p>

<p>2) slides with just a couple of words or a short phrase are a joy - they give you a sub-heading and are easily copied; this leads into:</p>

<p>3) it's easier to type while listening than copying stuff from presentation slides; it's also difficult to type everything the speaker says, so donlt even try; listen for key points, summarise and add short asides/private notes to yourself as well as things to pick up on/develop/challenge.</p>

<p>4) screenshots of websites, and websites demonstrated live, need the URL visible. That way, the audience can play along, take a bookmark and so on. A quick play might also give you inspiration/ammunition for a question;-)</p>

<p>5) In the link mentioned above, John Dale wondered:<br />
<blockquote>t's possible in principle, I suppose, that a wifi–equipped laptop could be useful in allowing the student to look up additional content relating to the lecture via Google or whatever. But I bet nobody actually does this effectively; it would be too difficult to multi–task the searching, the listening and the note–taking.</blockquote><br />
Not necessarily true, though I guess it depends on the nature of the presentation being blogged. John was referring to a lecture, whereas I was in a conference situation.  In one of the sessions I was in, a question was raised from the floor (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006084.html">Chris Pegler</a>) picking up on a point of fact made from the stage after checking it over the net. (I've also been to some conferences where people are IMing real time in a chat room about what's being said from the front. Rude,possibly, but value adding too. Turns the presentation into something more like Speaker's Corner!)</p>

<p>One of the things that comes out from the above is that lectures and conference presentations are perhaps different beasts. But I wonder if the idea of a lecture delivering a litany of facts to receptacle students is another model of communication that will be disrupted by technology and the ease with which students can access linked information (I seem to remember it was always a chore going off to the library for a short library loan... but where's the problem if the paper I need is online?)</p>

<p>In seminars, too, I wonder if having occasional sessions where everyone brings a laptop could be a useful exercise, particularly if the discussion involves ambiguous claims that can be checked (via the web), but often aren't... </p>

<p>(Are political press conferences changing, I wonder, with the press being increasingly able to look up facts and challenge podium claims  - or is wi-fi banned from them?;-)</p>

<p>Anyway - my take home for presenting to bloggers was: go for few and simple words on each slide (these provide cheap and easy subheadings); make URLs known (especially if you don't mind the audience wandering off their. On a couple of occasions, I found it quite enjoyable browsing through a site while the presenter was talking about it, each complementing the other. (Hmmm - there's (here's?!;-) that <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/06/supernova_2005_2.html">partial attention</a> thing raising it's head again (here in the sense I'm minded to go off an have a quick refresher on it, paying attention to revising my notion of partial attention, as well as to finishing this post.  A <em>partial attention aside</em>, no less!) It'd be neat if I could have a <a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/tools/domcollapse/index.html">collapsible element</a> button in Performancing/my blog for this asides...)</p>

<p>Anyway  - back to the main thread. Perhaps not surprisingly, there are some strong similarities in the list of things that I perceived made life easier for me as a blogger of a conference presentation to the things I've been bookmarking as exemplars of <a href+"http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/bestpractice+presentation">presentation+bestpractice</a>. Certainly in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006085.html">my own presentations</a> I've started trying to keep the word count down.</p>

<h3 class="title">Formula One Live Data</h3>

<p>It's Formula One Grand Prix race day, and as I've <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005939.html">mentioned before</a> it's possible to get live timing stiiaght from the <a href="http://www.formula1.com">Formula One website</a> (as well as live Renault drivers' track positions from the <a href="http://www.renaultf1.com">Renault F1</a> site): <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/f1Live.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/f1Live.html','popup','width=962,height=560,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a></p>

<p>Although I haven't been able to find any details from 'official' sources about accessing the live timing (and brief text commentary) data from the F1 site, it seems that someone has reversed engineered it for the <a href="https://launchpad.net/products/live-f1">Live F1 Linux client</a>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things it might be interesting to explore with this information - a live chat client that relays the commentary information could be fun to start with, especially if it was fed from a 'virtual commentator' that automatically generates commentary information based on position changes, whether cars are in the pits and so on ('X has just pitted', 'P is 0.2s slower than Q in sector 2', 'Y had a very quick/slow pit stop' (there are expected times for a pit stop) , 'the safety car has come out' - you get the picture...). </p>

<p>The RoboCup football simulation league has an <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/commentator.pdf">automated commentary</a> challenge associated with it, and many sports based computer games embed automatic commentary systems, so there are plenty of precedents. The 'linear' nature of the F1 race (as compared to the much more loosely structured game of football) means that as an entry clevel hallenge to automatic commentary systems, F1 racing is quite appealing.</p>

<p>It may also be possible to identify progression between the complexity of commentary systems within F1 itself, for example by designing commentary systems for the qualification session and the race day itself.<br />
 <br />
Opening up the data feeds could also provide an ICT outreach element to F1 to support initiatives like <a href="http://www.f1inschools.co.uk/">F1 in Schools</a> and the new <a href="http://emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/article/index.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticle&aoid=140276&coid=88&lang=EN">BMW-Sauber Pit Lane Park</a> (If anyione reading is associated with that, I'd love a free pass in to see it at Silverstone, even before race day;-)</p>

<p>The ICT elements of F1 are potentially a significant resource for ICT outreach - not only are there significant telemetry and GPS aspects that can be exploited (including data and voice comms) there are also significant issues relating to sensor data fusion and analysis within the car itself. F1 is data rich - is it time we put it to educaitonal use?</p>

<h3 class="title">delicious URL Rewrites</h3>

<p>A little while ago, I posted a Firefox bookmarklet to hide items on a delicious links page that bore a particular tag (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005809.html">deliHide</a>). Here's another quick delicious bookmarklet that will do a URL rewrite for you...</p>

<p>What do I mean? Well, if you look at my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/redirects.php">OUseful Redirects</a> page, you'll see a whole load of shortcuts that I dangle off the <em>ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> path that I can use to take me quickly (and via a memeorable URL) to pages that are hard to remember the location of.</p>

<p>For example, the easy <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/txr174</em> will take me straight to the course catalogue page for TXR174 (<em>http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01txr174</em>) which has a less than memorable URL.</p>

<p>The key to this is a <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/urlrewriting.html">URL rewrite</a>. The only problem is that I need to get to the server to be able to add more of these.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> does something similar, although the focus here is on providing a short - if cryptic - URL in place of a long one. You often see TinyURLs in newspaper and magazine articles, for example.</p>

<p>Anyway, tonight's quick hack is a kludged Firefox bookmarklet that will look for a link on a page that is tagged with <em>usr:redirect</em>. As soon as it finds one, it will extract the URL of that <em>usr:redirect</em> tagged page and load it in to the browser window.</p>

<p>Now I know this is an abuse of the tagging system - it encourages single use tags, for example. But it does demonstrate another way of using a social bookmarking system! ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway - for what it's worth - here's my <a href="javascript:(function(){d=document.body;void(el=d.getElementsByTagName('div'));for(i=0;i<el.length;i++){if(el[i].getAttribute('class')){if(el[i].getAttribute('class').indexOf('meta')!=-1){tl=el[i].getElementsByTagName('a');for(j=0;j<tl.length;j++){if(tl[j].firstChild.nodeValue=='usr:redirect'){t1=el[i].parentNode.childNodes[1].childNodes[0];window.location=t1.getAttribute('href')}};};};};})();">deliURLreWrite</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>The real idea, of course, is that this function would be useful in a Greasmonkey script, but I leave that as an exercise for the reader (or until I get another spare quarter of an hour!). Couldn't resist... here it is: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/GMdeliReWrite.user.js">delicious URL rewrite Greasemonkey script</a>. NB you may also want to lock the script down to your delicious username... and remember, if you have a link with a >em>url:redirect</em> tag listed on a page, that's where the page will go as soon as it's loaded (which is actually a bit clunky...) I wonder whether, if there are several <em>usr:redirect</em> tagged links on a page <em>all</em> of them should be opened in separate windows/tabs?</p>

<p>And the purpose of the script? So I could write something like <em>http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/thisPage</em> and get taken (redirected) straight to whatever page (with its horrible and unmemorable URL) I had tagged as <em>thisPage</em>.</p>

<p>So maybe I need a new delicious account turned over solely to URL rewrites? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Importing OPML into IE7</h3>

<p>I just tried to import the structured OPML bookmark feed feed <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006153.html">I posted about last night</a> into IE7 (via the <em>Import Feed</em> option:</p>

<p><img alt="ie7Import.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ie7Import.jpg" width="207" height="130" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="ie7importFeed.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ie7importFeed.jpg" width="481" height="223" border="0" /></p>

<p>and hit a problem - no feeds were imported.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=3b3b882e-a2bd-4b4e-a6b2-dd9337c33e3e">It seems</a> that IE7 requires the <em>type</em> attribute of the relevant <em>outline</em> elements to be set to <em>rss</em> (as in <em>feed="rss"</em>) for the import to work.</p>

<p>So here's yet  another version of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPMLFeedBlender-d.html">Social Bookmarks Structured  OPML Feed Generator</a>, and here's what the example from the previous post in this series looks like when it's imported into IE7:</p>

<h3 class="title">(Social) Bookmark Interoperability</h3>

<p>Some time ago I posted on the topic of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005332.html">Social Bookmarking Interoperability</a>, something I've had cause to look at again several times recently: firstly on the issue of synching bookmarks between users on two different social bookmarking systems (Simpy and delicious); secondly on managing browser bookmark collections, and synching between different browsers and social bookmarking systems; thirdly on the display of bookmark collections in folder based displays.</p>

<p>All these issues got me thinking about some sort of bookmark managing system that would let me organise my bookmarks across and between browsers and social bookmarking systems, within folders and live folders (i.e. tags) and so on - a windows explorer like view, if you like, within which is could  move, syhnch and organise bookmarks to my heart's desire.</p>

<p>So  - can I find the raw ingredients for such a tool?</p>

<p>Well, synching between browser bookmark formats looks to be supported by several tools and scripts that are floating around the web. <a href="http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man1/xbel_parse.1.html">xbel_parse</a> is part of a Linux command line tool collection that supports the conversion of Netscape, IE, Opera and links bookmarks to and from <a href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/">XBEL</a> (the XML Bookmark Exchange Language).</p>

<p>In order to achieve the same thing in a pre-built desktop client, <a href="http://bookmarkbridge.sourceforge.net/">BookmarkBridge</a> looks a good bet:</p>

<blockquote>a small, easy to use, multi-platform, GUI-based utility that allows the user to share bookmarks between all their browsers. The user runs it periodically to synchronize between the browsers.</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://bookmarkbridge.sourceforge.net/main_screen.png" alt="bookmarkbridge screenshot" /></p>

<p>Many of the social bookmarking systems now support import/export from/to the major browser bookmark formats (although I heard tales of problems importing into delicious) and so there is a clunky way there for synching bookmarks across systems for those systems that do not allow an import via API calls (simpy for example will happily import delicious bookmarks).</p>

<p>I was going to say that I haven't yet seen a client like BookMarkBridge, for example, that will automatically pull bookmarks down form a social bookmarking system and upload them to another (or import them into a browser) but then I stumbled across <a href="http://sitebar.org/">Sitebar</a> that looks like it may support this sort of functionality, or at least, it supports borwser/XBEL bookmark formats as well as RSS and OPML. The <a href="http://sitebar.org/downloads.php">Sitebar code and server are available as open source</a> so I think I really need to go and check it out... From the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=308706&group_id=76467">Sitebar version 3.3rc1. release notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Export Bookmarks" reworked and enhanced with feed possibility. SiteBar can now produce feeds in many formats and with many options. Following formats were added: Atom, RDF, RSS, OPML, XBEL. Command "Export Bookmarks" was added to "Maintain Trees" and allows export of all accessible trees. New command "Export Bookmarks Settings" allows to specify some details about feeds. "Import Bookmarks" reworked, import from following formats added Atom, RSS, OPML, RDF, XBEL. XBEL is now the default export/import format for SiteBar.</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm...<br />
 <br />
Anyway, one thing that occurred to me that I haven't done for a long time was to think about the various ways I could use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/livebookmarks.html">live bookmarks</a> to display my delicious bookmarks, for example, in my browser. This has limited utility though  - for example, I can't build up folder hierarchies (I don't think) using live bookmarks on the toolbar or in the bookmarks sidebar. </p>

<p><img alt="liveBookmarkNew.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/liveBookmarkNew.jpg" width="307" height="239" border="0" /> <img alt="liveBookmarkSiderbar.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/liveBookmarkSiderbar.jpg" width="385" height="295" border="0" /></p>

<p>However, feedreaders that support OPML do let you have folder directories, don't they?;-) Like <A href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a> for instance...</p>

<p>Which means that if I construct an appropriate OPML feed, I can import a list of 'folder organised' bookmarks from a social bookmarks feed...</p>

<p>Where to find such a feed, though...? Hmmm - I feel a tweak to the Social Bookmarks OPML Feed Generator coming on. Here's a first attempt - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPMLFeedBlender-d.html">Social Bookmarks OPML feed generator with directory structure</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="sbOPMLFolder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbOPMLFolder.jpg" width="604" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>(You'll notice the additional structure can be suppressed via the checkbox. The profiles are numbered as they are becuase I'd previously created, and deleted, a couple of feed profiles. It's easy enough to let a user name a feed profile, but I'd need to change the interface around a bit (I'm running out of room!) In the meantime, folders can be renamed in the bookmark manager.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I now save the OPML and import it into Sage, this is what I get:</p>

<p><img alt="sbOPMLSage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbOPMLSage.jpg" width="376" height="561" border="0" /></p>

<p>What I'm wondering now is, should I also support additional structure, for example organising user folders where there are several users in a profile, or social bookmarking system folders where several users are defined?</p>

<p>Any comments? If so, add a comment from the main page or calendar page copy of this post, or mail me...</p>

<p>PS just because, here are a couple of ways of getting bookmarks into multiple social bookmarking systems at the same time. Firstly, the <a href="http://www.onlywire.com/">OnlyWire</a> service and bookmarklet lets you set up a profile containing several social bookmarking system accounts and post to them all with a single bookmarklet. Secondly, there's this <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/code/marklet_maker.php">Multipost Bookmarklet Tool</a> which lets you select a set of social bookmarking systems and generate a bookmarklet that will post to them all. The source is available for this tool - maybe I should find a way of integrating it into my tool?</p>

<p>And finally - for anyone into social bookmarking interoperability, I recommend you sign up to the BIF - Bookmark Interchange Format - Mailing List. Details of where to find it, along with a bit of background, can be found <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-March/003552.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Ad Supported Courses</h3>

<p>Just a quick observation - perhaps a poor one - but are there big changes - <em>really big</em> changes, I mean - afoot in the world of home computing and the web? For example, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=172">Microsoft adCenter launched - Ballmer says Microsoft evolving from software to media company</a> could be something major, couldn't it?</p>

<p>And from earlier this week, <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/04/amazon-drops-google-from-a9-and-alexa.html">Amazon Drops Google From A9 And Alexa</a> - replaces it with <em>Windows Live Search</em>.</p>

<p>There have also been mutterings about <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2155283/rumours-microsoft-pondering">Microsoft doing a deal with Yahoo</a> (perhaps driven by the fact they lost out when Google beat them to a deal with AOL last year...?)</p>

<p>Skype seem to be evolving a unified messaging product (e.g. <a href="http://www.skype.com/help/guides/sms.html">Skype SMS is new out</a> as are <a href="http://www.skype.com/help/guides/skypecasts.html">large audio chat rooms</a> (way bigger than conference calls). They're eBay, aren't they, Skype? And eBay are talking to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12419257/">Microsoft and Yahoo</a>, I heard...</p>

<p>I also thought it quite amusing that <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2006/05/01/google_worried_about_microsofts_ie7.html">Google have been sulking this week</a> about who should get top billling as the default search engine in a newly installed browser.</p>

<p>Now my head hurts.... is there something happening? ... or perhaps these companies are playing these games all the time, and I've only just spotted them dancing... <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002532.php">Battelle says</a> (of Microsoft and Yahoo): <em>"This seems to be a non story. Everyone talks to everyone about everything, all the time. End of story."</em></p>

<p>Ok - I'll go back to ignoring them again (it must just have been a case of buses coming in threes for me to notice this time round).</p>

<p>Anyway - the point of the post was - the web seems to becoming an ad revenue driven space in many respects. What potential is there for ad and affiliate fee supported courses? E.g. if you're 'free' course has a text book, and you sell the text to the student via an Amazon affiliate link, you get a cut, right? What other potentially learning related affiliate programmes are there, I wonder? How about some of the big academic databases - do any of them have affiliate programmes? Or the British Library?!</p>

<p>You'd want any ads to be relevant - and perhaps add utility value as <em>content in their own terms</em> - too. Job listings would be an obvious source of advertising (doing a course, want a better job...)  and potentially a source of small fees arising from any successful job placements that result from a click-thru on the learning site.</p>

<p>Something else I heard to do driving back from the school run, on an IT conversation/Accelerating Change podcast about <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail731.html">The Future of Work</a> was the comment that eBay had created a platform on which other people could do business (and pay eBay for the privilege). An old story, yes, but is there a platform that would allow something like the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk">OCI</a> to become revenue generating by allowing other people to do business via it (recruitment and dating agencies, book fulfilment etc.).</p>

<p>Or what about ad-supported OU courses in place of a course fee, all other things being kept equal, <em>except</em>, perhaps, that you'd have to buy the course books yourself from via an approved link, or if you wanted a printed copy of the course material (otherwise provided as a PDF) you'd have to pay for it (or get it printed on demand from a listed service that passed the OU a commission). And if there was commercial software in the course, maybe you'd have to buy it yourself (at an OU negotiated educational discount, of course, but with the OU taking a small commission fee too).</p>

<p>To take a lead from Amazon (who want you to fulfil your purchase desires however they can, even if it means sending you off to a third party seller) there should also be links to a <a href="http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/">second hand course materials market</a>. (Just for completeness, you can purchase some OU materials on their own (i.e. 'outside' of a course) via <a href="http://www.ouw.co.uk/">OU Worldwide</a>.)</p>

<h3 class="title">Talis Silkworm Library 2.0 Platform</h3>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> documentation for the Talis Platform<br />
 (Library 2.0) API is now starting to appear on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a> at <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/platform/">Talis Platform API</a>.</p>

<p>A week or so ago, a public draft of the Talis Community Licence appeared in <a href="http://iandavis.com/blog/2006/04/announcing-the-talis-community-licence">this blog post</a>.  <br />
 It came with the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>[This licence] is going to play a key role in [the Talis Silkworm] technology platform. It gives users and contributors of all kinds of platform data some fundamental rights with one important restriction. Basically it:

<p>    * Grants the freedom to use the data for any purpose<br />
    * Grants the freedom to modify and mix the data<br />
    * Grants the freedom to redistribute copies<br />
    * Prevents any attempt to deny those freedoms to others</p>

<p>We're expecting the Talis platform to manage and make available under this licence a huge variety of data ranging from MARC to RDF and everything in-between - that's 4 decades of data formats!</p>

<p>The licence has its roots in the GPL and includes the same sort of redistribution...</blockquote></p>

<p>I mailed this announcement to a select few, with the comment that it seemed to signal the imminent arrival of an open APIs to the <a href="http://silkworm.talis.com/">Silkworm platform</a>, something that had been hinted at when <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/">Paul Miller</a>, the Talis <em>technology evangelist</em> spoke at the OU <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Well - you'll be glad to know the first phase of the Talis Library 2.0 platform duly arrived in the form of the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ ">Silkworm directory</a> last week (blogged about <a href="http://informationtakesover.co.uk/archives/2006/04/27/talis-platform-silkworm/">here</a>).</p>

<p>A few of us had had a sneak preview (much appreciated, thanks) beforehand, which is partly why I've held off blogging about it - I'm a little guilty that I haven't found the time to knock up some sort of OU/Silkworm mashup (I was hoping to find an hour (that may have turned into four - you know how it goes!) to put something together, but other things are afoot at the moment that have got in the way of anything that might turn into open ended play time...)</p>

<p>Anyway, the first <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/">Silkworm Direcroty interface</a> is now open to play with, and I'm assured API details are on the way.</p>

<p>As some details are out now, and more due any time,  I think it's probably ok to pass on some of the details that Ian Davies originally mailed out:</p>

<blockquote>Technically the directory runs off an RDF store using Jena and Joseki, fronted by a thin web app written in ASP.NET and XSLT. The directory stores descriptions of collections, physical locations and electronic services. [e.g. here's a description of the <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql?query=describe+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdirectory.talis.com%2Fres%2Fdddconv-rlg1418%23self%3E">Open University collection</a>] We'll be introducing grouping of resources, descriptions of organisations and relationships between collections soon. The services are described in detail as RDF so we can programatically build queries into them.
...
There are a number of other RDF-based services .... Each primary resource in the directory
links to its RDF representation via a little blue icon beside its title. These point to our <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql">sparql endpoint</a>

<p>For the sparql service we plan on not allowing GRAPH/FROM queries<br />
either, certainly not from day one. As we scale the service out we might<br />
enable it.</p>

<p>We're using Joseki for the Sparql stuff. All the pages you see at http://directory.talis.com/ui/ are generated using XSLT on RDF/XML coming out of Joseki.</blockquote></p>

<p>Collection information is alo published as HTML as this page describing the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ViewService.aspx?id=http://directory.talis.com/res/dddconv-rlg1418-svc%23self">OU Library OPAC</a> demonstrates (the enabled search over the catalogue even works, too:-)</p>

<p>Some of the URLs look as if they are going to be hackable, generatable(?), which is handy. For example, this URL: <em>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/bib?title=rdf</em> is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We have a public service that uses the service information to automatically link into the OPAC. For example, on that page above you can see the generated identifier for Bath University is "ad9.sw". You can plug that into a URL like this and search for RDF.

<p>The [URL] syntax is a custom one based on what we know we can support for the majority of our service descriptions. It currently supports isbn, title and author parameters. Full documentation is coming :) We plan to support "real" protocols like SRU and OAI and map them to the  capabilities of the target OPAC. These will have URLs like:</p>

<p>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/sru</blockquote></p>

<p>An RDF returning search is also supported, taking the form <em>http://api.talis.com/1/dir/collections?api_key=?????&search=open</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormRDF.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormRDF.jpg" width="663" height="420" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how the library location lookup service can be used to augment the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/update/access_acdem.html">OU 'Libraries Near You' service</a> which provides an ugly interface to a 'library by postcode' lookup service augmented with information about lending rights for OU students, as well as library opening times and other administrative information.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Silkworm version goes for a Google maps mashup:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormMap.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormMap.jpg" width="699" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment though, the OU data is far more reliable (and maintained). The Talis approach appears to be <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/GetInvolved.aspx">appealing to community support/maintenance of the library information database</a>, something the OU has done centrally (by phoning people up and hassling them, I guess!)</p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how we can work with Talis on maintaining this sort of information, and guaranteeing its correctness, for mutual benefit. (I should qualify that - I am 'outside the system' and so restricted to buolding proof of concept demonstrators that othe people would have to decide to adopt...)</p>

<p>If you want to keep up with what Talis are doing, I believe more announcements are due throughout May on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">WebApping - Web Apps Made Blog Easy</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> were reporting a new start up <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/30/wyaworks-app-builder-for-non-coders/">a couple of days ago</a> that <em>"aims to do for web development what blogging has done for publishing"</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wyaworks.blogspot.com/">WyaWorks</a>' first (?) product - <a href="http://wyaworks.blogspot.com/">WyaCracker</a> - allows you to generate templated, form based applications without having to do any coding. This apparently is just a taster of more exciting things to come, so whilst the current Wyacracker offering is not that exciting in and of itself, it'll be interesting to see what they announce next.</p>

<p>There have been several attempts over the last few months to make web app publishing as easy as blog posting, of course. <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> allows you to clone and customise a wide variety of  PHP coded "Web 2.0 mashup" apps running on Ning's servers, and <a href="http://www.zohocreator.com/">ZohoCreator</a> does something similar for business/office apps.</p>

<p>Another approach, that I haven't seen published anywhere, came out of a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006075.html">comment discussion on this blog</a>. To quote from there:</p>

<blockquote>More and more services are offering easy to use file storage, but as yet there aren't many that have an 'install here' button as well as an 'upload here' button. One issue, I guess, is traffic, server load, an unwillingness to run apps that may get stuck in a loop and trash the server, security etc. ...

<p>...perhaps having hosting sites with B2B APIs that require a signature from a known provider who is allowed to install software onto a hosted account via an API. So the user buys the software off [a commercial provider, provides] their host details and account name, [and this information is then used to go] through the host's API and install the software into the user's account.</blockquote></p>

<p>This approach might also be used to publish apps from sites such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> (perhaps proven stable releases could be given keys that would identify as them stable enough for a one click publishing option?)</p>

<p>This idea - brought to mind by the <a href="http://www.teamslide.com/">Teamslide</a> model (which is an <em>old</em> model of course - sell the software and let the user install it - rather than the web 2.0 approach - sign up to an online app and use the provider's servers to host your account) in which they aim to:</p>

<blockquote>empower the user and encourage him/her to use his webserver/webspace (who is bored stiff) for more than hosting webpages: Install Online Software, benefit from anywhere, anytime computing but keep control and don't turn all your personal data to Google or WebEx by subscribing to an Online Service.</blockquote>

<p>My only problem with that approach is that many users either don't have access to a server, or wouldn't know how to (or have the privilieges required to) install software on it if they did.</p>

<p>What I'd like to see is a hosting service where you can publish your apps with a single click. Many apps come with config scripts, and so this approach could perhaps be used to develop a web app publishing platform... Just as I can post to my blog with a single click, I'd like to go to Sourceforge and 'publish' an app with a single click...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Code Search on BBC Programme Catalogue</h3>

<p>Last week, the BBC released  a beta (err, <em>experimental</em>!;-) version of its <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax">Programme Catalogue Search Tool</a>.</p>

<p>The search results don't link to downloads (yet?) but even so, the catalogue is still a fascinating resource. (There are other media archives, of course (e.g. I have bookmarked a few<a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/archive">here</a>), but some of them are subscription only (e.g. the <a href="http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/">British Universities Film and Video Council</a>), unlike the BBC offering, which is free).)</p>

<p>As well as providing a normal (human readable) web page of search results, machine readable XML (RDF, actually) results are also available, which makes for easy reuse of results.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried out one or two searches for the OU (using search terms 'Open University', OU, etc.). As well as the simple/basic search, I found the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/advanced_search">advanced search page</a> to be very useful.</p>

<p><img alt="BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" width="693" height="305" border="0" /></p>

<p>The most successful search turned up <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/OU">BBC catalogue search (series): OU</a>, which recorded several thousand entries over the last thirty years.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that a search can be made quite effectively for OU course programmes by course code. For example, here's a search for <em>S322</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322</a></p>

<p>That is, just use a query of the form:</p>

<p><em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:<strong>courseCode</strong></em></p>

<p>I haven't had time to check the OU library to see whether this information is available from any of their catalogues, but I suspect that it isn't(!). No matter  - the RDF feed from each catalogue entry page means that the information is available in a form that can be pulled easily enough into any other page if you know the catalogue entry number for a particular programme.</p>

<p>For example, here's a (human readable) catalogue entry page for a T209 programme:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>And here's the machine readable (XML/RDF)  result:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>The translation between the two is simple:</p>

<p>Web page: <em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>infax</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em><br />
RDF page:<em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>xml</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em></p>

<p>However, I haven't (yet) stumbled on a way of making a query to the catalogue that returns an XML response, which makes finding the results so they can be pulled into a page a little harder...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a plea to the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC Backstage</a> mailing list (backstage@lists.bbc.co.uk) turned up the answer:</p>

<blockquote>If you want to convert your web-based searches into REST-like requests, you want to pick out the "/infax/" in the url and change it to "/xml/" and "/feed/".</blockquote>

<p>So for example,  the atom/feed search:<br />
<a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who</a> works fine, as does <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209</a></p>

<p>(Just in passing, most of the results I looked at had a catalogue ID that included <em>OU</em> as the second and third characters. Does anyone happen to know what coding scheme was used to generate catalogue numbers?)</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful search</a> tool, I think when I allowed users to search for books/courses by keyword, the search was applied to book titles as well as course titles. I wonder how easy it would be to use the BBC catalogue info in the same way - for example, allowing users to make a general keyword search and then filtering on results that OU programming to identify courses by coursecode that are somehow keyed by a given keyword? </p>

<p>(Even in the BBC Catalogue Advanced Search, I couldn't find a way of combining arguments, e.g. to allow me to search on <em>title AND series</em>. Does anyone know if this is possible and if so, what the syntax is?) <em>Apparently, Boolean search is not supported at the moment..</em><br />
</p>
