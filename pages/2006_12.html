<p>Doodling with the Library Traveller script, I found that Blackwells use an ISBN 13 code in their book details page URLs, which the Amazon web service I use to look up book info (title, author etc.) doesn't much like: it wants ISBN 10.</p>

<p>Here's a first attempt at a javascript function to convert from ISBN13 to 10. Note I can't guarantee it's correct (though it seemed to work with a couple of test ISBNs I just tried).</p>

<pre>function isbn13to10(isbn13)
 {
   var isbn9 = isbn13.substring(3,12);
   var n=0; var c=0;
   for (i=1;i<10;i++) {
     c = isbn9.substr(i,1) * 1;
     if ((c>0)&&(c<9)) n += (11-i)*c;
   }
   n = 11 - n%11;
   if (n==11) isbn10=isbn9+'0';
   else if (n==10) isbn10=isbn9+'X';
   else isbn10=isbn9+n;
   //alert(isbn10);
   return isbn10;
 }</pre>
 
If you spot any flaws (quite likely, I was trying to translate a couple of functions from other languages and it's toooooo late... :-( please post a comment with a fix ;-)

<p>When I discovered that the OU regional offices had their own IP ranges, I thought it might be OUseful to knock up a small web service that would return the corresponding region number. This service can then be used to help customise the return of content that is tuned to a particular region.</p>

<p>I haven't thought of any useful applications of this yet, except this crude <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/thisRegion.php">demo page</a> that will forward the user to the corresponding regional office page (such as <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/details.aspx?contactid=4">this one for Region 04</a>) if they try to view it from an OU regional office.</p>

<p>Anyway - for what it's worth, here's the link: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php">IP address to OU regional office identifier service</a>.</p>

<p>The information is returned in the form:</p>

<p>&lt;pingBack&gt;<br />
 &lt;ipAddress&gt; 123.25.67.89 &lt;/ipAddress&gt;<br />
 &lt;ouLocation&gt; RegionNN  &lt;/ouLocation&gt;<br />
&lt;/pingBack&gt;</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php?demo=demo">a demo</a>.</p>

<p>If you're in an OU regional office, a visit to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/whatRegion.php">this page</a> should tell you which:-)</p>

<p>If you know of - or can think of - services that would benefit or support regional office localisation, let me know...</p>

<p>If you want to use the service, mail me, and I'll give you a stable URL for the service.</p>

<!--
<p>One of the 'emergent' features I've discovered about <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a> is the ability to do roundtripping - sort of.... By this I mean it's possible to use a tool in the stringle context to create a resource that you can bookmark and immediately gain access to from the StringLE navigation panel.</p>

<p>For example: if I add a feed to one of my delicious bookmark tags to the OPML file that is used to provide navigation via the StringLE embedded Grazr widget, I can create a resource and bookmark it with that tag (often from the resource creation application directly), at which point it becomes  available via the navigation widget (err, that's not strictly true - the feed may need updating in the widget).</p>

<p>As well as being personally useful, this approach can be quite powerful in a social or collaborative context, where users can create - and share links to - new resources in real time, and in one place.</p>

<p>Using bookmarks in this way - as some sort of cross between a database and a live, cross-resource navigation menu - is actually quite appealing to me, particularly when resource creation tools are tightly coupled to the bookmarking system via a 'bookmark this creation' link. </p>

<p>So I'm now on the lookout for apps that let you create resources and bookmark them directly into delicious ;-)</p>

<p>I'm also trying to think up a novel way of using <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit">Exhibit</a>, "a lightweight structured data publishing framework that lets you create web pages with support for sorting, filtering, and rich visualization".</p>

<p>For example, if you have a data source - such as bibliographic information in Bibtex format - you can use the Exhibition toolkit to produce <a href="http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/publications.html">your own interface to the Bibtex data</a>.</p>

<p>What happens is that "Exhibit essentially removes the need for a database or a server side web application" by taking the source document, treating it's contents as data, and putting a search and filter interface over the top of it.</p>

<p>Now I wonder, can I give it a <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> like back-end and use it to produce a single interface to user selected data sources?</p>

<p>Speaking of data, there's a data mashup tool just appeared on the scene too: <a href="http://www.swivel.com/">Swivel</a> ("YouTube for data" - described prelaunch in TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/05/swivel-to-launch-this-week-communitize-your-data/">here</a>.).</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that users upload their data, then anyone can remix it/plot it against other data sets (as long as the data shares at least one common dimension, such as time, I guess).</p>

<p>However, at the moment at least, it seems you can't directly plot data sets against each other withing the site limits. Unless I'm missing something obvious, it seems you can only create a graph that also includes data you have uploaded (one way of getting data into the system, I guess). The obvious workaround is to download someone else's data set (which you can do) and upload it back, I guess, then use it as the basis of your own graph.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.makeyougohmm.com/20061206/4020/">example of how to create a Swivel chart</a> (I dont have time to build one myself just now:-(</p>

<p>With online spreadsheets making APIs available (like <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/spreadsheets.html">Google Spreadsheets</a> and <a href=""://writer.zoho.com/public/help/zohoapi/fullpage">Zoho sheets</a>), it'll be interesting to see how long it takes for some online spreadsheets'n'Swivel mashups to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>What would be really neat would be to see <a href="http://www.liveclipboard.org/">Live Clipboard</a> functionality appearing on some of these sites, so users could easily cut and paste data between them...</p>

<p>I'd also quite like to see support for geo-data on Swivel, and integration with generic mapping APIs like <a href="http://www.mapstraction.com/">mapstraction</a>. Then maybe some animation tools like <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">Gapminder</a>;-)</p>

<p>Now I wonder, will <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> get into this area too? It'd be a powerful addition to a prototypical NingLE (which I am really going to have to start thinking about. properly..)?</p>

<!--
<p>Three days away blogging doing other things (helping scope a robotics show for <a href="http://www.techniquest.org/">Techniquest</a> in Cardiff for one thing) and it so feels like a chore coming back to it... so here's just a quick diary post to log recent OU Traveller progress before functionality gets locked down and styling spruced up ready for an official release by the Library :-)</p>

<p>Ok - so what's new? Looking back over the blog, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008658.html">last update</a> described a title and author lookup. Following discussions with the Library, the functionality has been tightened up somewhat and a greater focus placed on delivering OU Library services, with the result that things like a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006280.html">Google Books lookup</a> are unlikely to appear in the official release.</p>

<p>(Just by the by, <a href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=&scope=books">Microsoft Live Booksearch</a> also fired up today... )</p>

<p>Wherever possible, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006569.html">libezproxifying</a> of links to ebook resources has also been built in, which means single click-thru from the OU Traveller panel to books on O'Reilly Safari for example, as well as other e-holdings.</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerGreedy.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerGreedy.jpg" width="663" height="153" border="0" /></p>

<p>To produce the above screenshot, a two step lookup of the library catalogue is actually being carried out. For the particular book in question, an ISBN lookup on the catalogue returns a results page with two options - a link to the full results page for a physical copy of the book, and a link to the results page for an ebook holding. Being greedy, the script identifies the ebook link and a second background call to the library catalogue is made using this link. The ebook item results page that is consequently returned is then scoured for the link to the actual ebook resource, and it is this link that is the one that is presented in the Traveller panel.</p>

<p>The link text also disguises where the book is actually held. The same link text (<em>Available online (courtesy of The Open University Library)</em>) is also used for books held by O'Reilly Safari for example (which the OU Library also has a subscription to). What is interesting is that Safari ebook hits are not returned by the Voyager catalogue (maybe I should write a script to extend the library catalogue pages to report holdings users do have access to even if Voyager doesn't know about them? ;-)</p>

<p>I realised today that it's also possible to use an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php?output=json">IP address</a> lookup to identify whether a user is browsing from the OU network. In fact, it's actually possible to tell from the IP address whether or not the request has been made from within the <a href="http://www.shca.com/portfolio/default.asp?sctId=361&projType=Architecture">OU Library building</a> itself. Although I've not added the functionality yet, it would seem sensible to report back the actual shelf location of items held in the library via the Traveller panel for users who happen to be visiting Amazon from within the library. Or maybe not?</p>

<p>You may notice in the screenshot the link suggesting the user can propose the OU Library purchases the title in question. This links through to a 'book suggest' form which is <em>also</em> extended via the OU Traveller extension (here's an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007194.html">earlier example</a> of the same approach). In particular, book author and title information, as well as publication date, are automatically pasted into the page. The <em>No luck?</em> link appears whether or not the book is held (in any form) by the Library, partly because it makes the coding easier, partly to promote this service. At the moment, the suggestion form is geared towards the acquisition of physical books, but it would also be handy to be able to request the purchase of electronic resources too.</p>

<p>Through developing the script, I'm starting to realise how the OU Library will be increasingly able to support OU students in a traditional way. Unlike most universities, the OU campus is largely 'student-free' - not surprising, given we are a distance education institution. What this has meant to date is that book lending services focus on book provision to academics and central staff, as well as <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/loans/regstaff.html">loans to OU staff in the regions</a>.</p>

<p>Increasingly, however, the OU Library is able to fulfill information requests using eResources, so it may be that soon we will be able to offer  students a comprehensive OU Library ebook catalogue (I almost said OPAC  - but they're all <em>horrible</em> to use, aren't they? ;-) that they can use to borrow books from instantaneously.</p>

<p>Another thing I'd like to see arising from the current library website redesign project is the provision of local (physical) library catalogue search services to our students.</p>

<p>OU students often have lending rights at their <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/search/clickable_map.php">local academic library</a> but we don't provide a single uniform location in the OU library site from which to search these catalogues (how about  <em>library.open.ac.uk/local</em> for example, customised via a cookie or library login ID, and offering the same search box to everyone that leads to the students local library catalogue?).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/platform/">Talis Platform</a> project is one tool we could start using, but as with using all 'free' third party services/APIs: how do we know that a) the data will be kept up to date?; and b) how do we know the service will hang around for the next few years?</p>

<p>Taking a baby steps approach, what I'd quite like to see is a script that will add links identified via Talis Platform to results pages like <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/search/report.php?Region=04">this one</a> that in turm lead directly to the corresponding catalogue; or, even better, buttons that will let the user search the corresponding catalogue from a single search box at the top of the page...</p>

<p>I don't have time to pursue this at the moment, but if someone else did, I could start to use it to demo Talis Platform functionality to the library website redesign team..............</p>
