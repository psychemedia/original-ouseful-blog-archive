<h3 class="title">Gabbly Chatting To Myself About The OUseful Blog...</h3>

<p>Snippets of a <a href="http://gabbly.com">gabbly</a> chat with myself (how sad is that...?!) about the medium at <a href="http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog</a>...</p>

<p><img alt="gabblyOUseful.JPG" src="./gabblyOUseful.JPG" width="729" height="276" border="0" /></p>

<blockquote>gabber546: I don't think they can be edited or moderated, which is a possibly an issue.

<p>The comments do seem to persiost over several days. I'm not sure how the RSS feed works thugh? A daily digest in each item perhaps, rather than one item per chat comment?</p>

<p>I wonder if group chats would be possible, whereby I have a gabbly account with closed groups I am a member of that i could post to? That would get around the spam problem .</p>

<p>Hmm - there seems to be a word/character limit on how much you can post at once</p>

<p>gabber728: re groups - you could make a user sign in, and then choose which group they wanted to post to on each page</p>

<p>If you were logged in then you probably wouldn't need to change your name in the client</p>

<p>If I go to anew website, do we start a new conversation?</p>

<p>Tony: hmm- i went off to gabbly chat at ouseful.open.ac.uk, and nothing was recorded here.</p>

<p>It would perhaps be nice if when i left I could set the client to add 'Tony has just gone of to chat about ouseful.open.ac.uk'</p>

<p>ALso, i came back here from the ouseful.open.ac.uk chat. Again, it would be nice if i could set the client up to say 'Tony has just arrived from a chat at ouseful.open.ac.uk'</p>

<p>If gorups were supported, you could also have an option to display if any other groups members are gabbling at the mo, and if so, where...</p>

<p>You'd probably need to be allowed to set your own presence settings though, and have secret chats or hide the fact your are chatting, or waht page you are on</p>

<p>What happens if I 'change'...?</p>

<p>I see...</p>

<p>hmmmm - how do i leave? it would be nice to be able to 'say bye' and reload the page from http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog to http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog with a single gabbly client click</p>

<p>ooh - links are linkified</p>

<p>in fact, they become gabbly linkified</p>

<p>so where will gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog go if the linkifier prepended gabbly.com?</p>

<p>Welcome to Gabbly!</p>

<p>Tony2 has joined.</p>

<p>Tony2: I have in fact joined as myself (must be a cookie?) in a new tab opened buy clicking thedouble gabbly link...(it worked out not to chat on the chat page)</p>

<p>Tony2 is now Tony</p>

<p>Tony: I wonder who i am now - tony in one client and tony2 in another...what's my cookie set as?;-)</blockquote></p>
