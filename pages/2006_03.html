<p>Snippets of a <a href="http://gabbly.com">gabbly</a> chat with myself (how sad is that...?!) about the medium at <a href="http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog</a>...</p>

<p><img alt="gabblyOUseful.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gabblyOUseful.JPG" width="729" height="276" border="0" /></p>

<blockquote>gabber546: I don't think they can be edited or moderated, which is a possibly an issue.

<p>The comments do seem to persiost over several days. I'm not sure how the RSS feed works thugh? A daily digest in each item perhaps, rather than one item per chat comment?</p>

<p>I wonder if group chats would be possible, whereby I have a gabbly account with closed groups I am a member of that i could post to? That would get around the spam problem .</p>

<p>Hmm - there seems to be a word/character limit on how much you can post at once</p>

<p>gabber728: re groups - you could make a user sign in, and then choose which group they wanted to post to on each page</p>

<p>If you were logged in then you probably wouldn't need to change your name in the client</p>

<p>If I go to anew website, do we start a new conversation?</p>

<p>Tony: hmm- i went off to gabbly chat at ouseful.open.ac.uk, and nothing was recorded here.</p>

<p>It would perhaps be nice if when i left I could set the client to add 'Tony has just gone of to chat about ouseful.open.ac.uk'</p>

<p>ALso, i came back here from the ouseful.open.ac.uk chat. Again, it would be nice if i could set the client up to say 'Tony has just arrived from a chat at ouseful.open.ac.uk'</p>

<p>If gorups were supported, you could also have an option to display if any other groups members are gabbling at the mo, and if so, where...</p>

<p>You'd probably need to be allowed to set your own presence settings though, and have secret chats or hide the fact your are chatting, or waht page you are on</p>

<p>What happens if I 'change'...?</p>

<p>I see...</p>

<p>hmmmm - how do i leave? it would be nice to be able to 'say bye' and reload the page from http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog to http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog with a single gabbly client click</p>

<p>ooh - links are linkified</p>

<p>in fact, they become gabbly linkified</p>

<p>so where will gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog go if the linkifier prepended gabbly.com?</p>

<p>Welcome to Gabbly!</p>

<p>Tony2 has joined.</p>

<p>Tony2: I have in fact joined as myself (must be a cookie?) in a new tab opened buy clicking thedouble gabbly link...(it worked out not to chat on the chat page)</p>

<p>Tony2 is now Tony</p>

<p>Tony: I wonder who i am now - tony in one client and tony2 in another...what's my cookie set as?;-)</blockquote></p>

<h3 class="title">Commercial Advantages in DOI Resolution?</h3>

Walking the dog just now, I was pondering the extent to which linking to a resource via a digital object identifier (DOI) could be regarded as a persistent search. A normal link - &lt;a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog"&gt;OUseful blog&lt;/a&gt; - isn't really a...
<!--
<p>Walking the dog just now, I was pondering the extent to which linking to a resource via a digital object identifier (<a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>) could be regarded as a persistent search.</p>

<p>A normal link - <i>&lt;a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog"&gt;OUseful blog&lt;/a&gt;</i> - isn't really a search of course (unless you consider domain name resolution or URL rewriting some sort of search) so why should something like <a href="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond">doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond</a> be regarded as search? (The lookup is achieved using the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005952.html">OU LinkfinderPlus resolver</a>.)</p>

<p>Well, the DOI resolver - which maps a DOI onto an electronic resource - makes the link between a persistent DOI and a potentially transitory location for the resource. Now I'm not clear about the actual mapping between a DOI and a resource, but from the way I've seen them (ab)used(?), DOIs seem to act a bit like an ISBN in the sense that  a particular journal article, say, may have different DOIs according to which database it is on (cf. different ISBNs for hard and soft cover books); and the same DOI may also point to different archived copies of a particular document (for example, different shelf copies of a book with the same ISBN).</p>

<p>That is, my understanding is that a DOI can have a one-to-many relationship with the different locations a particular article might be retrieved from; and there may also be a many-one-relationship between several DOIs and a particular article.</p>

<p>(If anyone can clarify this for me before I read the specs, comments will be open for a day or two from the <a href='http://http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog'>OUseful Blog homepage</a> page;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, what struck me was that if this is indeed the case then the resolver is potentially searching several sources when provided a DOI, with the intention of sending the user to one of them, or returning one of the resource instantiations back to the user.</p>

<p>So for the case of one DOI pointing to many potential retrieval locations, how does the resolver decide which to return?</p>

<p>Isn't there potentially a commercial advantage here for the service location that is preferentially returned?</p>

<p>I need to go and read the specs I think...</p>

<!--
<p>Just a quick follow up to the previous post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005989.html">online application bundles</a> - <a href="ajaxlaunch.com/">Ajaxlaunch</a> have announced that over the coming weeks they are going to release a series of what are essentially browser based rich interface applications with the look and feel of current desktop apps, but provided as a lightweight browser based apps.</p>

<p>The opening shot is a cutdown Microsoft Word lookalike: <a href="http://www.ajaxwrite.com">ajaxWrite</a>. What's different about it is that files are saved to and from the desktop, with the client residing in the browser.</p>

<p>At the moment it's limited to Firefox, but the intention appears to be to go for cross-platform/cross-browser apps.</p>

<p>There's also a stated intention to keep the base offering free.</p>

<p>So - as far as providing free office apps for our students goes, there appear to be 5 (and counting) models:</p>

<p>1) Provide a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM with an installer for a bundle of desktop apps;<br />
2) Provide a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM/USB memory stick with an installer for a bundle of portable apps (or preinstalled in the case of the USB memory stick);<br />
3) Provide a Google Pack like downloadable bundle;<br />
4) Provide links to (and ideally web service integration with) online apps likely Writely.<br />
5) Provide links to browser based apps that can write to and from the desktop, like ajaxWrite.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: surely this must complete the set? Your own office suite on a KDE (Linux) desktop, accessed remotely from <a href="http://www.cosmopod.com/">CosmoPOD</a>.</p>

<p>What's the betting we just stick to (1) the online apps CD?!</p>

<h3 class="title">Making the Most of Online Apps</h3>

<p>I've written before about the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/p3.shtml">application bundle</a> the OU gives out on CD to our students and how we might <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">consider alternative approaches</a> to this in the form of delivering portable apps on a USB memory stick, or downloadable bundles like the Google Pack.</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript"><!--<br />
google_ad_client = "pub-4627481582813740";<br />
google_ad_width = 110;<br />
google_ad_height = 32;<br />
google_ad_format = "110x32_as_rimg";<br />

//--></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br />
</script></p>

<p>There is a third way, of course, that is increasingly possible and that is to provide an online application wrapper that allows students to easily set up an online office environment for themselves.</p>

<p>For example, with <a href="http://www2.writely.com/info/WritelyOverflowFAQ.htm#Google">Google's purchase of Writely</a> presumably putting <a href="http://writely.com/">Writely</a> on a secure footing, we could now  point students to that as a possible application for them to use for writing documents.</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone is scouting the <a href="http://numsum.com/">Numsum</a> online spreadsheet, but that's another online application we could possibly be referring students to.</p>

<p>Ideally of course we'd be able to offer one click registration to these services (or the ones they select) for students who aren't already registered with them.</p>

<p>A section of the student's personal profile page on the OU system could also be used to allow them to enter their web apps login details so they could access these third party services from within the OU (or <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">OCI</a> learning environment. </p>

<p>Ideally we'd be able to offer common authenitication to allow students who have an current OU authentication ticket to access Writely, or Numsum etc. although I suspect the OU powers that be would be wary of exploring any such relationship with a web startup, or a web monster!</p>

<p>Web services would provide an alternative integration route, of course, even if it's only at the level of syndicating feeds (e.g. the <a href="http://www.writely.com/BasePage.aspx?action=rssInfo">Writely personal RSS feed</a> can be accessed via a <a href="http://writely.blogspot.com/2005/10/calling-all-rss-readers.html">secure <em>https</em> route</a>.)</p>

<p>That's still pretty neat, though. For example, I just added Writely to my <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> profile (read how <a href="http://blog.netvibes.com/?2005/10/20/10-web-20-integration-the-writely-module">here</a>), and was immediatley able to click through from Netvibes to any of my public Writely documents (and then edit them with another single click). The feed keeps users updated as to changes that may have been made by other authors collaborating on a document, which could be very handy in an OU context, with several students working at a distance on a common document as a part of a group exercise, for example. One for MyOpenLibrary, perhaps?</p>

<p>Netvibes has several other neat feed consuming ideas - for example GMail, and iCal calendar feeds. (Hmmm - calandars... perhaps we could add an online calendar to the mix, like <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> perhaps? I know calendaring is one of the VLE mini-projects - I really hope they make whatever solution they go for syndication friendly (both in and out)!)</p>

<p>And finally - you may have noticed that this is (sort of) an apps corollary to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html"><em>ad hoc</em> community doodle</a> I posted with last week. That's purely intentional...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Catalogue Takes Lead from Amazon?</h3>

<!--
<p>Whilst I was chatting to someone the other day about the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/courses">OU courses</a> page, where potential students can search through our course offerings, they mentioned that some of the pages now have links to taster material.</p>

<p>We've done this ourselves in Faculty hosted pages before (for example, here are some links to tasters for courses in the <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/courses.htm">Relevant Knowledge Programme</a> (I look after T184 :-)), but this was the first I'd heard of  it being done on a more formal basis.</p>

<p>Here's how the link appears on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/l310">courses page for L310</a>, a final year undergraduate equivalent French language course:</p>

<p><img alt="courseTasterLink.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseTasterLink.JPG" width="541" height="355" border="0" /></p>

<p><strong>Look Inside the Course</strong></p>

<p>Following the link takes you to a more detailed page that allows you to essentially leaf through the course - there's an a image of the course text, links to the course description and course guide, and of course links to sample course teaching materials as well as assessment materials. </p>

<p><img alt="courseTaster.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseTaster.JPG" width="657" height="350" border="0" /></p>

<p>So here then we essentially have a formalised way of presenting a 'look inside the course', which I think is an excellent idea. </p>

<p>Going back to the main courses page, there are a few other interesting things about it that have appeared over the last few months.</p>

<p><strong>Required Books</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, a list of the set books the student is required to purchase for the course:</p>

<p><img alt="setBookToBuy.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/setBookToBuy.JPG" width="576" height="196" border="0" /></p>

<p>Now I'm not sure where the information to generate this section of the page comes from, but it's exactly the sort of end point I had in mind for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful booksearch</a> web service (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/search.php?searchTerm=l310&submitSearch=Search&searchType=coursecode">L310 on OUseful Books</a>, or as <a hre="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/courseSearchRSS.php?CFSearch=l310">RSS</a>), so it would be interesting to see if that's the approach they went down (I suspect it isn't).</p>

<p>There are affiliate fees to be had here!</p>

<p><strong>Course Reviews</strong></p>

<p>A bit further down the page are a couple of course reviews.</p>

<p><img alt="OUCourseReviews.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUCourseReviews.JPG" width="585" height="223" border="0" /></p>

<p>These are pulled in from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/">course reviews site</a>, where currently registered students can also submit reviews. (I'm not sure if this is locked down so that only students who have been registered as starting a course are allowed to post a review?).</p>

<p>One thing that appears to be lacking from the reviews are numerical/star ratings - I'd be interested to hear what factors were taken into account when that decision was made.</p>

<p><strong>Students Who Studied This Course Also Studied...</strong></p>

<p>This is an interesting section, and I'm not sure how it's created.</p>

<p><img alt="OUCourseAlsoStudied.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUCourseAlsoStudied.JPG" width="565" height="224" border="0" /></p>

<p>Elsewhere on the page are listings of the programmes/qualifications the course belongs to (so for example a student on a particular degree programme will have to take at least the set of courses that are required for that degree) and of course you'd expect a large overlap between the 'courses also studied' and the courses listed in a particular degree programme.</p>

<p>That's now of course.</p>

<p>It's rather a shame that 'people who studied this also studied that' technology is only now becoming useable in a scalebale way, becuase more and more the OU is moving to named degree programmes with specified course profiles.</p>

<p>Historically, the OU was a little bit more <em>laissez faire</em> and really pushed the 'Combined Studies' idea, in which students could - with guidance - create their own degree profiles (i.e. eassentially choose their own degree make-up).</p>

<p>If that was still the model in any significant sense, then making 'students who studied this also studied that' information would be one way of identifying student created emergent degree profiles (or degree pathways) that reflected student's course needs as perceived by them in volume.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>

<p>The new course pages have a lot in common with emerging models of e-tailing: 'look inside' features (i.e. browse the product), reviews, crowd preferences and so on. There isn't a chatlink or phonelink for a student to be able to chat to a course adviser  yet, but maybe that's coming?</p>

<p>We do already sell <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/vouchers/">gift vouchers</a> for some courses, but these aren't electronic yet (I don't think you can redeem them as part of an online registration process, which is a shame). I don;t think the vouchers are available commercially yet, either, though I'd love to see one on Amazon!</p>

<p>And finally, as a URL hacker (that is, someone who uses URLs to navigate) there are a couple of things worth commenting on about this site. the course taster material for L310 appears at <em>http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/tasters/l310/</em> which is all very sensible.</p>

<p>So sensible you might expect the course decription to live at <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/l310/">http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/l310/</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="OUsorry.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUsorry.JPG" width="663" height="252" border="0" /></p>

<p>Oops... the actual address is the far from friendly <em>http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01l310</em> which really should be tidied up. (I always use a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/l310">OUseful redirect: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/l310</em></a>).</p>

<p>This is interesting  - just as AJAX essentially reinvented a technology that had been around for ages and breathed new life into it, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a> has <a href=""http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008901.html>rediscovered</a> another old Microsoft technology - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/hta/overview/htaoverview.asp">HTML Applications (HTAs)</a> (Russell's find is also reported with a brief commentary at <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ms-html-applications">Ajaxian</a>.)</p>

<p>The technique can take a single page browser app and turn it into a 'proper' Windows like app, presumably along with the ability to manipulate files (as long as you're on a Windows box that is)...</p>

<p>If only I had time to explore this a little...if I can use HTAs to save arbitrary text strings to a file, it'd be a handy way of saving web page app generated OPML file like the one created by my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPML.html">social bookmarking OPML feed generator</a></p>

<p>Interesting how Javascript, once much maligned for not being a 'proper' programming language is continuing to find its way out of the browser and onto the desktop (which reminds me, I've not had a look at what's going on in <s>Konfabulator</s> <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! widgets</a> land for a bit...</p>

<p>And interesting how a lot of stuff coming out of Web 2.0 has been around for years (DHTML, anybody?).</p>

<p>So is Web 2.0 a remake of Web 1.0, or a sequel?</p>

<!--
<p>A phrase I've heard a couple of times in recent weeks about media strategies for coping with multiple digital channels is the idea of "appointments with personalities" in which media consumers (television viewers, magazine readers etc.) select what channel to watch, or magazine to read etc. on the basis of the 'personaility brand' fronting the programme or ostensibly writing a column.</p>

<p>For media organisations with a blend (mix?) of output channels in their media portfolio (?) (for example, across several television channels, or across television and radio, or television and print) you can see how this might be attractive.</p>

<p>I saw the idea of cross-selling channels through personalities in action tonight, with a voiced over trail for a radio programme (Sherlock Holmes' Casebook) over the end of last week's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/hustle/">Hustle</a> (BBC1) that happened to feature <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/hustle/ash_morgan.shtml">Robert Glenister</a>  (sold as 'Ash' from Hustle).</p>

<p>The programme had been broadcast on one of the BBC digital radio channels (Radio 7) earlier in the day on Friday - the day on which Hustle was broadcast - and the trail mentioned it was available as a 'Listen Again' programme via the BBC website (though it's not cross-linked to from the Hustle webpage, which is perhaps an oversight of content management and automatic link generation from a 'this actor also appears in' persistent search across the BBC domain.)</p>

<p>One other thing to mention - I was watching a 'time shifted' (i.e. recorded) version of Hustle, saved via a 'record this programme every week' timed recording on our DVD/hard drive.</p>

<p>With the BBC's current policy of making 'listen again' programmes available for a week after transmission, my ability to listen again works in this case for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the two programmes were transmitted on the same day; secondly, the pattern we appear to have fallen into of watching programmes weekly (i.e. watching one episode of a series <em>before</em> the next is braodcast, <em>just in case</em> we get a chance to see the next episode when it is broadcast (which almost never happens).</p>

<p>So even though we vary rarely watch programmes as they are broadcast, our family viewing behaviour is still regulated by the 'broadcast once' (for television) schedule, to the extent that we try to watch recorded programmes before the next episode in a series is broadcast, even if we have no intention of watching the programme at the time it is broadcast.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a time management thing, or perhaps it's a finite hard drive capacity thing (for the majority of series we only have one episode of a series on the hard drive at a time - it is watched and erased before the next episode is broadcast and recorded, almost as if there were a single episode slot on the hard drive for a particular series (the exception being Dr Who, where we save all the episodes in a series and then dump them to DVD;-)</p>

<p>Last week I tried to demo some DOI (digital object identifier) links as a possible way of avoiding link rot in course materials over time, but had the demo fail becasue the link resolver at ny intended target (IEEE Xplore) appeared to be down.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to try some things out building on the various URL combinations that effectively pipe one web site via another described <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005952.html">here</a> and what fdo I get?</p>

<p><img alt="doiNot.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/doiNot.JPG" width="668" height="337" border="0" /></p>

<p>Harrumph - and you know what the really irritating thing is, I don;t have the full references to the things I wanted to try to link to, only their DOIs...</p>

<p>If DOIs are going to work, the resolver needs to be up 5 9s... (or perhaps dx.doi.org is not supposed to be a guaranteed service?)</p>

<p>[Seems it's a DNS issue... That said, the DOI folks are really helpful and suggested using <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/">http://hdl.handle.net/</a> in the interim.]</p>

<p>Something else that looks interesting - a forthcoming <a hrf"http://www.doi.org/tools.html">DOI resolution API</a> - this really will need to be reliable and always live...</p>

<!--
<p>I've just got Word 2003 installed on my desktop machine at work, which means that just as soon as I get a couple of hours spare I'll be having a go at timnkering with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dno2k3ta/html/odc_customizingtheresearchpane.asp">research pane</a>. </p>

<p>If you haven't come across the Research Pane before, My understanding of it is that it can be used to consume web services within the MS Office environment.</p>

<p>Now I don't know whether a convergence of search and authoring environments is going to be useful/useable, or whether it'll just get in the way and I'll carry on using a browser for search related activities when I'm authoring (certainly, it's handy having several tabs open to refer to with results from different pages when I'n writing, and having to switch between Word etc. and FF isn't that much of an overhead), but I feel I ought to give it a go.</p>

<p>So, when I get a chance, I'll have a dabble at writing an extension or two myself (perhaps for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/webService.php">OUseful books webservice for starters</a>) as well as plugging in a few tools for services the OU library subscribes to, such as <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/msoffice/">LexisNexis</a>.</p>

<p>Btw - does anyone know of a similar feature in OpenOffice?</p>

<h3 class="title">Integrating Ad Hoc and Formal Communities</h3>

<!--
<p>By chance, I had a brief chat on Friday  to <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc Eisenstadt</a> and <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/sbs/">Simon Buckinghum Shum</a>, both of <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> about the potential they see for using Web2.0 approaches in the infrastructure that is going to be built around the OU's<br />
<a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/info.html=">Open Content Initiative</a> (if you're interested, here are the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/kmi.html">job ads</a> - if you apply, please mention you found them via the OUseful Blog;-)</p>

<p>One of the things I've had in mind for a bit, but not articulated yet (though I have hinted about it previously in a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005744.html"><em>note to self</em></a> and which I fluffed describing a bit on Friday), is the idea of how we might build learning communities around the OCI content as well as recognising that they are already <em>ad hoc</em> communities that already exist that might also benefit from using OCI materials.</p>

<p>(Marc has commented in the past, for example, how OU students come together in <em>ad hoc</em> communities, e.g. on Yahoo Groups, in addition (I assume) to participating in the 'official' course conferences we run for the majority of our courses.)</p>

<p>One idea I've been mulling around that relates to student use of OCI material (rather than use by other academics or institutional developers (two significant communities that Simon brought to my attention)) is how we might set up user tool profiles that reflect the tools currently used by learner participants.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?<br />
<h3><em>Ad hoc</em> Learning Environments</h3>Well, as I understand OCI, an important part if it is that we'll be offering a learning environment to support OCI, not just making content available. We already support in a small way the forums on <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a>, the site set up jointly with the BBC to provide web support to OU/BBC broadcasts, so I'm guessing that community forums will be an important part of the OCI learning environment offering, along with other social tools.</p>

<p>Just what other tools are going to be included is anyone's guess, but rumour has it that the artificial Chinese Wall that was put up between the OU's Moodle based VLE project and the OCI Environment project is now going to be semi-permeable at least, so I guess we're going to see conversations across it regarding what sort of social/community/participation building tools are going to feature in each project.</p>

<p>The VLE project has student blogs and wikis in mind (and social bookmarking too, I hope!), as well as an eportfolio and so on, and I'd be very surprised if these weren't going to be exploited in community building around OCI (indeed, OCI may well drive VLE tool development), which raises an important quesiton for me that provides some amount of context for user tool profiles, in particular:</p>

<p><em>To what extent will user communities require participants to go to the OCI (or OU VLE) site to join in and to what extent will participants be able to join in from a home context?</em></p>

<p>The <em>home context</em> is not a phrase I'm happy with so here's what I mean by it: those <em>personal</em> tools or clients - web based or on the desktop - that I use day to day. For example, my preferred email client, feed reader, word processor and so on. So perhaps 'personal context' and 'personal tools' would be a better way of saying it.</p>

<p>The home context is thus distinct from, for example, a forum hosted on the OCI site, or a feedreader or blogging tool embedded in the OCI learning enviroment.</p>

<p>Note also that this is not a  PLE - Personal Learning Environment - at least as I currently understand them. That is to say, my understanding of PLEs are that they are   centralised learning environments independent of any instituion. (Instituionally hosted learning environments are usually referred to as VLEs - that is, the assumption is that a VLE is 'owned' by an instituion and populated by its students.) </p>

<p>Instead, I guess what I'm proposing is an <strong><em>ad hoc</em> learning environment</strong> (AHLE), recalling some of the ideas of a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">Portable PLE</a> and indeed more directly a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005744.html">Virtual PLE</a></p>

<p>Now I don't know - and don't really have a feel for - the extent to which community feeling is strengthened by going "somewhere" to participate in a community, but I'm taking the view that we expose people to particulalry tools in a learning environment because they support learning in the (semi)formal course environment <em>and they can also support an individual's informal, lifelong learning in their day-to-day lives</em>.</p>

<p>That is, if we teach students to blog in an OU course because we think it can help their learning, then in part we've failed to prove that point if they don't continue to use the tool <em>after</em> they've completed the course, either in other courses or their daily professional development. (Unless the argument is that the blog is useful scaffolding only at a particular stage of learning development, and is no longer useful after the course it is used in, for example).<br />
 <br />
So - the position I'm starting from (and seems to have taken a long time to get here!) is that some participants in the OCI venture will already be using social/communication tools in a home context and will want to particpate <em>using those home context tools</em> and some will want a place to go to (e.g. the OCI learning environment) to participate. Some will want to mix and match both approaches.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the environment should be able to cope with these different modes in such a way that other particpants don't necessarily how any other people are participating.</p>

<p>This is all a bit confusing, I suspect, so here's an example to try and make it a little more concrete: a blogging community.</p>

<p><h3>A Case in Point: Blogging Communities</h3></p>

<p>As I see it, there are three components required in a blogging system:</p>

<ol><li><strong>a client in which to author the content;</strong></li><li><strong>a system on which to host the content;</strong></li><li><strong>a client with which to view or otherwise consume the content.</strong></li></ol>

<p>(The host provides a wealth of other services including an HTML view of the content, a feed, a persistent URL of a web page of each post, digests (e.g. over time or topic), comments etc.)</p>

<p>These components may be closely integrated, or they may not.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> will provide you with an authoring (content creation) and hosting (content hosting) environment, <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> primarily provides a feed reading (content consumption) environment (although it does also offer blog authoring/hosting), <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Performancing for Firefox</a> (which I'm using now) just allows me to author a post, <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a> is a desktop feedreading client and so on.</p>

<p>Now, a learning environment that encourages learners to blog will probably provide a unified environment for creating, (hosting), and consuming blogs posts. But it is quite possible for others to participate in this community from the home context.</p>

<p>In fact, there are eight (8) discrete configurations for mixing and matching the three blogging components (creation, hosting and consumption) across the 'place-to-go' environment and the home context, as well as a continuum of mixed strategies.</p>

<p>(By mixed strategy, I mean that students may receive, for example, RSS feeds through different clients depending on the sort of information the feed is providing. For example, I may choose to receive news blog announcements in my Google homepage, blog posts from particular blogs to my feedreader, and from other blogs via an RSS2email relay into my email box.)</p>

<p>So what are these configurations?</p>

<table><tbody><tr><th></th><th colspan="3">Go-There Context</th><th colspan="3">Home Context</th></tr>
<tr><th>Configuration</th><th>Content Creation</th><th>Content Hosting</th><th>Content Consumption</th><th>Content Creation</th><th>Content Hosting</th><th>Content Consumption</th></tr>
<tr><th>0</th><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><th>1</th><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td></tr>
<tr><th>2</th><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><th>3</th><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr>
<tr><th>4</th><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><th>5</th><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td></tr>
<tr><th>6</th><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><th>7</th><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So for example, a configuration 0 style user would create, host and read other people's blog posts solely within the OCI learning environment, for example; a configuration 7 user would use there own client, host and feed reader (although their blog feed would perhaps be syndicated to the OCI environment; a configuration 4 user would user their own client  to create content for hosting at OCI, and also use the OCI feed reader, and so on.</p>

<p>At this point it is perhaps recapping the model I am assuming - that there is an OCI content repository and associated with it an OCI learning environment. That learning communities will develop within the learning environment, and as <em>ad hoc</em> communities around the content. That hybrid communites composed of learners using OCI and home context/personal tools should be supported seamlessly (so that, for example, OCI based learners would not not that their some of their peers were using home context/personal tools. (That is, that communities based around OCI 'VLE' and AHLEs should be possible.)</p>

<p><h3>What Services Do Institutionally Hosted Learning Environments Offer?</h3></p>

<p>At this point, it is perhaps worth briefly stating what I think are some of the important features of a centralised learning environment:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Coherent navigation across services/components</strong></li><li><strong>Common styling across services</strong></li><li><strong>Content hosting</strong></li><li><strong>Social networking (groups, like minded people etc.)</strong></li><li><strong>Common authentication across services</strong></li></ol>

<p>(B***r - Performancing crashed in Firefox and lost 500 words...I'll try and recreate, but the rest is now mostly note form...)</p>

<p>To what extent can these components be satisified in an <em>ad hoc</em> tools way? </p>

<p>Consider navigation and style:</p>

<p>- Navigation can come from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003289.html">Sitemaps</a> or <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/09/separating-navigation-from-content-and.html">SiteInfo</a> feeds, or generated from consumed content feeds;</p>

<p>- common style can come from providing templates (e..g Blogger, Typepad or Moveable Type templates) or republishing feeds (e.g. like <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> or <a href="http://suprglu.com">SuprGlu</a>.</p>

<p>The tools we can add to our environment go way beyond just blogging, of course - IM/chat, wikis, collaborative authoring tools, podcasts, social bookmarking etc. etc.</p>

<p>Now at last I'm at the point where I can perhaps start to think about a learning environment profile building tool. Consider for example, a user wants to join a community and participate in it using a personal IM client and feed reader, and a personal blog. The envrionment builder tool would allow them to wire these components together to work within the community (wiring tools might also be provided in a more technical way to developers wanting to work a the level of wiring web services together).</p>

<p>How might this work?</p>

<p>The the tool generates a list of addresses to add to the IM client address book, corresponding to learning community chat rooms or participants, and perhaps add them to the user's messaging service personal profile via an API, as well as adding the user's contact info to the list of participants in the community.</p>

<p>The service subscribes to the user's blog, offers to republish it in the environment skin in a Feedburner like way, and adds it to the OPML reading list for that community.</p>

<p>Finally, the profiler subscribes the user's feedreader to the OPML reading list for feeds relating to the particular learning community the user has just joined.</p>

<p>At the technical/develop level, preconfigured profiles could perhaps defined and made available for personal cloning in a <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> like way - though this then goes back to a centralised PLE model perhaps?</p>

<p>The above is all v rushed and sparse, but I think I have it clearer in my own mind now how to go about building a demo, over and above the gut feeling that a mashed learning environment model is viable.</p>

<p>More on it when I get a chance....</p>

<p>[Note also that I have absolutley nothing to do officially with either the VLE or the OCI project and the above relate just to personal thoughts and doodles.]</p>

<!--
<p>One of the things that I keep coming back to in the area of technological support for elearning is how best to reference online resources in a persistent way.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I fired off a sanity checking email to <a href="http://libraryissues.blogspot.com/">Tim Wales</a>, the Technology Faculty liaison in the OU Library to see if this link pattern: <em>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/</em>whateverDOI worked in general for sites that were registered with the OU <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">ezproxy</a>, the idea being that the <em>ezproxy</em> would handle authentication with commercial database providers.</p>

<p>The thing that was concerning me was that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/">http://dx.doi.org/</a> resolves a DOI to another website, and I wasn't clear whether the libezproxy script would be happy with this.</p>

<p>Well, it does seem to work , but perhaps more interesting was the reply that Tim sent back. In particular, he made the very useful point that using the DOI would not necessarily result in a direct link to content in perpetuity for cases where the OU's subscription to the host of the particular article identfied by the DOI lapsed.</p>

<blockquote>[F]or article linking, I was tending towards considering
advocating the alternative method of using an OpenURL link with our
<a href="http://librarywiki.open.ac.uk/Wiki.jsp?page=LinkfinderPlus">Linkfinder+ resolver</a> [internal link] as it would automatically take users to an
alternative source of the document if one existed thanks to our multiple
subscriptions or present an alternative search options screen. With a
DOI link, if our subscription to the resource expired, the user would
have to know to look on our catalogue for other options or would think
they would have to buy it from the host site.</blockquote>

<p>Tim then went on, it seems, to hack a solution:</p>

<blockquote>The ideal would be to combine the two together and this facility does exist in Linkfinder+. I have just worked this out, this is the combi DOI
openurl link ... :

<p><s>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:<em>theDOI</em></s><br />
err? http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3?&id=doi:<em>theDOI</em>, which then becomes http://openurl.open.ac.uk.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3?id= maybe?</p>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>So - here's a rather neat recipe for: 1) resolving a DOI, 2) against the OU LinkFinder+/OpenURL resolver, and  3) accessing the article via <em>libezproxy</em>.</p>

<p>As an example, (if you're behind SAMS), Tim concludes:</p>

<blockquote>[Here's a link to a database we do subscribe to:] <a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1016/S0040-1625(03)00072-6">http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1016/S0040-1625(03)00072-6</a>

<p>This is an example of what happens with a DOI'd resource that we do not<br />
have access to with our current Linkfinder+ configuration:<br />
<s><a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1">http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1</a></s></p>

<p><a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1">http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1</a></p>

<p><br />
You can see that the Publisher link does take the user to the resource in the end.</blockquote></p>

<p>One thing to note is that not all OpenURL resolved resources will necessarily require libezproxy access (err, is that right?)  - anyway, under that assumption, I have set up a OUseful shortcut - <a href="http://open.ac.uk/doi:">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/doi:</a> - which redirects to <s><em>http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:</em></s> <br />
<em>http://openurl.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3?&id=doi:</em>, enabling LinkResolver resolution of doi queries.</p>

<p><br />
Just while I'm on the topic, here is an <s><a href="http://library11.open.ac.uk/linking/lfp.htm">OpenURL link generator</a>, </s> err - this maybe? <a href="http://openurl.open.ac.uk:3210/sfxlcl3/cgi/core/citation-linker.cgi?rft.genre=article">citation generator</a>?, <s>and here is a link to the <a href="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display">OU Open URL resolver</a>.</s></p>

<p>There are a couple of official LinkResolver graphics, too: <img src="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/images/linkfinderplus.gif" alt="Check for Full Text graphic" /> and <img src="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/images/linkfinderplus2.gif" alt="Anoyther Check for Full Text graphic" /></p>

<p>For finding DOIs, here's a <a href="http://www.crossref.org/03libraries/37guest_query.html">DOI lookup service</a>, and here's a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/">DOI resolver</a> (and <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/">another DOI resolver</a>).</p>

<p>I guess the next thing to do is to get these things working with a <a href="http://curtis.med.yale.edu/dchud/resolvable/">COinS bookmarklet or Greasemonkey script</a>!<br />
 <br />
PS a couple of things that came to mind when trawling items for this post: 1) the same document (?terminology) may be available on several commercial databases, and each database will have it's own DOI for the document- is there an <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/xisbn/default.htm">xISBN</a> equivalent for DOIs (xDOI)? The LinkResolver+ I guess works by looking up the reference of the artcle referenced by a DOI, and then finding a database that the OU subscribes that serves that document - which is not really xDOI, though it has a similar effect. 2)  Using libezproxy results in URLs of the form <em>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/</em>, for example. Does this mean the OU is effectively republishing the <em>ieeexplore.ieee.org</em> site in this case, which is presumably a breach of copyright?</p>

<p>An interesting informal, internal project I found out about a week or two ago that sprang up out of a bet, so I believe (<em>"So Tom if you manage to setup a running system (technology + people) which captures over 50% of what is on the shelves in KMi and maintains this for at least 3 months I'll buy you a bottle of champagne (or equivalent other alcohol)"</em>) which provides a nicely rendered listing of the books in on your shelf given just their ISBN numbers.</p>

<p>The project is called <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk/">Bookshelf</a>, and the way it works is this:</p>

<blockquote>You provide a text file containing the ISBNs of books on your bookshelf. A PHP script then reads the text file, looks up each of the ISBNs using the Amazon.co.uk Web Services API, collects all the results and displays them together in one list. If you're using a recent browser like Firefox then some XSLT code transforms the XML from Amazon into XHTML to provide a human readable version.</blockquote>

<p>If you have OU intranet access you can see a <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=29&whichevent=628">presentation</a> all about it. </p>

<p>The guys who've been developing the Bookshelf (as an aside to their PhD work, apparently - amazing what a postgrad will do for a free drink!) are <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom/">Tom Heath</a> and <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/mark/">Mark Gaved</a> - their day job projects look equally interesting too.</p>

<p>A few days after seeing the demo,  another similar app crossed one of my in-feeds: <a href="http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/archives/001311.html">Delicious Library</a>. SImilar effect, but the execution seems a little more laboured to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, it'll be interesting to see how both of these progress...</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> it'd be neat if the chaps could work <a href="http://blog.mix06.com/virtualmix/archive/2006/03/15/Amazon.aspx">Amazon RSS wishlists</a> into the mix somehow, perhaps brokering who you might borrow books on your wishlist from, based on their bokshelf items?]</p>

<p>PS Just because, anyone interested in this sort of thing who hasn't already come across <a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> should probably go and check it out.</p>

<p>PPS Anyone know if there's anyone looking at a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">book info microformat</a>? [Here's some work on a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/cite">citation microformat</a> and here's the <a href="http://www.openurl.info/registry">OpenURL</a> inspired <a href="http://ocoins.info/cobgbook.html">CoINS book reference</a> description.]</p>

<!--
<p>As requested by <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/03/11/generate-an-opml-for-hyperlinks-on-a-webpage/">Library Clips</a>, here is an <a href="javascript:void(d=document);void(l=d.getElementsByTagName('a'));if (l.length!=0){void(ll=d.createElement('pre'));void(t=d.getElementsByTagName('title'));void(tv=t[0].firstChild.nodeValue);void(o='<opml>\n<head>\n<title>'+tv+'</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n');void(n=d.createTextNode(o));ll.appendChild(n);for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (r.indexOf('http://')==0) {void(r='<outline text=%22'+l[i].firstChild.nodeValue+'%22 type=%22link%22 url=%22'+r+'%22/>\n');void(lt=d.createTextNode(r));void(ll.appendChild(lt));};};void(o='</body>\n</opml>\n\n');void(n=d.createTextNode(o));ll.appendChild(n);void(b=d.getElementsByTagName('body'));void(b[0].appendChild(ll));}">OPMLify Page Links</a> bookmarklet that will find all the links in a page and pop them into an OPML listing that you can cut and paste into a text editor, save (or perhaps prune and save) and then upload to your favourite OPML reader.</p>

<p>The flavour of OPML the bookmarklet egnerates is based on the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001000/gems/publications.opml">Publication</a> style referred to confusingly as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML"><em>Directory</em> Example OPML document on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>As with the previous bookmarklet, I 'v eonly tried the bookmarklet out on a couple of pages viewed in Firefox. Again, there are significant usability/styling issues at the moment, (though you can get an idea of how it could work by looking at this page <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005946.html">here</a> and firing the bookmarklet from with the page by clicking on the <em>OPMLify Page Links</em> link - the OPML appears at the bottom of the page).</p>

<p>Note also that where there is anything other than simple text describing a link (e.g. if the link text is in italics), then the text is not picked up.</p>

<p>The approach would obviously be more useable if the OPML were provided as a file that could be linked to, but I'm still resisting playing with serverside scripts, (though I may start trying a few things out at <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>)..</p>

<p>This is my last bookmarklet for a bit (I hope...;-) and represents a half hour rehash of yesterday's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005929.html">"Link Referencing"</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>(Hmm, that said, perhaps I should spend a few minutes tidying up my recent flurry of bookmarklets, wrapping all the functions in the <em>(function(){})</em> construction so I can get rid of all the <em>void()</em>'s around assisgments).</p>

<p>PS here's a <a href="javascript:void(d=document);void(l=d.getElementsByTagName('a'));if (l.length!=0){void(ll=d.createElement('pre'));void(t=d.getElementsByTagName('title'));void(tv=t[0].firstChild.nodeValue);void(o='<opml>\n<head>\n<title>'+tv+'</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n');void(n=d.createTextNode(o));ll.appendChild(n);for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (l[i].getAttribute('rel')=='bookmark') {void(r='<outline text=%22'+l[i].firstChild.nodeValue+'%22 type=%22link%22 url=%22'+r+'%22/>\n');void(lt=d.createTextNode(r));void(ll.appendChild(lt));};};void(o='</body>\n</opml>\n\n');void(n=d.createTextNode(o));ll.appendChild(n);void(b=d.getElementsByTagName('body'));void(b[0].appendChild(ll));}">version of the bookmarklet</a> customised for John Tropea's Libray Clips front page, that only pulls out the story links on that page....and here's one I'm working on to <a href="javascript:function ct(n,t){return n.createTextNode(t)};function gt(n,t){return n.getElementsByTagName(t)};function ga(n,a){return n.getAttribute(a)};function ac(n,c){n.appendChild(c)};void(d=document);void(l=gt(d,'a'));if (l.length!=0){void(ll=d.createElement('pre'));void(t=gt(d,'title'));void(tv=t[0].firstChild.nodeValue);void(o='<opml>\n<head>\n<title>'+tv+'</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n');void(n=ct(d,o));ac(ll,n);for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=ga(l[i],'href'));if (r) if (l[i].getAttribute('rel')=='bookmark') {void(r='<outline text=%22'+l[i].firstChild.nodeValue+'%22 type=%22link%22 url=%22'+r+'%22/>\n');void(lt=ct(d,r));ac(ll,lt);};};void(o='</body>\n</opml>\n\n');void(n=ct(d,o));ac(ll,n);void(b=gt(d,'body'));ac(b[0],ll);}">tidy up the js code</a> prior to addressing the styling of the OPML result...</p>

<hr />Another off topic post, but I can't resist... While the Grand Prix was on yesterday, I wondered whether F1 (Formula One motor racing) had got into the spirit of APIs and data feeds for circuit timing, team telemetry, team radio feeds and so on.<br /><br />I couldn't get in to register for the <a href="http://www.formula1.com/">official F1 live timing</a> site - the site was too busy - but I did find a nice feature on the <a href="http://www.renaultf1.com/en/">Renault F1</a> site which had a stylised plan view of the Bahrain  circuit and the two Renault cars plotted on it in real time. It was quite something to watch the car drive into the pits on the TV and see it stop in the pits on the interactive map at the same time, and then for both of them to set off again in synch...<br /><br />The scope for playing with real time data once a fortnight or so for a couple of hours for 6 months of the year is immense - if the teams and/or F1 could be persuaded to make it available.<br /><br />F1 is one of <em>the</em> technology demonstrators, as well as a driver (pun intended) for computer games - though I don't play games, I can see how the 'driver cam' on the real cars gives a view surprisingly like that provided in a driving game.<br /><br />We don't have digital TV where I live (not countng Sky or Freesat - but why <em>should</em> I have to install a satellite dish?) but perhaps if we did I could press red to get the driver cam of whichever driver I wanted, along with their team radio? Anyway, it'd be nice to get that sort of feed over the web... I could easily imagine people paying a quid or two to drive with Schumacher or Alonso for the duration of the race, just for the novely of it the first time, watching the driver cam on their laptop with the race on the telly!<br /><br />(I think there could be something in this - a two screen appraoch to watching televised events: one for the telly, one for the user switched interactive data feeds - yes, you too can play at beiong in the pits alongside the technical crew, looking at the data screens, trying to work out the strategy etc! Same with cricket, or tennis - check the stats out on the players, get a <a href="http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/">HawkEye</a> replay of every shot etc.<br /><br />Now you can participate in a sporting event by doing the real time analysis yourself!<br /><br />Anyway, back to the technology demonstrator element of F1 - just thing of the scope for testing realtime AJAX apps if F1 could make the data available realtime?:-)<br /><br />So - if you know where there are any F1 race day live data feeds, please drop me a line...</p>

<h3 class="title">Chatting About Web Pages: Just Another Form of Annotation?</h3>

<!--
<p>I've been wondering over he last few days the extent to which chat might be a useful mechanism for annotating web pages compared to more 'traditional techniques (such as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005006.html">these</a>).</p>

<p>So when I read <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008884.html">this post</a> from <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/">Russell Beattie</a> this morning, which mentions his various experiments with IM-enhanced blog pages over the years, I thought I should pop a few thoughts down on the matter, idling around how we could make use of chat in our online courses.</p>

<p>This is all very of timely of course - over the last few days I've had my invite to <a href="http://3bubbles.com">3bubbles</a> which <em>"unites chat and blogs to create real-time conversations in the blogosphere"</em> (though as yet I haven't added one of their chats to any of my pages), had a quick play with <a href="http://gabbly.com">Gabbly</em> (which you can use to <a href="http://gabbly.com/ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">chat about the OUseful blog</a> if you like) and taken note of <a href="http://blog.jalenack.com/ajax/"><em>"[t]his Wordpress plugin [which] adds live chat functionality to your Wordpress blog"</em></a>.</p>

<p>I also read somewhere (I forget where) about IM being the 'Hello World' of AJAX and then turned up this <a href="http://www.ajaxprojects.com/ajax/tutorialdetails.php?itemid=9">AJAX Chat Tutorial</a> which gives a pretty good overview of what's involved in getiing a minimal chat system up and running using AJAX.</p>

<p>The idea of using chat as a way of annotating web pages also ties in with a previous idle about using the pages containing external links as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005914.html">search hubs</a>.</p>

<p>Particular pages can potentially be used in elearning as a focus for discussion, and this is one area where being able to annotate, or chat around, a page almost <em>in situ</em> could potentially be very interesting indeed. (This whole area is now very firmly on my <em>must think properly about this</em> list!)</p>

<p>There is an issue, of course, in fact - several issues - about using public services such as Gabbly as the basis for a learning activity within a particular (fee paying!) cohort. For example - the third party site QoS or even lifetime cannot be guaranteed; the service is likely to be public - and hence open to spam, or pointless posting, or require site specific authentication; and so on (I reviewed several of the issues insofar as they relate to social bookmarking <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>More generally, it's currently a live issue in the OU about how we integrate discussion about particular web pages (either e-learning content pages we deliver as part of a course, or arbitrary third party pages we are using as the focus of discussion) into contentful pages (if indeed that's possible). Online discussion is widely used to support many OU courses, though typically the discussion environment has only been very loosely coupled to the learning content environment. I suspect that there is a feeling that a tighter degree of integraion would be useful though (no references I'm afraid) - or at least worth exploring - so for my money a consideration of chat like commenting on pages should be one of the things we consider.</p>

<p>(It's perhaps worth saying at this point that I've only chatted a few times - IM is not my favourite thing - but I do recognise that at least for our incoming 'younger students' (aged 18-25, an increasing market for the OU whose numbers have traditionally come more from mature students) chat-like interfaces are increasingly something they'd expect to find in an online community. And if we step back for just a second and ask why we use online conferencing in our courses, I think we'd have to admit that first and foremost it was to devleop a supportive virtual community.</p>

<p>(This is something else I think I need to think about - the OU has arguably pioneered the use of online conferencing, at scale, in HE, but htings are very different now compared to even 203 years ago, as the rapid growth in online communities shows (witness the growth in popoularity of <a href="http://myspace.com">MySpace</a>, which I'm sure last year was seen as being overpriced, but whose traffic is now growing at a stupendous rate).)</p>

<p>Anyway, back on topic: several of our online courses have experimented with allowing students to post thoughts/comments about a topic either individually or communally from within a page at a particular point, and then see the posts submitted by others, or perhaps allow the student to revisit their private individual comments at a later date.</p>

<p>In our <a href="http://nagty.open.ac.uk/">NAGTY online academic study groups</a>, we have explored linking out from content pages to First Class discussion threads (as described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005529.html">this presentation</a>) but so far I'm not sure how successful this has been in terms of student experience.</p>

<p>So one thing I think I'd like to explore is just how we might use chat as another channel for discussion. There are times when this won;t be appropriate of course - for example, online conferences do allow for the development of quite lengthy and considered commentaries which just would not work in a chat setting. But at other times, some conference threads can be quite chatty (and really painful to read too when there are lots of 'me too' type messages in a thread).</p>

<p>For group work, too, the informality of chat may be useful in particular stages of group formation. </p>

<p>One thing worth noting at this point is that page based chat need not necessarily be synchronous - Gabbly for example logs you in to the state of a discussion about a page that has happened to date, as well as providing an RSS feed of the transcript which looks like it could be quite useful (for example, allowing integration with a more signinificant dicussion/conferencing environment).</p>

<p>Something I should perhaps mention is the great work done by our Faculty FirstClass administrator Ches Lincoln today. I'd posted a note to the departmental discussion conference about how it may be interesting to try out chat as a page discussion channel, got the usual lack of replies except the expected pedantic one, then got an email to say how Ches had set up a demo/prototype page annotation scheme using the FirstClass chat facility, which was absoultely unexpected and utterly brilliant, exactly the sort of thing we should be doing in an ICT department I'd have thought?!;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, the app had a lot of what we need for a managed environment - the ability to remember the discussion, save (export?) the thread, even moderate the users - although admittedly the usability of the default templates is - how shall I say it - rather painful (the no AJAX, frame based interface makes for regular annoying flashes every few seconds as frames refresh).<br />
 <br />
We'll be working out the usablility and user model of the FC driven page based chat over the next day or two, and will perhaps try working it into the NAGTY environment (soemthing we had discussed before in general terms, but not in the sense of a page based discussion). If there's anything to report off the back of it, I'll do it here...</p>

<h3 class="title">Link Referencing Bookmarklet</h3>

<!--
<p>Today's half hour bookmarklet hack is inspired (again) by Library Clips, this time with respect to a request for <a href='http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/03/13/a-list-of-hyperlink-urls-for-a-printed-webpage/'>A list of hyperlink URL's for a printed webpage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Do you ever have a problem when reading a printed page from a blog or a website that you come across a word that has an underline under it as it is a hyperlink, and you wonder where does this link tonot only can you not launch to this hyperlink, but you dont even know its URLso the printed page is very limited in this aspect.

<p>... I would like to hit a bookmarklet to generate a list of hyperlinks on a given webpage, and then secondly be able to print this as a numbered list of hyperlinks placed at the end of the print out, and each number would match up to an annotated number on each hyperlink in the body of the page.</blockquote></p>

<p>OK - here's a quick attempt: <a href="javascript:void(d=document);void(l=d.getElementsByTagName('a'));if (l.length!=0){void(ll=d.createElement('ul'));var j=1;for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (r.indexOf('http://')==0) {void(a=' ['+j+']');void(n=d.createTextNode(a));void(l[i].appendChild(n));void(li=d.createElement('li'));void(r='['+j+'] '+r);void(j++);void(lt=d.createTextNode(r));void(li.appendChild(lt));void(ll.appendChild(li));};};void(b=d.getElementsByTagName('body'));void(b[0].appendChild(ll));}">LinkRefs</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>The bookmarklet (only tested (?err, not quite, tried out on a couple of pages where it sort of works)) as ever on Firefox will add a reference number to every anchor tag (&lt;a&gt; with an <em>href</em> attribute starting <em>http://</em>, and then print a numbered reference list of URLs at the end of the page.</p>

<p>There are some severe styling issues, as trying out the bookmarklet on John's post shows, but at other times the effect can be almost useful (e.g. try the bookmarklet out on  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/cat_projects.html">this page</a>).</p>

<p>My laptop isn't connected to a printer, so I don't know what happens if you print the page (i.e. whether the dynamically added annotations are sent to the printer, or just the original page. (Please let me know if you try it out whether it works for printing or not).</p>

<p>For this to be useable, I think you'd need to find a way of working out - and specifying easily - which links you want automatically referencing, and how to display them in a page rich with CSS layout features.</p>

<p>I guess it could work in a templated environment, e.g. where you know the page structure and can perhaps just pull out links in a content area wrapped by a <em>div</em> tag with a particular <em>id</em>.</p>

<p>One thing this bookmarklet suggests to me is that being able to rapidly prototype bookmarklets/mini applications can help in refining user requiements.</p>

<p>So for example, how might the <a href='http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/03/13/a-list-of-hyperlink-urls-for-a-printed-webpage/'>orginal, informal bookmarklet</a> spec be refined given the problems turned up by the rapid prototype? ;-)</p>

<!--
<p><a href="http://datamining.typepad.com">Matthew Hurst</a> has just written an interesting post about <a href="http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2006/03/strategic_idea_.html">Google's (lack of) GUI innovation</a>, which suggests that:</p>

<blockquote>Google doesn't own any other search interface innovations, so if they started using new ideas here, they would expose themselves to risk from every other search engine out there. There would be a feeding frenzy on the next UI brand. By keeping their interface simple, they force the competition to compete with their brand.</blockquote>

<p>I think there's something to this, but I also think that users like the simple life. For example, Yahoo keeps coming out with interesting innovations that don't seem to get widely adopted. A case in point? I was intrigued by <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/">Y!Q Contextual Search</a> when I first heard about it, installed the <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/publisher/firefox.html">Y!Q Firefox <s>toolbar</s> extension</a> etc. but do I use the functionality? Nahhhhhhh...it's easier just to use the search box on my browser toolbar. After all, that's where I usually go to search.</p>

<p>The area that has been particularly interesting me for a bit is <em>bounded search</em> - that is, search within a limited range of web pages or domains.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo.com</a> for example, where you can essentially define a search roll of sites to search. It's the sort of thing <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> could offer too, or any of the other 'lensing' sites like <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H20 Playlists</a>, but I don't think it/they does/do (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005493.html">here</a> for more).</p>

<p>In an attempt to clarify my thinking on this, I've started mulling over the phrase <em>search hub</em> (rather than <em>searchroll</em> for example) to see what it suggests to me (one of my favourite brainstorming techniques is to invent a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:neologism">neologism</a> and then unpack it/see what it suggests or brings to mind).</p>

<p>So for example, in a variety of recent doodles, such as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html">deliSearch</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005899.html">Search Pagelinks</a>, I've considered using a feed of delicious bookmarks, or the links on a page, as the set of resources over which a search should be applied (I guess <em>search set</em> or, recalling the above, <em>search lens</em>, could also be used instead of <em>search hub</em>?)</p>

<p>(Hmm - I'm also reminded of the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/popupLinks.html">popup linkset</a>(?) script, (effect described <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">here</a>), and the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/searchLink.html">searchLink</a> code, both of which I really need to get working ptoperly, tidy up, sort out the styling etc., and make useable... )</p>

<p>What's the point? Well, I'm working on it. Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be doodling some elearning activities that make use of <em>search hubs</em> or whatever they end up being called, both faculty and student created - and posting related thoughts to the OUseful blog, of course - so if anybody out there is working on/using something similar, please email me.</p>

<!--
<p>Borrowing a few things from Otis' <a href="http://www.simpy.com/tools">Simpy Bookmarklet</a>, I've modified the <em>Search This Page's Links</em> bookmarklet so that if you don't highlight a term then it will offer you a pop-up search box to enter your search terms.</p>

<p>As IE seems to limit the length of a bookmarklet, I'm working on shortening the bookmarklet, so the bookmarklet code provided from this page may undergo a few changes over the next few days.</p>

<p>(At the moment, <s>the bookmarklet does not work in IE [Testing: <a href="javascript:void(l=document.getElementsByTagName('a'));if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') > 0) {q = document.selection.createRange().text;}; if (!q) {void(q = prompt('Search pageLinks:', ''));};void(m='http://search.yahoo.com/search?p='+q+' (');if (l.length>0){for (i=0; i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (r.indexOf('http://')==0) if (m.length<1350) void(m+=' url:'+l[i].getAttribute('href')+'%20OR%20');else break;};void(m+=')');void(window.location=m);}">IE bookmarklet</a> ?broken?]</s>). <strong>Update:</strong> Here's a quick fix - a bookmarklet that doesn't look for selected text - instead it will <em>always</em> pop up a search box for you to enter search terms that will be used to search over the links in the page: <a href="javascript:void(d=document);void(l=d.getElementsByTagName('a')); void(q=prompt('Search pageLinks:',''));void(m='http://search.yahoo.com/search?p='+q+' (');if (l.length>0){for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (r.indexOf('http://')==0) if (m.length<1350) void(m+=' url:'+r+'%20OR%20');else break;};void(m+=')');void(window.location=m);}">Search PageLinks</a>.</p>

<p><s>Anyway</s> if you're using Firefox (?or Safari?) - here's the new <a href="javascript:void(d=document);void(l=d.getElementsByTagName('a'));void(n=navigator);void(na=n.userAgent);if ((na.indexOf('MSIE')>0)||(na.indexOf('Safari')>0)) {q=d.selection.createRange().text;} else {q=d.getSelection();};if (!q) {void(q=prompt('Search pageLinks:',''));};void(m='http://search.yahoo.com/search?p='+q+' (');if (l.length>0){for (i=0;i<l.length; i++) {void(r=l[i].getAttribute('href'));if (r) if (r.indexOf('http://')==0) if (m.length<1350) void(m+=' url:'+r+'%20OR%20');else break;};void(m+=')');void(window.location=m);}">? PageLinks</a> bookmarklet (this one, unlike the IE version, will use selected text if there is any as the search term(s)). <strong>Aaarghhh</strong> - I keep forgetting, Bloglines thinks the &lt; sign in the bookmark is the start of a tag (?anyone know how  Ishould get round this?) - if you want to play, and your are in Bloglines at the mo, pick up the bookmarks from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005913.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of features added since last time: 1) the <s>size of the bookmarklet is limited</s> number of links searched over is limited by the maximum length of the Yahoo search URL that is generated; 2) only links starting <em>http://</em> are considered.</p>

<p>PS Don't forget, if you want to include a 'search the links on this page' search box in your own page, there's a script that will do it <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005899.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>At last the public announcement has been made - the OU will be getting into open content in a reasonably big way, thanks in part to a grant from the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">Hewlett Foundation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The Open University revolutionised assumptions about who could learn, and how they could learn.

<p>Now we're doing it again.</p>

<p>The Open Content Initiative (OCI) will make educational resources freely available on the Internet, with state of the art learning support and collaboration tools to connect students and educators.</blockquote></p>

<p>The OU is also part of the <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/">Creative Archive</a> project, though I'm not sure how these relate (perhaps CA will be a subset of OCI?)</p>

<p>(Apparently, it seems that work done last year identifying a learning delivery system for the OCI had more than a little to do with the choice of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=7354">Moodle to be used as the new OU VLE</a>...)</p>

<!--
<p>Just a quick pick up on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005897.html"><em>Search This Page's Links</em> bookmarklet</a> (<strong>updated version <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005913.html">here</a></strong>) to say that I've popped the code used in the bookmarklet into a Javascript file (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchPageLinks.js"><em>Search Page Links</em> form script</a>) so that a search box can now be easily added to a page that will let you enter a search term that can be used in a Yahoo search over all the pages linked to from the current page:</p>

<p><script type='text/javascript' src='searchPageLinks.js'> </script></p>

<p>It's easy enough to include the script. Just add this to the body of your page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='searchPageLinks.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>I haven't thought about styling/positioning, making the script robust etc., but if anyone does try it out, has comments, bugs etc., please mail me. (In particular, I need to pop the functions into a namespace so they don't clash with similarly named functions on my own blog pages! (I think that's why the form doesn't work on my blog homepage, becuase it does seem to work elsewhere...))</p>

<p>Possible things to include function/usability wise if I take this any further are:</p>

<ul><li>a listing of all the links to be searched;</li>
<li>a checkbox by each so you can (de)select it from the pages to be searched;</li>
<li>a (de)select all button to ease the link (de)selection process.</li></ul>

<p>I also need to miss out links that start <em>javascript:</em> rather than <em>http://</em> in the list of links to be searched. <strong>Update: fixed</strong>.</p>

<p>PS I also limited the length of the Yahoo search URL which means that not all the links will be included on the page (perhaps making it more important that I provide some meams of showing what links are to be searched?)</p>

<p>I also wonder whether it would be better to require each link to be searched to be given a particular class value (<em>searchable</em> perhaps?), e.g. something along the lines of:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href="http://example.com/my/path.html" class="searchable"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>Something I seem to remember reading about in the past, and brought to mind again today in an email about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html">deliSearch</a> from John Tropea at <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com">Library Clips</a>, who wrote:</p>

<blockquote>hopefully someone will come along and make a search engine that searches the full-text of the links listed on a given URL (webpage).</blockquote>

<p>Rather than spend 20 mins googling for something to do this, I thought I'd spend half an hour on a proof of concept bookmarklet to do something along these lines.</p>

<p>So here it is - only tested in Firefox, of course ;-) a possibly brittle bookmarklet that will allow you to highlight some text on a page and then search all the links on the page for that term.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:void(l=document.getElementsByTagName('a'));void(myURL='http://search.yahoo.com/search?p='+window.getSelection()+' (');if (l.length>0){for (i=0; i<l.length; i++) {void(myURL+=' url:'+l[i].getAttribute('href')+'%20OR%20');};void(myURL+=')');void(window.location=myURL);}">Search This Page's Links</a></p>

<p>(Hmm - Bloglines doesn;t like this - if you're on bloglines, you can pick up the bookmarklet from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005897.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>When I have an hour or two spare, I'll try and pop this into a more robust script that will also add a 'search the links on the page' query form. Unless someone out there already has something similar?</p>

<p>One of the things I've written about several times before are 'livelinks' - lists of links fed live from a social bookmarking system and embedded in a piece of teaching material, for example, as might be the case for a list of <em>Further Reading</em> items.</p>

<p>Developing the idea of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html">DeliSearch</a> a bit further, here's a demo of how to include a seachable list of links in a web page.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliciousJSONdemo.html">Embedded Searchable Further Reading List Demo</a></p>

<p>To include a searchable list of delicious links in your own page, all you need to include are:</p>

<p>- A link to a <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/json">delicious JSON feed</a>; for example, in the demo I include a list of links from my delicious bookmarks tagged <em>web2.0</em>:</p>

<p><em>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/psychemedia/web2.0?count=20" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em></p>

<p>- A link to a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchList.js">script</a> that will display the links in your page, add a search box, construct and execute the search query (via Yahoo); </p>

<p><em>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="searchList.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em></p>

<p>- An optional link to a style file:</p>

<p><em>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="deliciousJSONdemo.css" /&gt;</em></p>

<p>If you view the source of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliciousJSONdemo.html">demo</a>, you'll see there's nothing else there aside from these three includes other than the various HTML constructions that would be around in any web page. </p>

<!--
<p>One of the useful facilities offered by the OU library is the ability to log in to a wide variety of subscription based services (databases and journal collections, for example) via the OU common authentication system.<br /><br />This is achieved at the OU by defining links of the form: <br /><br /><i>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://whatever.service.you/want/to/get/access.to</i><br /> <br />presumably usinga variant of <a href="http://www.usefulutilities.com/">Useful Utilities' ezproxy script</a>, which allows the Library to define all sorts of <a href="http://www.usefulutilities.com/support/rewrite.html">rewriting rules</a> to log the user into the desired system.<br /><br />partly because it's Friday lunchtime, I thought I'd spend a minute or two knocking up a bookmarklet that will  - sometimes - log me in to a site requiring authentication <a href="javascript:void(h='http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=');void(h+=location.href);window.location=h;">via OU libezproxy</a>. (&lt;- That's it, just there, the bookmarklet; just drag it onto your bookmark toolbar, and when you click on it it will try and log you int to the current page via the OU's libezprxoy service.)<br /><br />If you're interested in writing your own, all it does is this: <em>javascript:void(h='http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=');void(h+=location.href);window.location=h;</em>).<br /><br />Now sometimes it work, sometimes it doesn't. If you have an OU SAMS ID, or even better - if you're already logged in to the OU via SAMS - have a look <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00043702">here</a> and see what happens to the subscription status of the journal issues when you click on the bookmarklet. </p>

<h3 class="title">Voyager Library Catalogue Toolbar</h3>

<!--
<p>Having worked out how to include an Options/Preferences dialogue in a Firefox extension (I'll post a tutorial if I get a chance), I've updated the OUseful OU Library toolbar for Firefox so that a user can now store their Library card details and click through&nbsp; to their Library record with a single click from the toolbar.</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarOptions1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarOptions1_3.JPG" width="217" height="409" border="0" /></p>

<p>I've also changed the look of the toolbar back to all text buttons, rather than images. </p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbar1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbar1_3.JPG" width="761" height="32" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is in part taking a lead from the Library official library website, which has been redesigned to be more in keeping with out current brand guidelines and which has&nbsp; dropped the large yellow icon used previously to identify the <em>Librarian On Call</em> instant messaging service.</p>

<p>The <em>Library Lookup</em> uses a version of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookupGenerator.html">Udell's library lookup bookmarklet</a> to extract an ISBN number from the URL of a currently loaded page (for example, an Amazon book page) and search the OU Voyager library for that book.</p>

<p>I believe that another OU Library front page redesign is on the cards, so it maybe worth my time doodling a few thoughts about how it may be improved here, just in case anyone from the library happens to subscribe to the OUseful feed!;-)</p>

<p>(If you haven't see the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk">OU Library homepage</a>, check out the link. In my opinion, it's a bit cluttered? The first thing I think I'd do would be to make the most of any currently set authentication cookies (which identify my role - staff, student etc.) and only offer me links that are relevant on the front page.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the topic of my unofficial toolbar, several shortcuts are provided via a dropdown list to OU Library related webpages. I'm still not sure what should go on this list:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarLinks1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarLinks1_3.JPG" width="154" height="169" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Searches menu allows you to make a search using a selected collection/index. The Voyager button also forces a search using the term(s) in the search text vbox, on the OU <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk">Voyager Library catalogue</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarSearchButtons1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarSearchButtons1_3.JPG" width="378" height="82" border="0" /></p>

<p>The user customisation dialogue:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarConfig1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarConfig1_3.JPG" width="603" height="191" border="0" /></p>

<p>enables an automatic login to <em>My Library Record</em> without the user having to manually fill in the required <a href='http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=pbLogon'>login form</a> (the button completes and submits the form automatically).</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarMyButtons1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarMyButtons1_3.JPG" width="202" height="33" border="0" /></p>

<p>The <em>My Open Library</em> link makes use of the OU's common SAMS authentication scheme to take the user to the correct My Open Library page.</p>

<p>If you want to try out the extension, you can install it from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.13.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.13.xpi');return false;">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next on the to do list for the toolbar are a couple more personalisation tools which will allow a user to add links to an additional library website - most OU students make use of an academic library near to them for book loans, and the OU library for access to online collections, ebooks etc. A couple of switches would allow this address to be used as the primary address for a library catalogue search or <em>Library Lookup</em>.</p>

<p>(If you are an OU student, and you do try out the toolbar, please get in touch and let me know what you think about it - for good or bad...)</p>

<p>This additional customisation will also pave the way for a generic library toolbar which will allow the user to configure the toolbar for use with their own Library system. </p>

<p>What I'm thinking off at the moment are options to: define 3 or four links in the dropdown links menu; customise two drop down search options, the primary library catalogue search button and the target for the <em>Library Lookup</em>; customise the <i>Librarian On Call</i> contact button; customise the My Library Record Link (this may depend on the particular catalogue system). The <i>My Open Library</i> button would go.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in trying out a customised version for your own library, please email me with details of the links/services you'd like included - especially if they differ markedly from my generalisation/customisation thoughts above - and I'll see what I can do in terms of getting a customised toolbar to you (feel free to hack the extension code yourself, of course - but please let me know if you do:-). This information will also help me work out just what to put into a generic, user customised toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: laterst version is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi">OU Library 1.3.1</a>; install it from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi');return false;">here</a>.</p>
