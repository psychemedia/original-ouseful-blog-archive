<h3 class="title">Google Certified Professional</h3>

<p>WIth the increasing numbers of (free) web based office productivity tools, as well as Microsoft and Google's moves <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">towards hosting academic email accounts</a>, I wonder when we'll start seeing <em>Google Certified Professionals</em> (in addition to their <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/professionalwelcome">Google Advertising Pofessionals</a>) lending sage advice to SMEs about how to get the most from <a href="http://mail.google.com">GMail</a>, the <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>, <a href="http://writely.com">Writely</a> and so on? (<strong>Update:</strong> err, oops, that's in addition to promoting best <em>search</em> practice of course (which we'll be doing in <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120  Beyond Google</a>!))</p>

<p>This needn't be limited to Google of course - the Microsoft Live product suite continues to roll out, and the other member of the GYM - Yahoo - also provide comprehensive email and calendaring facilities. Which suggests the need, perhaps, for an 'independent web office applications advisor' who can take you through the vagaries of selecting an appropriate mix of online tools, as well as providing the training necessary to use them effectively.</p>

<p>(For a 'free' independent advisor model, I guess there'd have to be a level playing field in terms of <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/referrals">referral payments</a>?)</p>

<p>I suspect this is not the sort of thing covered in our new <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T121_8_0">Information and Communication Technologies at Work (T121)</a> course, but I wonder - is there a place for it someone in our level 1 offering?</p>

<p>The changing landscape also reminds me of the OU course <a href="http://t171.open.ac.uk/info/">T171 You, Your Computer and the Net: Learning and Living in the Computer Age</a> which met a real need at the turn of the millenium helping people get online and providing basic web literacy skills.</p>

<p>(This course has largely been superceded by <a href="http://t175.open.ac.uk/">T175 Networked Living: Exploring Information and Communication Technologies</a> and several courses on the <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge Technology Short Course Programme</a>.)</p>

<p>With the promise of social software, feed based subscription, pushed content, synchronisation of data between web applications and mobile devices, and effective collaborative online working, I wonder whether there is an opportunity for <em>T171.1 - Making the Net Work for You</em>?</p>

<p>And another couple of years down the line, when the penetration of broadband has increased a bit more and institutions like the BBC (but not, I suspect, the OU;-) will be making ever increasing amounts of multimedia content available for download, I suspect there'll be another opportunity, educating people how to make the most of their digital pipes.</p>

<p>PS have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4339519.stm"><em>digital plumbing services</em></a> started appearing in the Yellow Pages yet, I wonder?</p>

<p>PPS Seems like Google are getting into the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/?p=3767">SEO training</a> with the "<a href='http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/resources/training/university/seminars/search_engine.shtml'>Web Manager University</a>".</p>
