<div class="blogbody">

<h3 class="title">(Not?) Talking about Multimedia</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I put together <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html">We Ignore Digital Media at OU Peril - the Movie</a> earlier in the week is that it occurred to me that the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html">original post</a> was too long for a blog post really. Many people skim blogs for a quick info fix, but to go through the original post comprehensively would take about an hour if you watched the movies and followed all the links.</p>

<p>The movie is not much quicker to watch - but it is a different "user proposition": in this case, a (longish) video show...</p>

<p>It also occurred to me that we make HUGE assumptions about how our students spend time consuming our materials; if we have them for two hours at a time, or even for 1 hour, that would be a huge privilege. I have some reason to believe (;-) that some students on our online courses spend on average 15 minutes per visit to the course website (though I'm not sure how representative that simple average (mean, I think) is of the actual time spent on the site by actual individuals).</p>

<p>Many of our course materials are written with different size chunks in them - readings that take an hour, exercises that take half an hour, SAQs that take maybe 5 mins, maybe longer etc.</p>

<p>BUT there is no way a student can easily grab a bundle of 5 min chunks to consume while they're waiting at the bus stop, for example.</p>

<p>I think  - if we're clever - we may be able to chunk content in such a way that is can be packaged as shorts - a five minute clip with a bit of supporting text to frame why we're using the clip/what we want students to try and get out of the clip/what we want them to think about while they are watching it - or bundling those shorts into a longer package that generates its own momentum and keeps you engaged for a longer study period.</p>

<p>That is, I feel there ought to be a way we can come up with a menu of learning items that can be "snacked on" throughout the day, or sat down to for a full all-in-one-sitting "meal".</p>

<p>(Retaining the food imagery, the <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/">'Ever Wondered About Food?'</a> OU/BBC programme works like that, I think. A half hour program on a single topic/theme, with individual packages that each last 5/6 mins(?) and can be shown as standalone shorts, if required? Just in passing, several episodes of Ever Wondered About Food? also happen to be available as MP3 downloads: <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/podcasts.html">ever wondered about food? "podcast" page</a>. )</p>

<p>My formal training in media studies etc is zero - so this may all be so much nonsense. But then again, developing visual narrative skills internally, and via course offerings, is something I think we should be doing, so I'm happy to be self-experimenting on this... ;-)</p>

<p>Although something like the "peril movie" is NOT meant to demonstrate a potential vehicle for delivery (or assessment) in its current format - there is arguably too little critical analysis for that (although finding appropriate movies can be difficult at times) - it is partly intended  to offer a start to ways in which we might explore how several multimedia clips from the web can be bundled into a chunk that lasts 10 mins,  20 mins, 30 mins, an hour etc. with textual inserts used to hint at a narrative structure.</p>

<p>I mailed some of the above comments around various people internally, as well as to the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/eating/">EATING</a> group (ha! - food again...;-) and it turned up in response a few pointers to people who were already experimenting with such things.</p>

<p>It also turned up a couple of multimedia annotation tools that are being explored for potential use in the context of a particular online open content project...<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://diver.stanford.edu/what.html">DIVER</a>: "DIVER is a tool for authoring and sharing DIVES. A DIVE is an annotated perspective on any video record. Content can be captured by equipment ranging from basic consumer video cameras to specially built, high-resolution 360-degree panoramic cameras with a multi-microphone array."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.matrix.msu.edu/~mmatrix/">[mediamatrix]</a>: "MediaMatrix is an online application that allows users to isolate, segment, and annotate digital media."</li></ul></p>

<p>Internal readers may also like to check out the <a href="https://intranet-gw.open.ac.uk/lts/production-process/9500_media.htm">video narrative explorer</a> developed for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/da204">Understanding Media</a> course, as well as the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/observationskills/p4_5.shtml">fOCUs video annotation tool</a> developed for an observational psychology course (<em>why</em> is there no video demo of this available...?!)</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to explore the various tools that are out there for cobbling together video resources from public sources, here are a few more to get you started:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.vuvox.com/">Vuvox</a>, a online presentation builder. Add flickr photos, youTube movies etc to a customised online presentation;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.scenemaker.net/">Scenemaker</a> lets you edit <em>any</em> YouTube movie, whereas the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ytremixer_about">"official" YouTube Remixer</a> (built on top of Adobe Premiere Express, which also underpins the <a href="http://press.photobucket.com/blog/2007/03/remix_service_a.html">Photobucket online movie remix tool</a>... hmmm....) only lets you edit/remix your <em>own</em> movie uploads (at the moment...).</li><br />
<li><a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a>, the service I used to deliver the peril movies. Add multiple YouTube movies to a show in one go if they are on the same page (like a playlist page...), Powerpoint presentations (each slide becomes a separate image - handy if you want ot rearrange them or insert movies etc.), Flickr images and even PDFs...</li></ul></p>
