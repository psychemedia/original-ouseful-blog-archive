<h3 class="title">O'Reilly SafariU</h3>

<p>On Wednesaday, we had a presenation from <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2427">CJ Rayhill</a>, CIO at O'Reilly's <a href="http://safariu.com">SafariU</a> 'self-service, text book on demand' website. Here are some lightly edited notes from the session...</p>

<p><em>How could O'Reilly help out in academic publishing?</em></p>

<p>Been around for 25 yrs, now a media company, not just a book publisher.<br />
As well as printed content, are O'Reilly are into <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">conferences</a> and developer communities (like <a href="http://www.onlamp.com">ONLamp.com</a> and <a href="http://xml.com/">XML.com</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://sarafiu.com">SafariU</a> is a free service to academia, providing free access to O'Reilly materials, mix and match contact, also in assocation with academic's own material, delivery in print or online. SafariU also includes a learning object exchange, plus shareable playlists.</p>

<p>SafariU driven by the idea that there must be a better way to deliver reference materials to students than high cost textbooks.</p>

<p>Consultation with users (academics?) suggests they desire:</p>

<p>- One stop shop<br />
- Mix and match<br />
- Upload own materials<br />
- Combine materials<br />
- Online or print<br />
- Share compilations</p>

<p>O'Reilly-<br />
Online library (safari books online 50% owned each O'Reilly and Pearson) - separate to O'Reilly<br />
<a href="http://www.bvdep.com/">Bureau van Dijk</a>, Belgium, host <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p>SafariU - went into beta 01/2005, redesigned from ground up following beta</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> XML server is the core component at heart of SafariU.</p>

<p>SafariU came out of beta 3/06 - <a href="http://www.safariu.com">www.safariu.com</a></p>

<p><em>Business model:</em> free to academics, but student body must consume a certain amount of material ($700 per year) over the course of a year. O'Reilly sell print-on-demand (POD) versions of textbooks to resellers (e.g. campus  bookshop) $0.16 per page (print); or online service (pay-per-time)).</p>

<p>If course uses e.g. material from several books and articles, with snippets of material provided by instructor, the student sees links to the full source books (presumabaly so they can then read/buy into those).</p>

<p>So the student pays to access the content...[hmm - in OU, we tend to provide the majority of third party content, e.g. course readers etc. as part of course, though there is a mixed model across OU wrt text books being bundled with course materials or student self-purchased.]</p>

<p>But there are also corporate payment/access mechanisms (?)</p>

<p><a href="http://safarix.com/">SafariX</a> (Pearson) - multi-subject, textbook only service; student access to online equivalent of textbook for 50% of print cost. <a href="http://www.netg.com/">Thomson NETg</a> appears to be another player in the area...</p>

<p>XML.com (and other O'Reilly web properties) etc. can be searched over from SafariU.</p>

<p>Within SafariU, academics bundle content in projects. 5 steps in building project:</p>

<p>- gather material<br />
- organise material (drag and drop interface, estimated page count, estimated cost to student)<br />
- print options (cover customisation, use own logos, binding options)<br />
- review (e.g. generate inspection PDF copy)  - can at this point go back to step 2,2;<br />
- reorder/reorganise material, index and contents will then be regenerated interactively<br />
order (generates ISBN)</p>

<p>Projects may be public or private (private for own use/own student use), public can be shared.</p>

<p>Looking to experiment with offline viewing options - e.g. socially motivated context (shareable annotations, comments)</p>

<p>Can't modify content (rights), but can write your own bridges. Can also import third party material if you clear rights and make it private.</p>

<p>In print version, each extracted section is branded at start of section wiith original source.</p>

<p>SafariU native (non-uploaded) content internally stored as XML [so we could get XML output...?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a> interested in the SafafriU platform (not the content) so SafariU will be providing platform services for Autodesk...</p>

<p>[is there going to be an API?]</p>

<p>No e-commerce layer at the moment. But e.g. a trainer might have a private project, print copies of the book, and then resell them privately. [Hmmm, how does the copyright work there?]</p>

<p>Compilation is property of SafariU, but original content is retained by author. [So we wouldn't own the rights to any compilation we produced? Hmmm...]</p>

<p>User uploads of PDF only (to prevent users e.g. uploading powerpoint with animations etc.)</p>

<p>But - there will be links out to multimedia materials.</p>

<p>No repagination of uploaded material BUT repagination of the native (XML) SafariU content. (Some guidance to style provided.)</p>

<p>Generate dynamic table of contents and index; no bibliography generation(?).</p>

<p>Won't index uploaded PDFs (yet) or some of the old, originally uploaded Pearson content (which omitted index terms).</p>

<p>docbook format, <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">XML mind</a> editor used internally, future potential for contributor upload of XML as well as current PDF upload.</p>

<p>No limit on amount that can be taken from one book.<br />
Minimum print book order number 10<br />
min page count 100<br />
max page count 820</p>

<p>After one print run, and delivery of course, instructor can go back in and revise content, reprint etc [same book but different edition? would the book get a new ISBN that's viewable via xISBN for example?]</p>

<p>At tmoment, if original source material included in compilation were uploaded, the compiler does not get an alert, but this may be something for the future.</p>

<p>?What about errata? No notification/feed thru of errata to sites/collections where content is used - <em>yet</em>...</p>

<p><em>Online:</em> within a syllabus, content from up to 10 book titles.<br />
Able to see which students have logged in to the syllabus.</p>

<p>SafariU - just a content delivery mechanism - not a full LMS.</p>

<p>Students want an offline option - what that might be is being explored - e.g. options that support highlighting, annotation etc. Value added, not just PDF. </p>

<p>Untethered options (??), offline use is current priority.</p>

<p>SafariU environment can be customised (cf. Autodesk relationship), so O'Reilly could host an OU look and feel SafariU environment for the OU.</p>

<p>Exploring federated search options (but then there are likely to be copyright hassles with reusing third party material not contained in SafariU).<br />
 <br />
SafariU/books online cleared for international use.</p>

<p>??<a href="http://www.bookshare.org">bookshare.org</a> - they can get SafariU content. [?Bookshare? - hmm - "Bookshare.org dramatically increases the accessibility of books for people with visual or other print disabilities." Maybe something the OU should look at?]</p>

<p>O'Reilly likes bookshare.</p>

<p>Search underlying SafariU will be reused to search O'Reilly in general.</p>

<p>Possible to purchase rights to republish x copies of someone else's book, upload those into a private project and integrate them with SafariU materials.</p>

<p>SafariU is a self-service, interactive offering.</p>

<p>NH: OU way is not me as academic putting together a course; it's me as academic in a CT doing some things, but other stuff gets done by/control passes to other people.</p>

<p>Costs are scarey for OU (scaleable) use.</p>

<p>Potential for shared authentication between OU students authenticated into Moodle and across to SafariU (perhaps branded in OU way and provided as content page withing Moodle).</p>

<p>NH: How does OU business model change if we go down SafariU route (e.g. no need to purchase, warehouse and ship several thousand copies of a book over sevreal years).</p>

<p>[??expensive to recruit students - could federated search into our content help with recruitment and contribute to a reduction in this cost?]<br />
[Could we guesstimate numbers of books required, get them printed and have them shipped to Amazon's MK warehouse???;-) Set-up some sort of just-in-time/just-after-order print model with despatch to Amazon for fulfillment when enough orders are in? What's the POD turnaround time?]</p>

<p>?OU going to move towards sourcing more and more comtent from outside.<br />
O'Reilly moving away from pure publishing more into a service for educators.</p>

<p>Small amout of OU Business School is produced as print-on-demand already.</p>

<p>JC - 3 yr update cycle not sustaible.<br />
NH - you think it'll change in next 5 yrs...?</p>

<p>JC: shorter update cycle will happen<br />
NH: should - should happen...but it won't...not quickly...</p>

<p>O'Reilly talking to <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/solutions/itunes_u/">iTunesU</a> about potential collaboration. [Hmmm - something else to add to the <a href="./006073.html">corporate academic computer services</a> mix!]</p>

<p>OU library - 15 concurrent users to Safari books online via Proquest [see: <a href="./006589.html">ISBN Safari lookup Greasmonkey script</a>], which doesn't suit the OU in terms of cost/concurrent users etc. (important for a university with 180, 000 online students).</p>

<p>Interesting model would be for course to provide online material, and give student freedom to select and pay for the 'send me a printed copy' version.</p>

<p>OU has deal with <a href="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/cases/cases_home.jhtml">Harvard Business School</a> press to gain 1-click access to HBS materials. [Hmm - couldn't find a particular reference to that in the Library - maybe just 'yet another e-collection'?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oreillylearning.com/">Learning Lab</a> - online course product from O'Reilly???  Hands-on online environment for providing students access to virtual sys admin simulators etc. Covers programming languages, server admin, operating systems etc. [need to look at this...]</p>

<p>Current OU business model - e.g. course costings tool - just couldn't countenance using SafariU like methods.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://gilbane.com/case_studies/oreilly_case_study.html">O'Reilly SafariU case study</a></p>

<p>Safari Books online via Library still likely to be useful in addition to SafariU (though Safari online is v expensive and limited to 15(?) concurrent seats).</p>

<p>Two-dimensional view of publishing: free-premium content on one axis, atomised-packaged content on the other. Market would like free-atomised, textbooks traditionally premium-packaged.</p>

<p>However, textbook model does not necessarily reflect usage (e.g. read sections 2-3 of chapter one, and sections 4-7 of chapter 2 - most(!) people don't read textbooks like novels).</p>

<p>[A lot to think about here in terms of remodelling OU production and delivery processes...]</p>
