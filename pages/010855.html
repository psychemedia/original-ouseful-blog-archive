<h3 class="title">Open University Course Profiles Facebook App</h3>

<p>After a month or so of teasing, the first major push of our skunkworks <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=06d85b85540794e2fd02e9ef83206bf6">OU Course Profiles</a> Facebook app went live yesterday. Since mid-September, we've been quietly running an application on Facebook that allows OU students to declare the OU courses they've taken, are taking or intend to take. Until yesterday, the app provided a course badge panel on a user's profile page...</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/1640856721_ce898f1c06.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="278" width="486" /></p>

<p>... and announced courses added to their profile on their news feed...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2301/1641729824_7482870cd6.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="83" width="412" /></p>

<p>Courses are added to a profile using a course code. One of the motivations for the app was the observation that many students self-declare courses they have been involved with in the signature to their online conference postings. OU students often take just one or two courses per year over 7 month period, studying at a distance and often on top of the pressure of work and family commitments. Under such a regime, the course code often becomes unforgettable!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/1640854279_184a593719.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="330" width="500" /></p>

<p>The course title is pulled in from a database of course codes and titles. Whilst this data <em>can</em> be scraped from the OU courses and qualifications website (at least for currently presented courses), we managed to obtain <em>a</em> list of course codes from an internal OU database to drive the title auto-completion code from the start; more recently, an authoritative list of course codes and titles has been obtained.</p>

<p>Part of the philosophy of the development team (myself, <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=33">Stuart Brown</a> (comms) and Liam Green-Hughes  (AACS; thanks for all your development effort, Liam :-), with <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/10/first-ou-facebo.html">Martin Weller</a> riding shotgun and covering our backs) was that the application should not make use of privileged OU information; that is, we would only use information that is available on (scrapeable from!) the OU's public websites, or that is self-declared by application users.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of efficiency(!?;-), we decided we <em>would</em> exploit data such as course code and title tables if by doing so we could make an argument to the data holders that they really should publish a public API of the information, and that we could demonstrate a sensible use case for it.</p>

<p>That said, where data has been made available to us, we have reserved the right <em>not</em> use any data we are provided with until such a time as we can make use of it via a public API, even if this means we use lower quality data.</p>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>

<p>The new features released yesterday start to exploit various network related properties, as well as exploring integration with OU related services that are <a href="./010591.html">keyed using a course code</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/1640855627_c17be99e67.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="258" width="500" /></p>

<p>The <em>View Course Information</em> panel currently links through to the 'external'  OU courses and qualifications code for that course (where it exists). However, we are exploring ways in which we might link to the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/occam/courseinfo.asmx">OU's XCRI web service</a> (SOAP, rather than RESTful with a JSON output option, unfortunately...) as and when course level details are made available through it. </p>

<p>The <em>OpenLearn Units</em> panel links through to a page that lists any OpenLearn Units derived from that particular course and links through to the corresponding units on the OpenLearn site. (Although we are not using this service, the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=eBdDcNdm3BGw5cCHy6ky6g">OpenLearn Units Derived from an OU Course</a> Yahoo! Pipe could be used to source this data.)</p>

<p><br />

As the <a href="./010778.html">OpenLearn Units in Facebook</a> app demonstrates, a Grazr widget can be used to display any number of OpenLearn Units in Facebook by making use of the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/index.php">OpenLearn Unit RSS Feeds</a>. Embedding of OpenLearn unit feeds in this panel is being explored. </p>

<p>The <em>Friends on This Course</em> link provides a list of friends who have declared their association with - or interest in - the same course, subject to appropriate privacy settings. Privacy has been one of our ongoing concerns, about which I'll write more in a later post (along with some notes on the development process behind the app).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2067/1641730120_134dfa68e8.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="221" width="500" /></p>

<p>The <em>Course Comments</em> feature started out as a Facebook comment wall, although we have since instituted a custom built wall. Whilst this means we host the comments and are in a sense responsible for them, it does mean we can remove a comment if it is flagged to us as offensive or abusive by application users.</p>

<p>The <em>Find A Study Buddy</em> feature starts to leverage the <em>course code declaration network</em> that we are beginning to map out. When a users tries to find a Study Buddy for a course, other users who have declared the same course, and whose privacy settings allow an introduction to be made to the user looking for a Study Buddy, are listed. A message can then be sent via the application to the potential Study Buddy.</p>

<p>A ranking algorithm <em>is</em> used by the Study Buddy finder tool, although you'll have to wait for a later post to find out more about it;-)</p>

<p>A further social tool is the ability to <em>recommend</em> a course to a friend. As well as promoting the application, there are obvious potential marketing benefits to the OU here (it would be handy if the OU offered an affiliate scheme, so we could get a percentage if anyone signed up to a course as a result a Couse Profiles app recommendation?;-).</p>

<p><em>However</em>, our intention has <em>not</em> been to develop a marketing tool - as a skunkworks team, we have been more interested in exploring the potential for cross-unit, agile application development (working on the <a href="">outside, inside</a>!) and the possibility of leveraging both the Facebook social network, and our users' self-declared OU course codes network, as a way of building OU student communities.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are approximately 3,500 members of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/networks/?nk=16827259">Open University Network</a> on Facebook, and about 800 in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2212434521">Open University Group</a> (which is the group I believe Facebook users who cannot join the OU Network (no *.open.ac.uk email address, I guess?) but who do want to participate in a general OU community, align themselves with).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=06d85b85540794e2fd02e9ef83206bf6">OU Course Profiles</a> application has  - as of 19/10/07 - almost 300 users, growing at several(?!) a day. It will be interesting to see how the app propagates through these two communities over the coming weeks, and whether anyone finds it OUseful ;-)</p>

<p>PS You'll notice that we called the application "Course Profiles" rather than "Open University Course Profiles". That's because it scales... if you want to know more, mail me...</p>

<p>PPS as well as adding OU course codes to the app, you can also add OpenLearn unit codes. So if you're interested in a particular OpenLearn unit, add the course unit code to your profile and see who else is interested :-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/skunkworks" rel="tag">skunkworks</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
