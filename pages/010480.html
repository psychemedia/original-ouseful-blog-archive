<h3 class="title">OU Podcast Strategy</h3>

<p>I don't think we formally have one... maybe we should?</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=11429">Philosophy Podcast storms the download charts</a><br />
<blockquote>What do Chris Evans, Danny Baker, Clive James and The Prime Minister have in common?<br />
All have podcasts in the Top 20 downloads on Itunes but none is as popular as senior OU Philosophy Lecturer, Dr Nigel Warburton, reading from his book Philosophy: The Classics.<br />
Dr Warburton's readings are currently 14th in the Top 20 and have more downloads than The Best Bits of Chris Evans; Danny Baker's All Day Breakfast Show and even, Prime Minister's Questions!<br />
<a href="http://www.learnoutloud.com/Podcast-Directory/Philosophy/Ancient-and-Medieval-Philosophy/Philosophy-The-Classics-Podcast/23666">Philosophy: The Classics</a> [<a href="http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss">RSS</a>] is an introduction to 27 key works in the history of Philosophy beginning with Plato and Aristotle and including the work of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Locke.</p>

<p>The free downloads began in May and will continue until all 27 parts are available. ...</blockquote></p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&view=o&file=http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;view=o&amp;file=http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss"></script></div>

<p>I was also tipped off today about a talk about iTunes U that happened on campus that I couldn't make:<br />
<blockquote>One of the big questions the talk answered for many Open University staff is who has control of the content? It turns out that iTunes U is not a hosting service, it's a subscription model, i.e. it provides the RSS feed for your podcasts and acts as an advert for your university. This means that universities host their own content, and retain control of it - iTunes just provides a way for people to find and access it.</blockquote></p>

<p>Looks interesting - and maybe something we can get involved with?</p>

<p>The talk actually took place in KMi, a venue that often records seminars that take place there. For a full listing of their public seminars, check out <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/seminars/index.cfm">KMi Seminar Replays</a>.</p>

<p>PS It's probably also worth posting this link here (that should also have appeared in the OUseful.info feed via my delicious <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">feedthru</a> tag a few days ago): <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/blog/jklittle/podcastingateachingw/44653?time=1183709833">Podcasting: A Teaching with Technology White Paper | EDUCAUSE CONNECT</a>: <em>"exploration of educational podcasting in three realms: creation and distribution of lecture archives for review delivery of supplemental educational materials and content, assignments requiring students to produce and submit their own podcasts."</em></p>
