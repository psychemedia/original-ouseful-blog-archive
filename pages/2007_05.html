<!--
<p>So the Facebook Platform has got me looking around their site a bit more... and just now I found this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/feed_prefs.php">feed mixing desk</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5069664836976005874"><img style="border:0" src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RlsRTxo-UvI/AAAAAAAAACo/7zbSw5L00-A/s800/facebookNewsmastering.png" /></a></p>

<p>Just like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010341.html">Facebook Platform</a> encapsulates the idea of application embedding that inspired my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">String'n'Glue Learning Environment</a>, so this content mixing desk embodies something that's been on my wishlist for a long time...</p>

<p>Now I did think I'd written about this sort of thing before, on my original (now defunct) blog, <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com">Micro Info</a> - but apparently not (unless the search is broken...)</p>

<p>The closest I can find is this: <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/07/rss-feed-annotation-streams.html">RSS Feed annotation Streams</a> (as well as this OUseful post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html">Integrating Ad Hoc and Formal Communities</a>). The implication here were patches for mixing in additional content to augment a particular target feed (more recently I've come to think of this in the particular context of elaborating an OpenLearn RSS course unit with additional materials).</p>

<p>The original idea, however, was more general and based on the idea of a mixing desk - taking in different feeds, 'amplifying' them a certain amount, adding in effects (annotations) or filtering them further, and so on to produce a final output feed mix.</p>

<p>[Update: found some of my thoughts on this topic on a mailing list archive: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/backstage@lists.bbc.co.uk/msg00447.html">random thoughts on a feed mixing desk</a>]</p>

<p>Anyway - Facebook have an implementation of sorts of this sort of model. Time to go play...</p>

<h3 class="title">(Not Really About) Institutional Blogging - Codes of Conduct</h3>

In a week or two, I'm second fiddle to Martin Weller in a workshop on edu-blogging in the OU (see the OUseful Calendar for details). One of the things I guess will be covering is what is and what isn't...
<!--
<p>In a week or two, I'm second fiddle to Martin Weller in a workshop on edu-blogging in the OU (see the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful Calendar</a> for details). One of the things I guess will be covering is what is and what isn't appropriate content.</p>

<p>So here's something that's perhaps a little close to the bounds of good sense...</p>

<p>The OU prides itself on being a distance education institution. We will shortly be requiring all our students to have internet access. We know that many of our students are in full time employment. Server stats presumably tell - err - someone, when our students are logging in (as academics running online courses we aren't currently privy to server stats... make of that what you will...)</p>

<p>We have internationally registered students - who pay more, I think, because we don't receive HEFCE funding for them. Presumably, some of our international students are in different time zones to the UK.</p>

<p>We are open to students of all backgrounds - presumably including some who don't observe "Christian" holidays.</p>

<p>I would guess - though I don't know - that many of our students study early in the morning, during evenings, and at weekends (even a short, 10 point course has an expectation of a nominal 10 hours study per week). Maybe we have survey data on this? That is, data on daily and weekly study patterns over 24 hour and 7 day cycles?</p>

<p>The OU's original mission was to be "'Open as to people, open as to places, open as to methods and open as to ideas"; more recently has come the recognition that <em>time</em> is often a barrier to entry, and one that is often discussed in terms of presentation patterns and course workloads.</p>

<p>So what sort of helpdesk support, particularly computer helpdesk support, should we be offering as we move towards <em>requiring</em> our students to have internet access? 24/7 most of the time? 24/7 in the Tesco sense (i.e. 16/1, 24/4, 22/1, 6/1)? Or something rather less? Like <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/">this</a> maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5069402461718860514"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rloirho-UuI/AAAAAAAAACY/rG5bkGeSAMM/s800/OUhelpdesk.png" /></a></p>

<p>That is, 13.5/7, except Bank Holidays and Wednesdays...</p>

<p>If a significant proportion of our students are studying "out-of-hours", are they being fairly supported? Especially when you take into account that it's during the early hours computer systems do seem to go down, albeit often only temporarily...</p>

<p>(Hmm, now what prompted this post, do you think? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Facebook Platform or VLE - where would YOUR students prefer to be?</h3>

I'm not a heavy Facebook user (though I do have more Facebook (and LinkedIn) friends than MySpace friends) but maybe, maybe the Facebook Platform is going to provide stickiness (for me) through the applications I can now use within it?...
<!--
<p>I'm not a heavy Facebook user (though I do have more Facebook (and LinkedIn) friends than MySpace friends) but maybe, maybe the <em>Facebook Platform</em> is going to provide stickiness (for me) through the applications I can now use within it?</p>

<p>Finding apps is not as easy as it might be, but here are a couple that have caught my in a "Facebook as semi-formal <em>ad hoc</em> social learning environment".</p>

<p>Why <em>semi-formal</em>? Because the original Facebook model - connecting people who are students at the same institution - can presumably be leveraged to allow sharing <em>within</em> a particular institution. For example:<br />
<blockquote>The Scribd Facebook app is a way to share documents with your friends and your school. Just like Facebook profiles, documents are only visible at the school of the uploader, so you'll need to add the app to see the docs at your school.</blockquote><br />
...which is what makes it <em>social</em> too.</p>

<p>(And the <em>ad hoc</em>'ery? That comes from users being able to choose which apps they add to their profile... for some of my thoughts from way back when on "<em>ad hoc</em> learning environments", see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html">Integrating Ad Hoc and Formal Communities</a>)</p>

<p>In case you haven't come across it, Scribd is an online document sharing app. One of the things I like about it is the embedded document previewing it offers. In terms of how well it might work as an eportfolio (like the OU's <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/mystuff/">My Stuff</a>), Scribd offers storage, tagging and previewing features.</p>

<p>At the moment, I think Scribd uploads can only be public - which is <em>not</em> so good for a personal portfolio. However, the <a href="http://box.net">Box.net</a> online storage application has already got onto the Facebook platform, so that's a place to keep things privately I guess?</p>

<p>On its own site (?!) Box.net offers <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/boxnet-integrates-zoho/">Zoho integration</a> (discussed in passing here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009692.html">ePortfolios, Distributed Storage and Personal Repository Caches</a>), so it'll be interesting to see whether editing box documents exposed in your Facebook profile via Zoho will be possible... </p>

<p>I briefly commented in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010334.html">PLE as a Platform?</a> how integrating the <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho application suite</a> with Facebook would be really something. Zoho is already starting to embed some of its applications in others (I was using <a href="http://chat.zoho.com">Zoho Chat</a> in <a href="http://meeting.zoho.com">Zoho Meeting</a> last week - and then spotted that it will be possible to <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/announcements/announcing-zoho-meeting/">embed Zoho Meetings in a Zoho Presenter slide</a>.</p>

<p>[<em>Added</em>: with integrated tools and document sharing - Web O/S style - <em>as well as</em> the social linkages and permission structures/authentication offered by Facebook, I think the Facebook Platform is definitely worth watching. Institutions may not go for it (are they going for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">Google or Microsoft hosted solutions</a>, for example?) but their students might. And those students  - as graduates -  might stick with it <em>after</em> they complete their studies. Many HEIs are trying to bolster charitable donations by developing alumni networks (rather than lifelong learning networks/communities....?) Maybe the students will create their own?]</p>

<p>Social bookmarking can now be embedded in Facebook via <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2378401597">ma.gnolia</a> and calendaring using <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2359167966">30 boxes</a>.</p>

<p>And just as I envisioned <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">Stringle</a>-like environments offering embedded, "in-LE" editors, the Facebook Platform offers this approach too: as it does with the <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2258014869">Picnik online photo editor</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Now here's your starter for 10: what would a Blackboard or Moodle Facebook application look like? Does it even make sense to ask that question?</p>

<p>Or are environments like Blackboard and Moodle 'platforms' in their own right? Albeit not ones you would ever choose to spend your time in?!;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Just had a v quick play with <a href="http://popfly.ms">Popfly</a> and put together with a couple of blocks a youTube feed powered movie player. It's very simple - just wire a feed input block to a movie player block:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5068905022901605026"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RlheQxo-UqI/AAAAAAAAABk/s_45qNe6UoU/s800/popflyMovieDemo.png" /></a></p>

<p>When you inspect inside a block, context awareness allows the block to pick up on various things that are being piped into the block. In the case of the movie player block fed by a feed, it has picked up on all the feed item elements:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5068910000768701138"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rlhiyho-UtI/AAAAAAAAACI/ebPcb_f_7V8/s800/popflyVideoPlayer.png" /></a></p>

<p><s>If you visit this page on my actual blog site (not through a feed reader) you should see the movie player embedded below... (or maybe not, if it requires Silverlight? or if it doesn't work in public yet? or if I've done something wrong? [Works for me on IE7 but nothing else...])</s></p>

<p>[UPDATE: embedded popfly player removed for a bit  - it doesn't seem to be offering a good user experience just at the moment...]</p>

<p><!-- <iframe style='width:100%; height:100%;' src='http://www.popfly.ms/users/psychemedia/movieplayerdemo1.small' frameborder='no'></iframe> --></p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the player in preview form, just in case:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5068908321436488386"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RlhhQxo-UsI/AAAAAAAAAB8/O6UX40XfBhU/s800/popflyMovePreview.png" /></a></p>

<p>One other thing to note - when you want to share a mashup, several options are presented to you: <em>Embed It  |   Download as Gadget  |   Add to Windows Live Spaces</em>. The <em>Embed it</em> option provides HTML embed code as well as options to post it to Typepad or a blog that supports the MetaBlog API.</p>

<p>I did want to go and tinker with the feed, but Popfly has bugged out on me again and keeps hanging when I try to open the editor (Firefox on XP under Parallels).</p>

<p>Ho hum, early days....</p>

<h3 class="title">MicroSoft Popfly - Mashups for the Masses?</h3>

Okay - it's late, but I just spotted my invite to Microsoft's PopFly mashup tool in alpha... anyone else been playing? The interface suggests I have invites - but I don't? I assume blogging about the tool is ok, similarly...
<!--
<p>Okay - it's late, but I just spotted my invite to <a href="http://popfly.ms">Microsoft's PopFly</a> mashup tool in alpha... anyone else been playing?</p>

<p>The interface suggests I have invites - but I don't? I assume blogging about the tool is ok, similarly posting screenshots, but I'm going to hold off for a bit*, at least until I get to knock up a demo or two (things are a little unstable on my machine at the mo ;-)</p>

<p>In the meantime, here are a couple of youTube movies - a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkTdJAYb--M">3 minute video overview of Popfly</a> and a longer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-lYVLuxICk">twenty minute video demo of Popfly</a>:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hkTdJAYb--M"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hkTdJAYb--M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Suffice to say - the app is web based - though you do have to install the Silverlight beta. This seemed to install okay for Firefox on OS/X, Macbook Pro (and also onto XP Pro under Parallels - although Parallels doesn't offer 3D support so I don't know how many of the graphical UI blocks in Popfly will work?).</p>

<p>* Okay - maybe a couple of quick comments about the app: the idea is much like Pipes - wire together functional/process blocks and UI blocks, setting internal parameters where necessary. There are a few functional/computational blocks - like regular expressions - which means you can get your hands a little dirty if you want to/have to. Of the third party apps, Yahoo had quite a few tools in the 'official' blocks toolbar (which also has space for user created blocks) but of Google support, there was no sign... Hmmm... ;-) [It seems <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/119776240/">TechCrunch noticed this too</a>:-)]</p>

<p><br />
With the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010305.html">Scratch educational programming'n'animation tool</a> coming on to the scene last week, and the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009285.html">Yahoo Pipes web feed mashup tool</a> three months or so ago, there's now quite a spectrum of drag'n'drop, plug'n'play mashup editors out there in the wild...</p>

<p>... not to mention point'n'click screenscrapers like <a href="httpp://dappit.com">Dapper</a> and intuitive online movie editors like <a href="http://www.scenemaker.net/">Scenemaker</a> (which lets you tag clipped segments within youTube - and other online video sites - movies) and multimedia players like <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> for compiling multimedia assets in 'shows' and 'channels' that you can publish to your own site.</p>

<p>And here's one from the BBC that sneaked out quietly - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/findlistenlabel/index.shtml?programme=allinthemind20070501&ssorl=1179766447&ssoc=forgotten_password">find / listen / label - annotatable audio</a> (more info <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/findlistenlabel/help.html">here</a>):<br />
<blockquote>This is a tool for adding notes to radio programmes. You can split the programme into smaller sections, called snippets, and then add a Label.</p>

<p>Radio programmes can be split into snippets, like chapters. These may be associated with articles in the programme, like interviews, or just mark out interesting bits. The purpose of dividing the programmes like this is to make it easier for everyone to Find and Listen to specific parts of the programme.</blockquote></p>

<p>So there you go, a few more tools to add to the list that show how <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1984347,00.html">ICT education is getting left behind</a>...</p>

<p> ...and in case you haven't noticed, it's not just mutterings about ICT "education" that are getting louder - if you haven't already seen it, you could do a <em>lot</em> worse than taking 40 minutes out to listen to Sir Ken Robinson asking: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/66">Do schools kill creativity?</a>.</p>

<p>If you think the answer is "yes", then what are you gonna do about it?</p>

<p>Ok - so maybe a PLE is a platform...?</p>

<p>...and maybe a candidate platform is <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2415922130">Facebook</a> (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">developer info</a>)?</p>

<p>The main idea is that Facebook will bve exposing third party apps through the Facebook website. MySpace on steroids, MySpace done right, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Splashcast (one of the partners) has an <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com/splashcast-to-be-available-in-facebook">overview movie of the new Facebook platform</a>:</p>

<p>Read about it, err, everywhere at the moment: e.g. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_grows_up.php">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.rev2.org/2007/05/25/opinionanalysis-facebook-opens-up-launches-platform/">here</a> etc...</p>

<p>Now if they were also to integrate the <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho</a> suite of apps, that really would be something... it'd be almost as good as <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a>!?;-)</p>

<p>(I have a post in prep on Zoho at the moment. You want an integrated Web O/S - they're as close as anyone...)</p>

<!--
<p>Yesterday afternoon,  I gave a 'partial attention' workshop on <em>Social Bookmarking, sort of...</em> for the OU's <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2858">e-learning community</a> (eLC), a growing network of people from all over the OU with a particular interest in elearning related technologies.</p>

<p>The eLC, under the guidance of Chris Pegler, has events booked in every few weeks, often wrapped around an informal networking lunch, today being no exception. I got the afternoon session, following a great session in the morning by Adam Joinson on "privacy" (I'll try and post some notes on that talk in the next few days). Whilst there was some crossover between attendees of the two sessions, there were also a few differences too, which I took to be a sign that the events are providing a good balance in accommodating the wide variety of interests and information needs of the members of the community.</p>

<p>Anyway, a copy of my slides (such as they are) are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/social-bookmarking-sort-of">available on slideshare</a> and links to some of the sites I talked about are available on this H2O <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/144237"><em>Social Bookmarking - sort of...</em> playlist</a> :</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=54181&doc=social-bookmarking-sort-of-12110" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=54181&doc=social-bookmarking-sort-of-12110" /></object></p>

<p>I didn't get a chance to annotate the slides before uploading them, but the gist of the story I tried to tell was this...</p>

<p>When I started using delicious as a bookmarking tool, I used it largely for collecting links to web pages that I thought I might want to revisit at a later stage. As delicious grew, and my personal link collection grew, it became increasingly useful as a resource discovery tool. In particular, I'm thinking here of opportunities for discovery via pivot searching about <em>links, people and tags</em>.</p>

<p>Over time, I've started to think that social bookmarking as an approach generalises to the generation of <em>collections</em> of <em>resources</em> by <em>agents</em>. Resources are also labelled with meaningful <em>keys</em> - tags, labels, keywords, metadata - that can be used to index resources within the collection (as well as being used to key sub-collections).</p>

<p>Agents may be people, groups, or even algorithms - live resource collections (Okay - this is all a bit flaky still; particularly claiming a saved search - or filtered set of feeds - produces a collection in the sense that a person collecting a set of links and tagging them in the same way is. Or a collection of links in a course unit or H2O playlist is in some way similar to an evolving bookmark collection. But I'm working on it as a spectrum thing relating to the ways in which resource collections can be generated...) </p>

<p>Anyway, the next step in my personal use of social bookmarking tools was to start exploring ways of <em>using</em> subsets of the links I had collected by pulling them out of delicious using RSS feeds (because of course we all know by now that <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html"><em>we ignore RSS at OUr peril</em></a> ;-). Exemplar uses are <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=980">embedding live created lists of links in course materials</a> (login as guest), or using them to define <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007387.html">custom search engines such as delisearch</a> (or more recently, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">OpenLearn unit search hubs</a>).</p>

<p>RSS can also be used to pipe content more generally around the web, of course. Something I articulated to myself for the first time on Tuesday, whilst in conversation about how to promote RSS feed uptake, was that for sites I visit for new content, the feed icon brings a smile to my face because I know it means <em>I never need to visit the site again</em> - I can get the content sent where I want to read it :-)</p>

<p>(I also realised that even if you have the best RSS feed in the world, if the person you're trying to convince to use it does not subscribe to any other feeds, you are likely to do them a service by giving them the overhead of yet another place to go to consume content - feeds make sense when you aggregate lots of them in the same place, particuarly when they update over different periods.)</p>

<p>Dashboards like my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful Pageflakes dashboard</a> or Netvibes are particularly good surfaces for providing glanceable displays that cover a wide variety of independent information sources.</p>

<p>As well as creating lists to web page links, bookmarking tools can also be used to collate lists of richer resources - locations on google maps, video clips on youTube, for example, slideshows on slideshare.net or documents on scribd.com (I didn't really get scribd until I saw it after playing with the Open Repository Online - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010073.html">I know which way I'd rather consume documents now</a>!) (Check out the <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/144237">playlist</a> for the actual links.)</p>

<h3 class="title">More Timelines: oneTimeLine and the BBC British History Timeline</h3>

<p>Picking up on a post from last week about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010319.html">timeline</a> search displays, I just received a heads-up to a search intermediary - <a href="http://onetimeline.com/">OneTimeLine</a> - that "crawls the web and identifies events in time. When you type in a search, onetimeline matches up the words to events it's identified and displays them to you as a timeline."</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://onetimeline.com/timeline?query=english+civil+war+battle&date=&create+timeline=create+timeline">English Civil War battle</a> query:</p>

<p><img alt="onetimeline.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/onetimeline.png" width="677" height="387" border="0" /></p>

<p>The result item links click through to the original content, whether it's on wikipedia (it's not really surprising that a <em>lot</em> of the results are from there ;-) or an arbitrary website.</p>

<p>I'm not sure <em>where</em> onetimeline is pulling its results from, but it'd be quite neat if it was a custom search engine that users could inspect...</p>

<p>[Update: the onetimeline folks say: "We're using the Amazon Crawler over at <a href="http://awsp.alexa.com">http://awsp.alexa.com</a> from which we're indexing Wikipedia, BBC, YouTube and a custom timeline/history search."]</p>

<p>I'm reminded that one of the criticisms levelled against Google Scholar, for example, was that users can't tell what  journals/sources are included, unlike commercial academic search tools (or even Windows Live Academic), which <em>do</em> disclose the search domain.</p>

<p>As with the Google <em>view:timeline</em> switch, it would be really handy if the results were made available as a "temporal" RSS feed of some sort (or even better, a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html"><em>geotemporal RSS feed</em></a>), such as a feed that could be piped directly into a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">Simile timeline widget</a>.</p>

<p>Another timeline related tool I've discovered this week is an interactive <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/launch_tl_british.shtml">British History timeline</a> from the BBC.</p>

<p><img alt="bbcTimeline1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bbcTimeline1.png" width="771" height="488" border="0" /></p>

<p>The tool lets you explore significant events in British history either via the timeline, or by searching on dates or key events - <em>english civil war battles</em> gives the following, which suggests to me that the search engine could do with a little tuning...</p>

<p><img alt="bbcTimeline4.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bbcTimeline4.png" width="769" height="450" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another way of navigating the timeline is via predefined journeys:</p>

<p><img alt="bbcTimeline2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bbcTimeline2.png" width="715" height="284" border="0" /></p>

<p>Each defined journey contains a series of items, ordered naturally enough by date:</p>

<p><img alt="bbcTimeline3.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bbcTimeline3.png" width="782" height="390" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment, the timeline links to short, textual resources - I can't wait to see if they start incorporating audio and video resources too :-)</p>

<p>There is considerable opportunity, I think, for allowing students to create their own timelines (and maps) of key events in <em>whatever</em> subject they are studying, particularly if they can enrich the timeline with multimedia resources.</p>

<p>Maps and timelines provide useful scaffolding for organising information and helping students make sense of  - and a story out of - the things they are learning.</p>

<p>Let's just hope this tool doesn't go the way of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html">BBC Jam</a>...</p>

<p>PS here's yet another timeline display (via <a href="http://kiyo.wordpress.com/2007/05/19/google-experiments-timeline-and-map-view/">Kiyo's Blog</a>); a timeline search limiter from the <a href="http://search.ft.com/search?aje=false&queryText=British+Airways&resultsToReturn=10&drillDown=&worldPressPublicationFilter=&commentAndAnalysisFilter=&activeTab=ftNews&startDate=01%2F05%2F2004&endDate=31%2F07%2F2005&dse=true&dsz=2">FT</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="ft.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ft.png" width="620" height="442" border="0" /></p>

<p>I could see this sort of interface being handy for visually limiting search results in an academic journal or conference database, for example...</p>

<h3 class="title">Announcement Round Up</h3>

A quick post to round up a couple of announcements while I listen to the Pop Said (the best of the Darling Buds), which is as much fun to listen to now as it was almost 20 years ago (gulp)....
<!--
<p>A quick post to round up a couple of announcements while I listen to the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pop-Said-Darling-Buds/dp/B000GJ28B4/?tag=ouseful-21">Pop Said (the best of the Darling Buds)</a>, which is as much fun to listen to now as it was almost 20 years ago (gulp). </p>

<p>(If you haven't come across the Darling Buds here's a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0qHZROQWGRo">Darling Buds video clip on youTube</a>:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0qHZROQWGRo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0qHZROQWGRo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Okay - so here's the announcements: heads up again for the final call for papers for the OpenLearn Conference:<br />
<blockquote>The call for papers is open for the openlearn 2007 conference: researching open content in education. Deadline for submission by short papers (~1000words) is 31st May 2007. The conference will be held 30-31 October 2007 near The Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. There will be no charge for attendance with priority for registration given to those responding to the call for papers. Selected papers will be developed for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Interactive Media in Education.<br />
 <br />
The four main themes are: <br />
- agenda<br />
- Sustainability<br />
- User experience<br />
- Software and tools<br />
 <br />
Further information can be found at: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/">http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007</a>.</p>

<p>Forms for submission of papers can be found at <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/papers.php">http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/papers.php</a> and should be emailed to  <a href="mailto:openlearn-conference@open.ac.uk">openlearn-conference@open.ac.uk</a> by 31st May 2007.</blockquote></p>

<p>Second up - I'm doing a talk in the Library ICT Suite on Wednesday (almost as described on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful calendar</a>) on <em>Social Bookmarking</em> - sort of... as well as a quick overview of social bookmarking (in the vein of delicious et al., for anyone who is new to the idea of social bookmarking), I'll also be covering different ways of piping links into display spaces (web pages, Moodle environments, personal portals etc.) and looking at how to bookmark searches and multimedia items, among other things (which may be of interest if you have been to one of my previous SB workshops). The workshop will be run using a partial attention format, and networked computers will be available - though you can still bring a wireless laptop if you prefer.</p>

<p>I'm also getting to go on a couple of jollies, to the <a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/en_GB/details.html">Google API/Developers Day</a> in London on May 31st, and also the Yahoo/BBC Backstage hack day:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/en_GB/details.html"><img style="border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;" src="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/images/dev_green_small2.gif" /></a> <!-- Hack Day button 180px wide by 105px tall --><a href="http://www.hackday.org" style="border: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/ydn/hackday/hack_day_pattern_four.gif" alt="Hack Day: London, June 16/17 2007" width="180" height="105" style="border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><!-- Hack Day button ends --></p>

<p>Feel free to get in touch if you fancy meeting up at either of those (or for a pint after...)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the Darling Buds... I never did see them play live (I don't think... or the <a href-="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PRCGb6bBbY4">Voice of the Beehive</a>, come to that) though I did once manage to catch both <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_N8bGHtUGJU">Transvision Vamp</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AQFo2-xZiks">The Primitives</a> on the same bill at Warwick University; and took a hit promoting <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7MTq4I0hvq8">Daisy Chainsaw</a> a few years later...</p>

<p>Here's all of them in a <a href="">Splashcastmedia player</a>:</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/so/1/p/VGYF8270PG" wmode="transparent" width="400" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></p>

<p>...along with a <em>dodgy goth</em> show, too...</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Timeline and Map Search Results Views</h3>

<!--
<p>Just over a month ago, I posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html">Visualising Geo-temporal RSS Feeds</a>, in which I pondered on various mashup interfaces that could be used to display data contained in an RSS feed on a split view containing a timeline visualisation of the feed items, as well as a map view depicting the geo-location of each item, like this <a href="http://www.oe-files.de/gmaps/usgseq.html">Earthquake mashup</a> by Jörn Clausen which combines a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">Simile</a> timeline with <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google map</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5066041327687193202"><img alt="Google map and MIT Simile Timeline Mashup" src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rk4xvxo-UnI/AAAAAAAAAAw/kLPrMYC6M_E/s800/gmapsimilemashup.png" /></a></p>

<p>Something I didn't really explore in that post was the application of timelines and maps to search results (the only time-based search engine I know of so far is <a href="http://www.timesearch.info/timesearch/">TimeSearch</a>, but there may be others..for the geo view, I'm not talking about local search; I'm really considering fact based searches, which may already be possible via <a href="http://blog.pipes.yahoo.com/2007/05/02/pipes-adds-interactive-yahoo-maps-kml-support-and-more/">Yahoo pipes map mashups</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, Google's recent flurry of <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070516-121057.php">search related announcements</a> included a pointer to <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/">Google Experimental Search</a>, which is to Google's Search interface what <a href="http://labs.google.com">Google Labs</a> is to applications - that is, a listing of all the stuff Google are playing with in public, but is yet to make the Google front page.</p>

<p>A couple of the items on the <em>Experimental</em> page relate closely to geo-temporal visualisation, although as yet there is no split screen view.  However, what there is is this....</p>

<p>Consider a search on <em>english civil war battle</em>, for instance...</p>

<p>Search for <a href="http://www.google.com/views?q=english+civil+war+battle+view:timeline&vws=-127050&vwe=-125125&sa=N&ct=tlhist">english civil war battle</a> with the experimental <em>view:timeline</em> limit:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5066041344867062402"><img alt="Google Experimental Timeline Search results page" src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rk4xwxo-UoI/AAAAAAAAAA4/xozMwBZFxwI/s800/gxTimeline.png" /></a></p>

<p>Search for <a href="http://www.google.com/views?q=english+civil+war+battle+view:map&sa=N&ct=map">english civil war battle</a> with the experimental <em>view:map</em> limit:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5066041374931833490"><img alt="Google Experimental Maps Search results page" src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rk4xyho-UpI/AAAAAAAAABA/Sdly32P6S0U/s800/gxMap.png" /></a></p>

<p>When I get a chance, I'll do a split view with each of these results in a separate iframe, driven from the same original search query. [UPDATE: here it is - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010366.html">Google maps'n'timelines side-by-side</a>]</p>

<p>What would be handy, of course, would be an RSS version of these results, with the geo- and temporal data explicitly included somewhere. The aforementioned "geo-temporal feeds" post mentions a couple of (probably not very good) ideas for carrying the temporal data by usurping each item's posting time to carry the date the result applies to - such as the date of the first moon landing for a search on that term* - rather than the time the query was made, or the timestamp of the page returned as a result, for example.</p>

<p>I don't know if the Google SOAP interface is still working for those of us who have keys (I haven't checked for a bit), but if it does, I wonder if these search limits work with it?</p>

<p>*Hmm - I wonder if the <em>view:map</em> interface will end up displaying results using <a href="http://moon.google.com/">http://moon.google.com/</a> or <a href="http://google.com/mars">http://google.com/mars</a> if they are more relevant?! (It doesn't appear to at the moment - I checked ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Programming, Animation, and Lots and Lots of Fun</h3>

<!--
<p>The BBC Technology news site <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6647011.stm">just posted</a> about <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a new initiative from Mitch Resnick, who's moved on from Lego robotics to produce this animation programming environment.</p>

<p>(The site appears to be taking a hit right now - here's an older <a href="http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/llk/scratch/">Scratch project site</a> to be going on with.)</p>

<p>The tool uses an approach reminiscent of the Lego Mindstorms programming environment - users plug instruction blocks together create programme sequences.</p>

<p>What's really neat about scratch, though, is you can create lots of separate program fragments on a single canvas, and test them individually, then plug them together when you have created components you are happy with.</p>

<p>The programmes animate user selected characters (or photos) - as well as audio -  that appear in a split pane in real time; live editing of a programme is also possible.</p>

<p>I can't in to the site to grab the download just now, but the tutorial movies look great - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxDw-t3XWd0">here's one on youTube</a> - well worth taking a 5 minute coffee break over (watch it right through... demos first, howto second)... just get the way the 'instructions' are delivered :-)</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jxDw-t3XWd0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jxDw-t3XWd0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Interactivity is also supported, the implication being you can create your own simple games.</p>

<p>The only issue I have with it is that it's very obviously targeted at kids... although it'd be great for adult education too.</p>

<p>I can see now why Bloomsbury issue the Harry Potter books in adult and child editions, which presumably differ only in their artwork.</p>

<p>But that masks the real problem, though - why shouldn't adults learn from playing with interactive kids' toys  that just weren't around 40, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 year ago?</p>

<p>I "play" with Lego robots in a schools a lot. The computing power of the RCX brick, and the flexibility of the the 'robot prototyping system' - - hardware and software - would have placed the technology at the cutting edge of robotics research 30 years ago.</p>

<p>So why's it <em>kids' stuff</em> now?</p>

<p>PS I also blogged a similar piece about Scratch on the <a href="http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/2007/05/">open2.net Science & Technology blog</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Library Thing for Libraries. Oh, yes...</h3>

<!--
<p>The Open University is unlike almost every other academic library, in the same way that the OU campus is unlike most university campuses, in that it doesn't really physically cater to students, most of whom are distance learners.</p>

<p>Lending rights are largely restricted to academic members of staff, both at the OU 'central office' in Milton Keynes, as well as from the regions; and Associate Lecturers, who can make postal loans of books held in the library.</p>

<p>Local residents and students are also allowed access, I believe, but for most students, loans from the library are limited to electronic ones (and the OU has the potential to excel - meeting electronically the information needs of over 200, 000 students).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OUseful  Library Traveller</a> script uses the wide selection of online resources (ebooks and journals) to augment bookseller websites (such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble) with a panel than links directly through to an ebook version of the currently viewed book, where available. (Mail me if you want the latest version of the Firefox extension that delivers this service.)</p>

<p>Access to the OU Library OPAC (that is, the collection catalogue) is of little use to the majority of our students, although it is available to them; more useful are links to our students <em>local</em> academic library catalogues, a feature that's on my to do list for the Library Traveller.</p>

<p>Arguably, we could - maybe should - offer a <em>single</em> user-customisable library catalogue interface that presents a view on to the student's local academic library catalogue. Think something like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006140.html">Talis Silkworm Directory service</a> feeding an 'OU student local library catalogue' interface. </p>

<p>Alternatively, we could take a step back, and ask what it is we want from an academic book catalogue.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell (<em>not</em> being a librarian ;-), the OPAC does two main things, as far as the user is concerned.</p>

<p>Firstly, it's a custom search engine, socially constructed in part, over book and journal resources held by the library, with resources identified by academic staff and subject librarians over the past forty years.</p>

<p>Secondly, it tells me about the availability of a particular book held in the collection, within the OU library, or the availability of the publication online.</p>

<p>In minor third place, the system tells me about the current status of my loans - books I have out on loan, books I have reserved, books I'm overdue in returning.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, what services would I like the catalogue to offer me <em>as a student</em> (assuming for the moment we are limiting this to books (err, why??????;-)):</p>

<p>- effective search that works for mortals - i.e. not just based on some formal classiifcation by a cataloguer professional...;<br />
- books that are 'good hits' given my search terms/personal needs;<br />
- reading and recommendation lists for a particular course, perhaps?<br />
- availability of said books in a library <em>local to me</em>;<br />
- availability of books I have full electronic access to  - or that I can browse (e.g. via Google Books or Amazon Search Inside);<br />
- how appropriate the book is for a particular course, maybe? Think: Amazon-like reviews by other students, or course team members;<br />
- related books - 'students who studied this book on this course also studied...';<br />
- other editions of this book. Think: xISBN, or similar.<br />
- a place for me to add my own review of a book, maybe?<br />
- negotiated discounts with vendors should I want to buy several books on a list;<br />
- and maybe even <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009232.html">search over OU and OpenLearn materials</a>?</p>

<p>(Hmmm - it's quite interesting comparing that list with this one from a long time ago idling about My(Open)Library: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005306.html">OurLibrary</a>.)</p>

<p>How many of these services do we currently offer to our students, I wonder? (answers from the Library website redesign team  - who did an audit on the old/current site - in a comment to this post, please ;-)</p>

<p>Step in, <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">Library Thing</a>. For those of you who don't know about Library Thing, err, you should... ;-)  It's a bit like your own personal library catalogue, a bit like delicious for books.</p>

<p>It offers user tagging, reviews and related books; personal bookshelves/collections; and social "book club" like discussion groups.</p>

<p>And now, it's for libraries too: <a href="http://www.librarything.com/forlibraries/">Library Thing for Libraries</a>. Like <a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2007/05/danbury-ct-kicks-off-librarything-for.php">for the libraries in Danbury, Connecticut</a>, for example.</p>

<p>So what does it offer? basically, an augmentation of the default library catalogue view with the following Library Thing sourced data:<br />
<blockquote># Book recommendations. Show high-quality "recommended" or "similar" books.<br />
# Tag browsing. Give your patrons the power and flexibility of searching and browsing your books by tags.<br />
# User reviews and ratings. Add hundreds of thousands of high-quality user reviews. Give your patrons the ability to add their own.<br />
# FREE: Other editions and translations. Link related editions and translations of the same work.</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay, okay - so <em>at the moment</em> Library Thing is fiction focussed and not necessarily tuned to academic textbook collections.</p>

<p>But suspend your disbelief for a moment and suppose - just suppose - we give OUr students a <em>Library Thing, Academic</em> account? (is such a thing as <em>Library Thing, Academic</em>, likely, Tim?)</p>

<p>And suppose further we integrate this with a customisable OU student/UK academic library catalogue interface built on top of something like Silkworm, so students can see when a relevant book is held close to them (or via the OU Library, in electronic form)...?</p>

<p>... as well as supporting electronic resource collections built around <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003940.html">DOI</a>s (that is, cataloguing DOIs, as well as ISBNs) with one-click, pre-authenticated access to online electronic subscription copies.</p>

<p>Our students are distributed in nature - a problem for localised thinking in terms of the provision of library catalogue services, but one that is turned into an asset by approaches such as Library Thing...or <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/">Bookcrossing.com</a>.</p>

<p>We're already developing one informally titled service in the OU: <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/?p=168"><em>MyStuff</em></a> - the e-portfolio.</p>

<p>So how about another: <em>Library Things</em>?</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Personal Web History: My Panopticopedia</h3>

<!--
<p>The all-seeing Wikipedia defines a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"><em>panopticon</em></a> as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Panopticon is a type of prison building designed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The concept of the design is to allow an observer to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) prisoners without the prisoners being able to tell if they are being observed or not, thus conveying a "sentiment of an invisible omniscience".</blockquote> </p>

<p>Several weeks ago now, Google started rolling out their <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009922.html">personalised search</a> service, which for logged in users biases your Google search results listing according to your preferences.</p>

<p>At the time it was released, the service drew on users' search behaviour to tune personal results.</p>

<p>These preferences are built up over time as Google learns about you and your online behaviour <em>however it can</em>. Originally, personal results built upon the way users used Google, and the result links they clicked through. But now <em>all</em> your online behaviour can be taken into account if you so choose:<br />
<blockquote>Web History helps deliver more personalized search results based on what you've searched for on Google and which sites you've visited. </blockquote></p>

<p>Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/your-slice-of-web.html">Web History</a> service will collect - via the Google toolbar - a history of all the web pages you've visited so that you can easily search over the places you've been.</p>

<p>(And yes - the capitalisation of <em>W</em>eb <em>H</em>istory is correct according to Gogole.  Here's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=10470&hl=en">more info about Google Web History</a> if you're interested... or scared....)</p>

<p>The usefulness of this is undeniable - how many times have you tried to relocate a page you visited last week, or last month?</p>

<p>This itch is one that prompted Joshua Schacter to scratch when he set up the <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious social bookmarking service</a>; it's also one that's addressed directly within the Flock browser, which has an inbuilt page cache, index and search utility: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006428.html">Search Browser History in Flock</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know whether the Web History service also indexes PDF files I've downloaded, though, which I could see being a useful feature. (In fact, I'd be happier letting the Goog search over the PDFs I've read, rather than tracking the sites I've visited.)</p>

<p>If you're that way inclined, you can publish your live browsing history via an RSS feed, although Google's not the only service to offer this, as for example demonstrated in this recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/12/social-bookmarking-meets-big-brother-cluztr/">review of Cluztr on TechCrunch</a>, which describes a clickstream collecting and publishing service in which "[e]very site you visit is recorded and posted live to the Cluztr site in a social bookmarking style format, but without the need for active involvement".</p>

<p>Although most of us would be uncomfortable with publicising <em>everything</em> we're doing in the way that <a href="http://justin.tv">justin.tv</a> does, there does seem to be something in the air at the moment with respect to "look at what I'm doing" apps.</p>

<p>For example, I've started feeding the 'last played' info from last.fm into my IM status line, and could imagine <a href="http"://wakoopa.com">wakoopa</a> (reviewed <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/27/wakoopa-lastfm-for-desktop-applications/">here by Techcrunch</a> (again!)) being exploited in the same way to show what desktop application I'm currently using.</p>

<p>I guess the next thing we'll be seeing are Twitter application plugins that accept a highlight-right_click-twitter_this input and let you tweet seemlessly... (Just so you know, I haven't got into Twitter - and don't intend to...)</p>

<p>Whilst Web History can be used to track out behaviour via the Goolge toolbar <em>with our permission</em>, I suspect that Google  cookies can also be used in principle to track our web useage without our opt-in permission?</p>

<p>Google has multiple ways of getting these cookies onto our machines - via Google properties themselves, via web pages with Google Analytics installed, or Google Ads, or  - soon  - banner ads from the company presumably soon to be formerly known as DoubleClick: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2007/tc20070426_612648.htm">Google go for DoubleClick banners</a>. They're also gearing up to <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/05/google_unveils_tracking_t.html">track your eyeballs as you look at outdoor advertising</a>, maybe?!</p>

<p>Maybe this is something that will become a user preference - "add to my Web History if you see me"? Presumaby it'll happen in an anonymised fashion anyway. to improve the Google search and ad-serving experience?</p>

<p>Paranoid - me? Nah... because I know it won't get as bad as <a href="http://iandavis.com/blog/2007/04/per-user-pricing-at-amazon">punitive personal pricing</a> where I have to pay more for goods the "system" knows I want...</p>

<p>Anyway - back to the point in question, which was - err...?! ;-)</p>

<p>Ah yes - collecting everything we do on the web, storing everything we see...</p>

<p>Like the  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/MyLifeBits.aspx">MyLifeBits project</a> from Microsoft - which looks at how we might organise a personal lifetime data store. That is, a store of everything we have seen, or read, or visited: a personal panopticopedia (from wp again: <em>To the ancient Greeks, Paideia was "the process of educating man into his true form, the real and genuine human nature."</em>).</p>

<p>If we limit the lifetime data collection to things we have seen and learned from, maybe we'll all end up with our own Panopticopedia... (via Google personal search, of course...)</p>

<p>"This is your web life."</p>

<p>I haven't been in for a bit (can't stand the 10 minute download each time, hate the latency on the interface, etc etc) but I think I get an inkling of how we're going to use the space... ;-)</p>

<p>At least it gives you something to do in world (i.e. read)...</p>

<p>Hmmm... what really gets me about Second Life is that there are several people here in the OU being given time and resource to look at it...</p>

<p>...whereas there are dozens of <em>other</em> "web 2.0" tools, apps and approaches that could potentially offer real benefit to students now that <em>aren't</em> being looked at, that <em>aren't</em> being explored/played with, that <em>aren't</em> having resource allocated to their development.</p>

<!--
<p>"Glanceable Powerpoint" - what's that all about then?</p>

<p>Lorcan Dempsey posted a couple of days ago about <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001347.html"><em>glanceability</em></a> after seeing the phrase mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010272.html">Learnin' from Virgin</a>, my review of James Cridland's talk here a week or two ago.</p>

<p>Lorcan did a bit of digging and came up with an  <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-113.html">academic reference</a> that included this definition:<br />
<blockquote>Glanceability refers to how quickly and easily the visual design conveys information after the user is paying attention to the display.</blockquote></p>

<p>He then applied the concept to search results: "it seems to me that effective ranking, for example, supports glanceability, as folks will focus in on top results and may forego individually inspecting each member of a result set."</p>

<p>Yes :-)</p>

<p>It also struck me in half sleep this morning how the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010277.html">presentations I respond best to</a> when I'm in presentation blogging mode are slides that support glanceability - ideally slides with a mere handful of keywords that I can note down and use to scaffold my thoughts about, paraphrases of and quotes from, whatever the speaker is talking about.</p>

<p>The way Powerpoint is typically used - by academics at least - as a medium for pushing large amounts of text to the audience, whilst reading it out loud <em>as well</em>, was slated in a widely posted story last month reporting that people find it hard to process words that are being spoken at the same time they are being read.</p>

<p>The Presentation Zen blog posted a thoughtful response to this story - <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/04/is_it_finally_t.html">Is it finally time to ditch PowerPoint?</a> - which is probably worth reading if you've got an upcoming presentation to prepare...</p>

<p>John Sweller, the psychologist behind the news story (and author of this topic related <a href="http://www.iwm-kmrc.de/workshops/visualization/sweller.pdf">report</a>), was quoted in the original news report as follows:<br />
<blockquote>It is effective to speak to a diagram, because it presents information in a different form. But it is not effective to speak the same words that are written, because it is putting too much load on the mind and decreases your ability to understand what is being presented.</blockquote></p>

<p>The <em>Presentation Zen</em> take on this is evident via their "house style", which combines a small amount of text with a relevant image:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/images/2007/04/09/ppt_wastebin_2.jpg"  alt="presentation zen example slide" /></p>

<p>My own, evolving approach, is to try to build presentations around keywords or screenshots - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/slideshows">examples on SlideShare</a> - which is similar to the Presentation Zen model in this respect: the text (and imagery) supports <em>glanceability</em> and reinforces the point being made verbally by the speaker at that time.</p>

<p>How to use Powerpoint most effectively appears to be one of the memes of the moment in the blogosphere; here's a way in to that conversation: <a href="http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2007/05/powerpoint-more-questions.html">Tony Karrer: "PowerPoint - More Questions"</a>.</p>

<p>Take home message for me - for easier blogging, <em>make your Powerpoint presentations glanceable</em> ;-)</p>

<p>Earlier today - err, that is, yesterday - <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/10/uk-gov-youtube-better-than-yourminis-demo/">Marc</a> posted about a YourMinis page he put together on an <em>eGov</em> theme in a live demo to some eGov visitors to <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> last year.</p>

<p>Quite by chance, I'd been doodling with a <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a> page for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a> that pulls in live search info relating to the Open University, partly in response to a quick skim through a draft document reviewing environmental/horizon scanning across the OU by the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/planning/futures/">OU Futures Office</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOUsearch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOUsearch.png" width="1027" height="562" border="0" /></p>

<p>Although the Pageflakes page only took 20 mins or so to put together, I was intrigued as to how much time Marc put into preparing for his 5 minute 'create an eGov page in 5 mins' demo. I asked, and it turns out it took a couple of hours the day before, apparently, and then set up/browser priming time on the day...</p>

<p>If you've been thinking about doing a live demo to show off how quickly you can pull a page together from feeds and widgets, his post about the real story behind the time it takes to do a 5 minute demo is well worth reading: <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/11/5-minute-yourminis-demo-no-way/">5 minute YourMinis demo? No way!</a></p>

<p>It includes tricks such as bookmarking the resources you're likely to call on well in advance, having a run through on the environment you want to build, and priming your browser by preloading tabs with pages you're going to feed from. Good stuff.... Go <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/11/5-minute-yourminis-demo-no-way/">read it now</a>...</p>

<p>[Related to that is this post from a while back by Matt McAlister: <a href="http://www.mattmcalister.com/blog/2006/09/22/96/how-to-give-a-90-second-demo/">How to give a 90 second demo</a>.]</p>

<p>Returning to the OU scanning review for a moment, one of the comments I made was difficult it seems to be to get hold of search referral and site search data that may provide useful info to curriculum planners at faculty and departmental level. (It might also be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">fun to play with ;-)</a>.)</p>

<p>Reading Battelle just now, we could also make use of incoming referrals from Google to  provide "Maybe you're also interested in this?" search results: <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/003625.php">Cool New Search Referral Widget Live on Searchblog</a>.</p>

<p>This maybe does imply that out internal search engine is at least as good as Google... which I think is arguable. An email last week from a regular reader of this site - and member of the OU community - suggested that he used Google to search the OU domain rather than the OU search engine itself....</p>

<p>...and you know what, so do I: using the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Aopen.ac.uk">site:open.ac.uk</a> search limit...</p>

<p>(ooh.... this is interesting just doing a blank search on that: <a href="http://rfsmoodle.open.ac.uk/">Rocks From Space</a>, an informal, Moodled learning environment. Good stuff... not as friendly as it might be, of course, but a good initiative...)</p>

<!--
<p>To what extend could we - and/or should we - be encouraging students to use Web 2.0 tools, either off their own back, or via institutional systems?</p>

<p>Last week, I ran a 'partial attention format workshop' on "<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010277.html">Visioning Web 2.OU Personal Learning Environments</a>" at the OU's annual (if namechanging!) <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/CTSSconference/">Curriculum Teaching and Student Support (CTSS) Conference</a> (it used to feature the word <em>technology</em> in the conference title.... hmmm... but then, as one PVC observed during the week, we aren't necessarily as up to speed with elearning as we might be, either in terms of technology tracking and adoption, or elearning pedagogy...). Whilst I was preparing for it, I was in two minds whether to go down the 'here are results from elsewhere' route. Time ran out on me, though, so here are some of the notes I was cobbling together but didn't use, as well as a couple of related links I've come across in the last day or two...</p>

<p>The context for using these notes would have been something along the lines of getting a handle on the processes by which we might encourage students into the web 2.0 way of working (see this <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/Home/news/stories/2007/03/news_web2,-d-,0.aspx">JISC report on web 2.0 tools</a> for more info, [UPDATE: or this more recent report: <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/digital_repositories/web2-content-learning-and-teaching.pdf">Web 2.0 Content Sharing for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education</a>, also for JISC, by Tom Franklin and Mark van Harmelen]), as well as trying to forecast the timescale on which significant rates of adoption of these learning technologies might be anticipated in adult higher education.</p>

<p>A report published a couple of weeks ago by Forrester's <a href="http://forrester.typepad.com/charleneli/">Charlene Li</a> introduced the idea of <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,42057,00.html">Social Technographics</a>, an analytic technique that attempts to classify consumers according to their level of participation in "social computing behaviours" - that is, participation in ICT mediated (online?) social activity.</p>

<p><em>Social technographics</em> builds on the idea of <em>technographics</em>, another Forrester tool, which may be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Now-Never-Companies-Internet-Consumers/dp/1587990415">described as</a> "measur[ing] consumers' attitudes towards technology". </p>

<p>(The <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org">Pew/Internet: Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> also have a lot to say about this, as for example their recent <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_ICT_Typology.pdf">Typology of Information and Communication Technology Users Report</a> demonstrates. To see which type of user you are - <em>omnivore, connector, lacklustre veteran, productivity enhancer, mobile centric, connected but hassled, inexperienced experimenter, light but satisfied, indifferent, or off the net</em> - try out their <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/quiz/">quiz</a>.)</p>

<p>Li's research forms part of a book project  - <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2007/05/groundswell_the.html">Groundswell</a> ("a spontaneous movement of people connecting, using online tools, taking charge of their own experience, and getting what they need â information, support, ideas, products, and bargaining power â from each other") - which is being developed, in part, via the blog.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly caught my eye in the report is their "participation ladder", which can be used to identify the extent to which consumers participate in those activities:</p>

<p><img alt="forresterLadder.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/forresterLadder.png" width="455" height="419" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that users of different services or websites may be on different rungs of the ladder in terms of the extent to which they actively participate on those sites.</p>

<p>In certain respects, the ladder unpicks the <a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=5">creator/synthesizer/consumer pyramid</a>, which demonstrates in an even more powerful, diagrammatic, way the different levels of participation in terms of user population share across creators, synthesizers consumers:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.elatable.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/pyramid.gif" /></p>

<p>The formulation of a Web2.OU strategy could do worse than bearing in mind the Social Technographics data and the way users might climb the participation ladder (as well as moving through Pew Internet's classes of technology user).</p>

<p>In addition, a consideration of the time to (mass) adoption of particular technologies universally, as well as amongst different demographics, would be appropriate. Although the OU in its current incarnation tends to operate on near geological timescales (!), there is little point in making a push <em>now</em> to adopt technologies that will not be mature (in the sense of being stable enough to have become widely adopted) within the next 3 years. Although there <em>is</em> a point in tracking those technologies and softly developing ideas about how we might exploit them.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for being wary of too early adoption is that the rate of change of development in web technologies is ferocious at the moment, with large numbers of start-ups making land grabs for web based application areas: movie editing, photo editing, online office suites, content sharing, and so on.</p>

<p>The next 18 months at least are also likely to see the large media companies struggle to identify new business models as they experiment with content delivery models that do not involve Digital Rights Management (DRM). TVOIP/IPTV (internet TV) is just now becoming a reality, with download services already available from Channel 4 (4od) (and ITV anytime?), <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> is opening up invites all the time, the <a href="www.apple.com/appletv">Apple TV</a> is shipping (and is being <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/">hacked to bits</a>), the BBC iPlayer is approved and waiting release and the BBC Archive Download trial also about to start.</p>

<p>The flurry of free online applications that have appeared on the web over the last two years will start having to look for sustainable business models and carve out, if they can, a niche market in the face of online office suites. Google are already two thirds of the way there (with Google Docs and Google spreadsheets), and they have a presentation suite on the way. Zoho have a compelling range of integrated online office tools, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zimbra_comcast_plaxo_hp.php">Zimbra have just signed a deal with Comcast</a>. </p>

<p>What is lacking at the moment from many of these suites is offline working: but that may not be for long... (<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zimbra_desktop_offline_web_apps.php">Zimbra</a> is already there, for example...) In late 2007, the 'online only' nature of the web will be challenged further with the introduction of browser implemented offline storage in Firefox 3.0 and offline runners from Adobe and Microsoft(?). Indeed, the Dojo offline  toolkit <em>already</em> provides support for offline storage.</p>

<p>By tracking these technologies, we build up expertise in the technical details, and can maybe even contribute to their development (at a distance!) through early adopter demos and blog commentaries we have produced.</p>

<p>Lest we spread ourselves too thinly, of course, we need to focus on the technologies that our students are most likely ot use - or maybe already are using.</p>

<p>The most recent hook into this for me is "<a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/2007-horizon-report">The Horizon Report (2007 Edition)</a>", published by the New Media Consortium and Educause <a href="http://www.nmc.org/horizon"><em>Horizon Project</em></a>, which "charts the landscape of emerging technologies for teaching, learning and creative expression" </p>

<p>The structure of this report is based on a series of time-to-adoption technology forecasts over periods less than one year, two to three year and four to five year timescales. </p>

<p>(It would be interesting to see how these forecasts compare with the placement of corresponding technologies on the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475">Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle for 2006</a>, (and  - when it comes out later this year -  the 2007 report), as well as the Hype Cycles for <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=493556">elearning</a> and <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=493481">Higher Education</a>.)</p>

<p>Also relevant is the <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/survey-summary.pdf">Online Tool Use Survey</a> undertaken as part of the JISC funded <a href="http://spire.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">SPIRE project</a>. This project was "originally looking into the possibility of using peer-to-peer technologies in UK HE and FE for informal sharing but switched to a more Web 2.0 focus as it became clear that these types of services were already having an impact on the tertiary education sector", <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2007/03/16/some-real-data-on-web-20-use/ ">apparently</a>.  The report contains some interesting data on the current use of "Web 2.0" tools by students currently in UK Higher Education.</p>

<p>Martin blogged some of the headline results as he saw them <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/03/web_20_usage_at.html">in a post some time ago</a>. Here is one of the highlight charts for me:</p>

<p><img alt="oxfordWeb2ools.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oxfordWeb2ools.png" width="500" height="612" border="0" /></p>

<p>Okay - this post has gone on way too long, with more than enough reading for anyone who follows even a fraction of the links. It's an area I'll intend to keep returning to, though, hopefully in a little more depth and with a bit more critical analysis.</p>

<h3 class="title">Visioning Web 2.OU  (Partial Attention Workshop Format)</h3>

<p>Earlier this week I ran a workshop on "Visioning Web2.OU Personal Learning Environments" at the OU CTSS Conference. I'd lost the original abstract, so as far I was concerned I had a clean canvas to play with, subject the content bearing some relevance to the title.</p>

<p>I've tried running several interactive workshops before, both in seminar/meeting rooms (as for <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/insearchofthegoogLE/">In search of the googLE</a> (<- that page needs updating with <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/in-search-of-the-google/">slides via slideshare</a> and <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/106431">links via an H20 playlist</a>) and the OU Library IT Training Suite, which is where last week's workshop was held.</p>

<p>The first 'interactive' workshop I ever ran in the IT Training Suite event was on social bookmarking (before the days of slideshare - though I'll dig out the presentation and get it uploaded there <em>if</em> I can find the machine it's archived on!). That workshop was run almost along 'traditional' lines - I put links up and got people to follow along with what I was doing, with elements of free exploration - like free-for-all pivot searching on tags and users in delicious.</p>

<p>This time, I thought I'd try and run the workshop so that participants behaved as I behave in a 'normal' conference session (presentation, not workshop). That is, I sit there with my laptop, following links mentioned by the presenter, looking people who are mentioned up on Amazon (and maybe adding one or two of their books to my wishlist for a further look, post presentation), googling all sorts, and pre-blogging notes about the talk.</p>

<p>In other words, I only give the speaker my <em>partial attention</em> but I give the bits of topic that are relevant, meaningful and or useful to me my <em>whole</em> attention.</p>

<p>Disrespectful to the speaker? Maybe - but it means I come away with a personal resource package based on the presentation that I can always refer back to, develop further, post to the blog (= share with others who maybe couldn't attend the session), and so on.</p>

<p>One thing I've found about this approach is that I can't be doing with presentation slides full of text - which is one reason why I try not to fill my slides with lots of text heavy bullet points. Keywords and links do it for me when I'm following a presentation - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010272.html"><em>glanceability</em></a> is the key.</p>

<p>My audio attention (?) is pretty much dedicated to the speaker (as well as the audience - sighs, laughs, mutterings etc.;-), but my visual attention is split between the speaker's face/body language, glances at slides, and my laptop screen.</p>

<p>So - at the start of the workshop, I primed the audience along the lines of: "I'm going to ramble on a theme, pop up some links on screen, mention lots of others. Feel free to chase down those links that interest you and only listen to the bits of the talk that catch your attention, ask questions whenever you like and pick me up when your googling proves something I've said is wrong."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the slides correspondingly only capture a part of what was covered in the session (you can check them out here: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/visioning-web20u/1">"Visioning Web 2.OU Personal Learning Environments" on slideshare</a>):</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=44591&doc=visioning-web20u-8260" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=44591&doc=visioning-web20u-8260" /></object></p>

<p>I had intended to put together an H2O playlist, but that's still on the to do list. Certainly, I need to find a way of effectively link sharing during this sort of presentation, pushing links to people as I mention them (rather than providing them all up front) so they can follow them at the time; a link presenter, if you like (maybe like <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006041.html">deliShow</a>, although that requires the links to be queued up in the correct order in advance. Maybe a <em>link jockey</em> would be the answer (cf. a <a href="http://www.educause.edu/content.asp?page_id=666&ID=ELI7014&bhcp=1">Google jockey</a>) who pushes links out to the audience as the speaker mentions them - and maybe feeds links back to the presenter from the audience?</p>

<p>For the links that are mentioned in the presentation, I maybe need to flash them up in a large font for a few seconds before displaying the slide? Or have a slide design that prominently displays a relevant URL.</p>

<p>Did it work? <A href="http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2007/05/02/3949">Not for me to say</a>, though I did get this comment back:<br />
<blockquote>I thought it was good that you said people should feel free to explore things while you were talking. It meant that Chris and Martin felt free to type their notes into emails/blogs too [this is <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/05/my_daughters_mu.html">the post Martin was working on</a> - and yes, I do that in other people's presentations too...], rather than just sitting staring at you. I think that format worked for the people who were there. It might have been off-putting to beginners who wanted hand-holding, but I'm sure other participants would have supplied the hand-holding if asked. Basically, I found it easier to stay focussed than I would have if you'd either expected us to just listen & watch or only look stuff up when you told us to, which is the way people usually present in that room.</blockquote></p>

<p>Would I do a workshop in that way again? Almost definitely, though I'd try and make sure there was a link playlist available beforehand.</p>

<p>And did anyone Google me wrong? You betcha - I got picked up on my misquoting of William Gibson (first slide, proper...)</p>

<h3 class="title">Learnin' from Virgin</h3>

One of the keynotes at the OU''s recent CTSS conference was James Cridland, currently digital media director at Virgin Radio, but soon to be Head of Future Media and Technology, Audio and Music at the BBC. By far the slickest...
<!--
<p>One of the <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/05/01/full-house/">keynotes at the OU''s recent CTSS conference</a> was <a href="http://james.cridland.net/">James Cridland</a>, currently digital media director at <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/">Virgin Radio</a>, but soon to be Head of Future Media  and Technology, Audio and Music <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/05/03/to-the-bbc/">at the BBC</a>.</p>

<p>By far the slickest presentation delivered over the two day conference, <em>Control and Community in the Multi-Platform World</em> provided an overview of some of the ways in which Virgin Radio is using technology to deliver content and community to where it's audience wants it, whether that's via the radio, web or mobile device. In short, a presentation about "a strong brand, communicating".</p>

<p>Invoking Bob Garfield's <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=45561">Chaos</a> and <a href="http://adage.com/article.php?article_id=115712">Chaos 2.0</a> scenarios, (on the death of mass media and mass marketing), the point was well made that whilst mass media are reaching ever smaller audiences, the new media still do not tend to reach large audiences; a consequence of which is that there will be no media capable of meeting demands of the advertising and mass marketing sectors. Except <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12100B4BRLTE">via a Google advertising monopoly</a>, maybe!</p>

<p>(<a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a>, you gonna do a piece on the OU Chaos scenario: the death of long courses and the formal learning student?!)</p>

<p>With new media portable DAB radio players, such as the <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/computeractive/hardware/2166731/review-virgin-mobile-lobster">Virgin Mobile Lobster</a> (with its red button for interactive use, no less) or this <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/01/24/iriver-dab-slideshow/">iRiver DAB Slideshow player</a>, and web based players like the <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/listen">Virgin Media Player</a> (reviewed when it was in beta for a day before launch <a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2007/03/playing_with_the_virgin_radio.php">here</a>, and mentioned in passing by yours truly in the context of a post about a "<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009962.html">RadiOU</a>"), adding a visual component to radio broadcasts is now standard practice.</p>

<p>The Virgin Media player also combines the ability to play radio with the ability to play video. Will the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> do the same, I wonder? (I'm guessing at the URL - the 401 looks promising...)</p>

<p>However, whilst the visual component to radio is not just using limited to scrolling liveText displays, nor does it mean moving wholesale into television: the key is to support <em>glanceability</em>, a beautifully evocative word referring to the ability to look at a screen and capture the information you require <em>at a glance</em>.</p>

<p>Perfect for checking the name of the artist - or track - currently playing, for example, and providing visual cues that engage the audience just that little bit more, making the channel stickier and the listener (viewer?) just that little bit less likely to tune away.</p>

<p>(For a 2004 take on why the move to digital radio broadcast over the aether is so compelling compared to current FM analogue broadcasts, read the <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/pdf/dab_review.pdf ">BBC's submission to the DCMS Review of DAB Digital Radio</a>.)</p>

<p>Radio delivery is not just via the traditional 'radio' of course. Many mobile phones now offer multiple ways of accessing a radio station (via FM, DAB, the web, and so on), each with their own licensing requirements.</p>

<p>Two points James made about the Virgin Radio website particularly stood out for me: firstly, how abusive or unwanted contact from other users is handled on the social parts of the website - if an unwanted visitor is posting content on your site, you can simply choose to <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/vip/?action=editprofile&submode=ignore">ignore</a> them. The user can continue to post, and will think all is working fine, but <em>only they</em> will be able to see the (otherwise ignored) content they have posted. The cunning part comes when the same person is ignored by many users - then the system will set a global ignore flag. The user will continue to post, oblivious to the fact that only they can see their content. Beautiful :-) Although subject to abuse and community powered censorship, perhaps?</p>

<p>The comment that "peer production" and user-generated content are important <em>but</em> that brands should be guarantors of production quality and quality content was also well made. In the VIrgin Radio case, anything goes in community areas of the site, subject to self-regulation, whereas what goes on air is strictly controlled. This distinction is worth bearing in mind as the OU moves forward, I think.</p>

<p>Secondly was a comment I reused in a web 2.0 presentation yesterday:  the "Virgin [Radio] website is a website for the sort of people who like to listen to the music that is played on Virgin Radio."</p>

<p>Perfect :-)</p>

<p>Can the same be said of the OU site, I wonder, or the <a href="http://open2.net">open2.net</a> site, if we replace 'Virgin Radio listener' with 'OU student' (or 'OU alumnus')? </p>

<p>Hmmm.... although once again, the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair">OpenLearn comms team</a> are hinting at possible ways forward on this score: <a href="http://openlearn.ning.com">OpenLearn Community</a>. I'm <em>so glad</em> they have no developer resource, and have to make do with what they can find on the web... ;-)</p>

<p>Finally, issues surrounding the definition and collection of appropriate metrics was raised, both for subscription content in general, and audio content in general (how do you know if someone has listened to a track, for example? [Err - get everyone <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">scrobbling</a>, maybe?]</p>

<p>Tracking and analytics are something that just doesn't appear to be happening here in the OU yet, even for something as simple as tracking simple website user behaviour (or if it is, its not getting to the course teams). I couldn't tell you, for example, whether any student on any of the 5(?) presentations of the online T184 course has ever looked at one of the course web pages, let alone followed any of the external links  from them; or played any of the movies. (A <em>cunning plan</em> is in place to try and address this issue, though ;-)</p>

<p>Just in passing, and sort of related in a hint dropping sort of way in case James C reads this on his way to the Beeb, I'm hoping we'll get to play with the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11766ad2-f6b7-11db-9812-000b5df10621,_i_rssPage=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340.html">BBC iPlayer</a> sometime soon; (I'm also personally signed up to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6568163.stm">BBC Archive trial</a> - though I haven't been invited in yet, so maybe I didn't get a place... So much for having a strategic grass roots relationship between the OU, open2.net and the BBC new media developers!).</p>

<p>The OU Broadcast review is also trundling along (check out Martin Weller's CTSS presentation on the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mweller/the-ou-and-broadcast/1">OU Broadcast Review</a> for more info), so it'll be interesting to see where that leads over the next 18 months or so.</p>

<p>Each of the two OU Curriculum, Teaching and Student Support (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/CTSSconference/">CTSS</a>) Conference  days this week ended with plenary session, with panels made up from the great and the good in the OU hierarchy. Yesterday's panel session included <a href="http://memex.naughtons.org">John Naughton</a>, who dared to mention the 'word' RSS, to blank stares from many in the audience and most of the panel.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>In today's panel, an unpicked upon, throwaway comment  - in what I thought sounded like a mocking tone - about "John Naughton's RSS feeds, ha, ha" suggested to me RSS is something that some may have heard about, but have little understanding of.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>As a publishing medium, RSS offers two significant benefits to the OU and other e-learning providers. Firstly, it provides a mechanism by which users can <em>subscribe</em> to content delivered by the RSS feed and receive it at a time of their choosing. Secondly, it provides a medium for <em>syndicating</em> that content, allowing users to republish it (that is, view it) in a location of their choosing.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p><em>Subscription</em> is familiar idea in many areas of publishing. To see how subscription works with RSS feeds, <a href="http://www.blip.tv/file/205570?filename=Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.flv">watch this</a>. When you <em>subscribe</em> to a service, you enter into a <em>trusted relationship</em> with the service provider. Within the context of that relationship, you might expect to receive a certain type of content, maybe at a regular interval, maybe on demand, for the duration of subscription term. Ideally, you, as subscriber, should be able to terminate the subscription, without penalty, at any time. Control rests with you - the user. As we move away from a world dominated by broadcast media to one dominated by user-defined channels, RSS feeds will provide a key part of the 'hidden wiring' - or plumbing - for this new world.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Typically, RSS feeds allow users to subscribe to websites and receive content updates, via the  feed, as and when fresh content is posted. Another class of RSS feeds - <em>static RSS feeds</em>  - contain fixed content, such as the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">content of a course</a>, or chapters of a book. Users can subscribe to static feeds using services like <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, which deliver the feed items as bite sized "chunks" of content, once a day (or once a week, or twice a week, whatever), starting on the day you subscribe and continuing to deliver content according to a specified schedule until the last fixed item in the feed (such as the last chapter in the book, or the last section of the course unit) has been delivered. <em>The subscription to the feed continues until the user takes the positive action to unsubscribe</em>. For static feeds, the direct, user-initiated, trusted link to the user continues (unless they unsubscribe) even after all the content in the static feed has been delivered. This offers the opportunity to offer after-care, or cross-selling of other content feeds.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>One way of thinking about content delivered by RSS, compared to delivering via a website, is to consider the world of film. Visiting a website to consume content is like going to the cinema. You have to physically visit a multiplex, for example, and locate the screen that is showing the film you want to see. Subscribing to an RSS feed is like subscribing to a satellite TV channel. Your Skybox, or digibox, which you keep <em>at home</em>, of course, <em>aggregates</em> the channels you have subscribed to, each playing films on a particular theme. Each channel is like an RSS feed. You can choose which you subscribe to, and when. You can channel hop at your leisure. In the same way, users consume the RSS feeds they are subscribed to via a <em>single</em> application - either online (using a service such as <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> or <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>) or via a desktop client. Sky Movies sells convenience, <em>pushes</em> content to me. RSS is another <em>push</em> medium.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The second, key feature of RSS feeds are that they provide a way of <em>syndicating</em> content. Syndication is well known across the media, from print to radio. Many cartoonists, photographers, and local newspapers survive by syndicating their content - republishing it unchanged - to other outlets, typically for financial gain. RSS feeds allow publishers to <em>syndicate</em> their web content so that it can be republished on other websites or be delivered, in an appropriate format, to a wide variety of mobile devices.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Offering content for syndication via RSS feeds offers several benefits. Firstly, users can publish the content on a personal site they visit regularly, such as personal homepage or 'webtop', such as <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personal Pages</a>, <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>, or <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>. Secondly, the content may be published on other peoples' websites, providing more opportunities for users to come across it. Thirdly, content published on a third party website can provide <em>links back to the original publisher's site</em>, driving traffic onto their own web properties.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>As well as syndicating content, RSS feeds can be used as transport mechanism for moving collections of weblinks from an originating source, such as a database, and allowing them to be republished elsewhere. In the Open University, the OU Library is exploring the use of this technique as a way of surfacing links from their <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk">ROUTES</a> database and <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> collections within the <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/courses">Moodle VLE</a>. You can see many more examples of how RSS feeds can be used to pipe content into Moodle in this <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">demo Moodle course</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Valuable, topic related links, as well as media assets such as videos, interactive flash movies, images or audio files, can be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">mined</a> from within the body of a course unit and published via static RSS feeds, atomising the course into high value component parts; courses can also be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010236.html">bundled from RSS component feeds</a>. The media enhanced RSS feeds can then be published via online do-it-yourself media channels, such as <a href="http://spashcastmedia.com">SplashCast</a>. Like youTube, these services offer media players which may be embedded in third party or personal websites, or indeed elsewhere within the original publisher's own site, as taster, teaser, refresher or revision items.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Collections of weblinks mined from course materials can be passed via RSS feeds to users' browsers, where they can operate as course provided bookmarks. These static, link collection RSS feeds can also be used to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">limit web searches</a> via custom search engines so that the search is only made over the websites that are linked to from the original course.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Late last year, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7. Like many modern browsers, such as Firefox, Opera or Safari, IE 7 is geared up for RSS feeds. Not only is it capable of <em>RSS feed autodiscovery</em> - recognising when a web page publisher has declared within a web page that an RSS feed for that web page, or website, is available - it is also capable of subscribing to, and displaying, RSS feeds. Furthermore, installing IE7 on Windows XP systems also installs the  <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686418.aspx">Windows RSS (Common Feed List) Platform</a>, which is also an integral part of the Windows Vista operating system. This platform provides the subscription to RSS feeds at the level of the operating system, with the result that when one application (such as IE7) is used to subscribe to a feed, that feed is also made available to other applications via the platform. Subscribe once, reuse everywhere - at least as far as desktop applications go. The full implications of the common feed platform have barely been touched on yet. Under the most optimistic view, shipping the common feed platform with Vista could be as significant an event as when Windows first starting shipping with the Internet Explorer browser.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p><em>The future is bright. The future is orange.</em> <img alt="feed-icon-64x64.gif" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feed-icon-64x64.gif" width="64" height="64" border="0" /></p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Visit the website of any media outfit and it is likely that you will see the orange feed icon somewhere on the site. Web 2.0 blogger <a href="http://www.currybet.net/">Martin Belam</a> has recently published a series of blog posts analysing <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/currybet/~3/113551110/guardian.php">how "web 2.0" the websites are of the UK national daily newspapers</a>, a critique that features prominently the ability to subscribe to content via RSS web feeds. The BBC has published up a wide variety of RSS feeds, many of which are used in <em>web 2.0 mashups</em> developed by (public) members of the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/">BBC Backstage community</a>. The Guardian newspaper's <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/">Technology Guardian</a> website leads the way on innovative reporting in the print sector.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The BBC also uses RSS feeds  - as do thousands of others - to publish <em>podcasts</em>. Publishing an audio file on a website does not make it a podcast. A podcast is something you subscribe to. A podcast is an RSS feed with audio file enclosures.<br />
 <br />
<em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>In the same way that an audio file online is not a podcast, an online journal entry is not necessarily a <em>blog</em>. For me, a blog is something you can subscribe to. A blog is an RSS feed that contains predominantly text entries. Yes, the blog may have the public face of a website. But at its heart, it is nothing if you cannot subscribe to it. A blog is as nothing without a corresponding RSS feed. It is just another website.<br />
 <br />
<em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>To a certain extent, RSS is becoming a universal data transport mechanism. As well as transporting links and content, RSS feeds can also move data between websites. Many online calendars publish RSS feeds containing the dates of past, present and future events, and online calendars can in turn be used to <a href="http://30boxes.com/boxed">display the contents of an RSS feed in a calendar</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>GeoRSS feeds can transport geographical data directly into online maps, such as <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/03/kml-and-georss-support-added-to-google.html">Google Maps</a> or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/georss/index.html">Yahoo! maps</a>. The same RSS feed could even be used to pipe data into <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html">calendar and map displays at the same time</a>. </p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>RSS feeds can be merged, combined, sorted and filtered. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a> provides a graphical interface for building feed processing applications, lowering the barriers to entry to for developers keen to build RSS feed powered mashups - applications that use data from an online service (or data mixed together from several different online web services) and display it via other third party web services.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Many search engines make the results of a particular search available via an RSS feed that a user can subscribe to. Subscribing to the RSS feed of a persistent search (also known as a saved search) means that the user will be notified whenever the search engine discovers a new result for that search. Subscribing to the RSS feed essentially provides the user with an alerting service defined by the terms of the saved search.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to revolutionise the way we syndicate content throughout our internal publishing systems is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to expose and syndicate asset collections generated by mining our courses for those assets is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to revolutionise the way we make content available to our students so that they can study it <em>where they want it</em> and <em>when they want it</em> is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Laughing off RSS feeds as a technology that we don't understand is not an option.</p>

<p><strong>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</strong></p>

PS I've never written a manifesto before... which is what this is, I guess... sort of... in reverse, maybe... ;-)<br />
PPS Thanks to John Naughton for suggesting a few tweaks to an earlier version of this post.</p>
