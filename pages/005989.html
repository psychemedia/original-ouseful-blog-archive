<h3 class="title">Making the Most of Online Apps</h3>

<p>I've written before about the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/p3.shtml">application bundle</a> the OU gives out on CD to our students and how we might <a href="./005515.html">consider alternative approaches</a> to this in the form of delivering portable apps on a USB memory stick, or downloadable bundles like the Google Pack.</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript"><!--<br />
google_ad_client = "pub-4627481582813740";<br />
google_ad_width = 110;<br />
google_ad_height = 32;<br />

//--></script><br />

</script></p>

<p>There is a third way, of course, that is increasingly possible and that is to provide an online application wrapper that allows students to easily set up an online office environment for themselves.</p>

<p>For example, with <a href="http://www2.writely.com/info/WritelyOverflowFAQ.htm#Google">Google's purchase of Writely</a> presumably putting <a href="http://writely.com/">Writely</a> on a secure footing, we could now  point students to that as a possible application for them to use for writing documents.</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone is scouting the <a href="http://numsum.com/">Numsum</a> online spreadsheet, but that's another online application we could possibly be referring students to.</p>

<p>Ideally of course we'd be able to offer one click registration to these services (or the ones they select) for students who aren't already registered with them.</p>

<p>A section of the student's personal profile page on the OU system could also be used to allow them to enter their web apps login details so they could access these third party services from within the OU (or <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">OCI</a> learning environment. </p>

<p>Ideally we'd be able to offer common authenitication to allow students who have an current OU authentication ticket to access Writely, or Numsum etc. although I suspect the OU powers that be would be wary of exploring any such relationship with a web startup, or a web monster!</p>

<p>Web services would provide an alternative integration route, of course, even if it's only at the level of syndicating feeds (e.g. the <a href="http://www.writely.com/BasePage.aspx?action=rssInfo">Writely personal RSS feed</a> can be accessed via a <a href="http://writely.blogspot.com/2005/10/calling-all-rss-readers.html">secure <em>https</em> route</a>.)</p>

<p>That's still pretty neat, though. For example, I just added Writely to my <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> profile (read how <a href="http://blog.netvibes.com/?2005/10/20/10-web-20-integration-the-writely-module">here</a>), and was immediatley able to click through from Netvibes to any of my public Writely documents (and then edit them with another single click). The feed keeps users updated as to changes that may have been made by other authors collaborating on a document, which could be very handy in an OU context, with several students working at a distance on a common document as a part of a group exercise, for example. One for MyOpenLibrary, perhaps?</p>

<p>Netvibes has several other neat feed consuming ideas - for example GMail, and iCal calendar feeds. (Hmmm - calandars... perhaps we could add an online calendar to the mix, like <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> perhaps? I know calendaring is one of the VLE mini-projects - I really hope they make whatever solution they go for syndication friendly (both in and out)!)</p>

<p>And finally - you may have noticed that this is (sort of) an apps corollary to the <a href="./005963.html"><em>ad hoc</em> community doodle</a> I posted with last week. That's purely intentional...</p>
