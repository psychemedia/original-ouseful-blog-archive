<p>Okay, so I'm getting really lazy with the blog lately (been churning the words, just not in public:-( so here's a bit more cut and pasting, this time not even from me. Instead, it's from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/framework/bbc_service_licences/bbc_co_uk.html">BBC Trust report on <em>bbc.co.uk</em></a>, the Beeb's online presence.</p>

<p>I figure I can getaway with the huge quote becuase it's not likely that anyone's gonna click through and read the report, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the bits that are of particular relevance (maybe) to the OU, and the OU Broadcast strategy review (which I guess since it has finished now probably means no-one's interested in what's happening in broadcast any more? Even the intranet search no longer returns anything relevant when I search it for <em>broadcast review</em>, and when I search for the <em>phrase</em> "broadcast review" (i.e. in quotes, the intranet search gives me <em>no hits at all</em>...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534112441/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/2534112441_1b1ecdd378.jpg" alt="2008-05-29_2208" height="200" width="333" /></a></p>

<p>And what's the result?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534101817/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2534101817_b90c361c3a.jpg" alt="2008-05-29_2203" height="391" width="370" /></a></p>

<p>Hmm... I just repeated the search with <em>broadcast strategy review</em>, which got some hits, then repeated the <em>broadcast review</em> search - and it too gave some hits this time... crap ones, though... lots of docs titled <em>editable:doctitle</em> and <em>Working file</em>... WTF? Internal readers - here's the link: <a href="https://intranet-gw.open.ac.uk/bsr/index.php">http://intranet.open.ac.uk/bsr/index.php</a>. If you find the 'interactive' display as irritating as I do in navigational terms, here's the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/bsr/accessible/index.html">'accessible' version</a> which, errr, doesn't have links to the video clips, so you'll have to download and read the Word doc transcripts... sigh... Good job it's virtually impossible to find... and why, I wonder, isn't it public anyway...? Hmm - anyone fancy trying making an FOI request to get hold of the review 'report'?)</p>

<p>Anyway, where was I.... ah yes, the BBC Trust review... Here's what they said about education:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Education and learning</strong><br />
bbc.co.uk plays a vital role in contributing to this public purpose.</p>

<p>bbc.co.uk's Service Licence commits it to offering something of educational value to people of all ages through both formal and informal learning and a comprehensive service for children. Its output includes a broad range of formal and informal educational content for both children and adults.</p>

<p>The BBC has a strong formal learning portfolio online. The on-demand and personalisable characteristics of the internet make it more suited to the delivery of learning media than broadcast media in many ways and the BBC is increasingly focussing its formal learning activities online. For example, the BBC is progressively reducing the amount of schools programming broadcast on television and moving it online. </p>

<p>Another example is the BBC's long-running language teaching courses which are now delivered primarily online and are well-regarded by users.</p>

<p>Within the BBC Schools area, the BBC has two main formal education offers for children: Bitesize, which is heavily used by GSCE students in particular and Blast, which supports creative skills development. BBC Schools also provides teacher and parent support materials and other learning resources for children.</p>

<p>While we give some headline findings here, we will review the effectiveness of the BBC's formal learning offer for children and young people in more detail when we review BBC output for these audiences later this year.</p>

<p>The BBC's online formal learning areas have high volumes of use - BBC Schools is visited by an average of one million users each week, with GCSE Bitesize the mostpopular part of the offering. Bitesize's weekly usage ranges from around 399,000 in late 2007 to a peak of 650,000 in the GCSE revision period.</p>

<p>Adult learning sites, such as Skillswise and RaW, have lower overall volumes of usage but are used widely by adult education centres. These offerings are highly rated by their users, generating some very high Netpromoter scores.</p>

<p>Our public consultation demonstrated the value of these offerings to their users:</p>

<p>"bbc.co.uk is of great benefit to me personally and to my family. My children both make extensive use of it for research and revision and will increasingly do so as they prepare for GCSEs and beyond. It provides a source of reliable and trustworthy information targeted at the appropriate level for children and adults." BBC Trust public consultation</p>

<p>The Service Licence for bbc.co.uk needs to set out the BBC's online learning activities more clearly. While bbc.co.uk plays a key role in delivering this purpose, we have concluded that the current Service Licence for bbc.co.uk does not adequately reflect the scope of the BBC's formal and informal learning activities. We intend to amend the bbc.co.uk Service Licence following this review in order to set out more clearly the scope of BBC activities in this area.</p>

<p>The BBC's online content for children - via CBeebies and CBBC - is a clear strength. Both CBeebies and CBBC offer a blend of education and entertainment with content commissioned alongside television programming. CBeebies in particular receives very high quality and advocacy scores. Its average quality rating is above the average for bbc.co.uk and its Netpromoter score is over double the average. CBBC's quality and Netpromoter scores have been lower, particularly following a site relaunch which appears to have been received poorly by users</p>

<p>The BBC children's sites are amongst the most used in the UK - alongside fellow TV brands Nickelodeon and Disney. While the total level of usage has dropped slightly in the past year, our audience research and public consultation demonstrated how valued these offerings are by licence fee payers as sources of high quality, non-commercial, UK-originated content with clear educational goals. The BBC's online content for children will also be considered in more detail as part of our review of content and services for that audience later this year.</p>

<p>bbc.co.uk is highly valued by users as a resource for informal learning. This was one of the clearest findings from our public consultation and audience research.</p>

<p>"I looked up rubella on Google recently and it gave me all these links that were really scientific in their information and I just couldn't understand it. So then I went to the BBC website and it was really good, it had just the right amount of information and was easy to understand." Female aged 19-30, Belfast. Sparkler research</p>

<p>However, we believe its value could be increased even further by improved site navigation. Our audience research and public consultation suggest that many users are unaware of the full breadth of bbc.co.uk's offer, or that they have problems finding content they are looking for.</p>

<p>"There is loads of information on there that you just wouldn't know about, and you would end up using another site somewhere else to find it when the information is actually on the BBC site. So in that sense they are doing us a disservice by not telling us what is on the site." Male, aged 31-50, Belfast. Sparkler research</p>

<p>... We believe that the planned improvements to navigation and cross-site linking, as well as to the introduction of functions which allow search within audio and video content may greatly increase bbc.co.uk's contribution to the Education and learning purpose.</blockquote><br />
And also this on 'new media literacy':<br />
<blockquote>The promotion of digital media literacy is key to the Citizenship purpose. The BBC provides a number of offerings for basic digital media literacy on the well-established Webwise site. Webwise still has around 130,000 weekly users. In addition to this core offer, bbc.co.uk has also developed a number of projects targeting particular types of user: the WW2 People's War site was aimed at encouraging older adults to participate in an online project and CBBC's StaySafe provides advice on safe internet use to children.</p>

<p>BBC management's submission sets out four goals for bbc.co.uk in contributing to digital media literacy:</p>

<p>- to help people through digital media jargon<br />
- to encourage audiences to adopt emerging technologies and services encourage audiences to experiment creatively with digital media tools<br />
- and to provide advice to enable children to explore online content safely</p>

<p>As BBC management acknowledges, ongoing development of bbc.co.uk's media literacy offerings is vital in order to help the BBC contribute more fully to this public purpose. Encouraging more advanced forms of media literacy may be a suitable role for bbc.co.uk to adopt as internet penetration increases. MyCBBC, which aims to give children the skills and confidence they will need to interact online, is a good example of how the BBC's role in this area may evolve. As media literacy is a key priority within the BBC's Citizenship purpose, this should be a priority for bbc.co.uk. </p>

<p>The BBC's plans for improved support of BBC programmes and other online offerings will include more opportunities for audiences to form communities around BBC content. We expect that the future development of non-geographic communities should focus on areas where these can do most to contribute in a demonstrable way to the BBC's public purposes.</blockquote><br />
Something I'd completely forgotten about was that the BBC offers a web search facility (read more about it here: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/whysearch.shtml">BBC web search</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534991870/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/2534991870_c3482fc7a9.jpg" alt="BBC web search" height="43" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The trust queried whether the BBC should remain in this game at all...<br />
<blockquote>The BBC's role in providing web search has never been clear. bbc.co.uk has had a search engine for some time, but its role in competing against other web search providers has remained unclear amongst internet users. The Graf review commented on the BBC's search engine:</p>

<p>"Respondents in our audience research could not clearly identify the value of the BBC search engine. Many were content with commercial tools such as Google. On balance, however, I feel the BBC should retain its search engine. Given that search is becoming such a fundamental part of how the internet is used, it is worth keeping a publicly funded UK competitor in the market place."</p>

<p>Our audience research and public consultation demonstrated that internet users still do not understand why the BBC offers web search.</p>

<p>"I have used bbc.co.uk as my homepage for some years now, but I always look elsewhere for access to the wider web." BBC Trust Consultation</p>

<p>We note that the BBC's search engine has a very low level of usage: it has around 3 million monthly users, compared with 28 million for Google and around 6 million each for Yahoo!, MSN Windows and Ask. We note also that it has a much lower average number of pages opened by users, compared to other search engines: an average of 4.7 pages per user, compared with 104 for Google, 32 for Yahoo! and 17 for MSN.</p>

<p>We have considered the role of the BBC in the web search market. In the context of a web search market which has become increasingly commercially attractive, we have considered whether there is a role for a public service search engine. We asked for additional information on the BBC's intended role in web search from BBC management and understand that its future is being debated and that there are currently no plans to develop it.</p>

<p>We will expect BBC management to take a clear decision on the future of the BBC's web search following this review. It is not clear to us how provision of web search falls within the BBC's remit. While Graf concluded that there was a role for a publicly funded UK web search provider, we are not convinced that this is a role the BBC can or should play, except for possibly in limited and well defined areas such as children's. We are asking BBC management to report to us on plans for its web search engine following this review and we will then report publicly on any decisions taken. </blockquote><br />
Do you think Microsoft is scared that the BBC might continue to offer a web search product? ;-)</p>

<p>More generally, <em>should</em> their be a public service search engine? Bear in mind this comment, also from the Trust review:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Personalisation</strong> may allow users to opt-out of consuming news on topics which are important but perhaps not very interesting to them, e.g. politics or foreign affairs. One of the benefits of a linear news bulletin is that the agenda can be mixed to ensure that a range of topics is covered. Given the BBC's duty to promote citizenship and civil society amongst all audiences, we do not believe it would be acceptable for the development of optional or personalised news to lead to an unduly narrow range of consumption. As bbc.co.uk's customisation develops, we will monitor the trend in reach of those editorial areas...</blockquote>So what about the populace being fed a diet of (personally biased?) news and other web content from the Goog...? Just asking...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bbctrust" rel="tag">bbctrust</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20bbc.co.uk" rel="tag"> bbc.co.uk</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">The End of Stateless Search? Google's "Previous Query" Refinement</h3>

We all know that web search is stateless, right? That is, you enter a query in Google and you get a result back just for that query? That is to say, the result is determined solely by the search term(s)......
<!--
<p>We all know that web search is stateless, right? That is, you enter a query in Google and you get a result back <em>just for that query</em>? That is to say, the result is determined solely by the search term(s)...</p>

<p>Except it isn't - personlised search uses information the search engine knows about you to help tune the results... in Google's case, this could be from your previous search history, your web history, and I guess, <em>in principle</em>, the contents of your Reader subscription lists/attention profile, your Google docs, your email archive and your contacts list and so on...</p>

<p>(Okay, maybe you should regard personalised search as stateless too... and the personalisation stuff is just all part of the ranking magic...)</p>

<p>Anyway <em>this</em> moves things on: <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080410-095434.php">"Previous Query" Refinement Coming To Hit Google Results</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Last year, [Google started] changing the ads it displayed based on the previous query someone performed. For example, search for [spain] then do a new search for [travel], and you may notice how the ads will be targeted around Spanish travel (<a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=74246">more...</a>).

<p>Google's never given this feature a formal name, but ... internally the company calls it "Previous Query" ... . Learn the name well, because Previous Query refinement is now coming to unpaid or "organic" search results...</p>

<p>For example, if someone were to search for [spain] and then [travel] after that, BOTH the ads and the organic results will be altered to take the previous query into account. To some degree, it will be as if the second query was for [spain travel].</blockquote><br />
Note that is also different in kind to a 'search within results' query, whereby the second search term may be used to tunnel down into the results for the first search term.</p>

<p>I've commented before how personalisation weakens the notion of "Google ground truth" results (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009922.html">Personalised Search</a>), notwithstanding the fact that you might get different results from different Google servers from queries made around about the same time anyway, and this chips away at it even more?</p>

<p>For example, if you are using a public acces terminal,  where maybe one user replaces another in quick succession, could your results be 'contaminated' by the results of the previous person's searches?</p>

<p>And what are the consequences, if any, for those of us with at least a passing interest in teaching info skills?</p>

<p>In a thematically relate post from SEO by the SEA, "<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=1079">How Search Engines Can Learn From Looking at Sequences of Search Queries</a>", Bill Slawski introduces a new patent from Yahoo as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Whenever someone searches at a search engine, they not only get information in response to their search, but they also provide information to the search engine about the things they are searching for - information which the search engine might find useful in helping other searchers.</p>

<p>If that searcher performs another search related to their first search, then the search engine might create an association between the two search phrases that the searcher used, if the two phrases appear to be related. If they perform a series, or sequence, of searches on a concept, then the search engine might take advantage of that information.</p>

<p>If a lot of people perform that first search, and then the same second search, or that same search within a search session, then the search engine might decide that the phrases are semantically related to each other. Knowing that relationship exists between search queries might help the search engine help people find things on the web, and it might help provide better advertisements from the search engine.</p>

<p>A patent application from Yahoo explores how the search engine might find semantically related terms by looking at queries searched for by people in search sessions, and describes some of the processes behind how the search engine might determine that phrases may be related to each other.</blockquote>This approach is another step on from "previous query", essentially trying to find semantic relationships between consecutive search terms, and help the search engine 'intuit' what it is the searcher is trying to find (Jon Udell has written  - and spoken - several times about the tension between being able to search for something effectively, and not knowing the terms you need to use in order to be able to search for it effectively... e.g. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/04.html">Hunting the elusive search strategy</a> and <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/02/06/search-strategies-part-2/">Search strategies, part 2</a>.)</p>

<p>Increasingly, I've been noticing search engines offering "did you mean..." and "searches related to" prompts based on my search queries, which presumably is comparing my single word query with the most popular two word queries containing that word (maybe ranked to take into account personalisation features...?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534352210/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3138/2534352210_64d09fa969.jpg" alt="google search" height="255" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Hmmm, i-spy "search within results" too...;-)</p>

<p>Interesting times...   <div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20previous%20query" rel="tag"> previous query</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I've come to realise that a lot of my thinking is based around "lists" - as with the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014626.html">Education 2.0 Business Models</a> list of web 2.0 business models as vaguely applied to elearning... (Thinking of list brought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Fidelity-Nick-Hornby/dp/0140293469?tag=ouseful-21">High Fidelity </a>to mind for a minute, there... ;-)</p>

<p>Not quite as a sophisticated as using a periodic table like structures to identify gaps and make predictions about what might fill those gaps, I still find that a good enumerated list can sometimes help you identify 'missing bits' or clusters in the list items...</p>

<p>Anyway here's an oldie that I posted as a comment on Alan's blog some time ago (<a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2008/05/introducing-students-to-social.html">Introducing students to social bookmarking</a>), but which I figure may be of interest to some... It's a bit too short for gaps or clusters, but I was desperate to find something I could pull a quick and contrived post around...</p>

<p>So in true self-plagiaristic style...</p>

<p>Social Bookmarking - what is it good for (in an info skills development sense)?<br />
<ol><li>develop ability to find, tag and describe/short summarise resources;</li><br />
<li>develop ability to rate/identify RELEVANT, high quality resources for a particular task;</li><br />
<li>develop ability to use a social network to aid your own discovery process (follow/copy other peoples' bookmarks)</li></ol></p>

<p>If anyone out there is 'teaching' the use of social bookmarking as a PLE component in an HE setting, please add a comment back to Alan's post... it'd be good to see what other people's take is on how to communicate this stuff to our students...</p>

<p>(Hmm...if social bookmarking <em>is</em> so useful, how come the kids haven't got into it virally through their social discovery/cool stuff sharing networks anyway...? Maybe it's only us 'oldies' who need to bookmark things, write down lists and feel the need to rediscover (or ensure we will be able to rediscover) stuff at some future date? Maybe the kids are happy with transient, disposable resources, confident that they can always 'get another' or use Google to turn up something related, good enough or maybe even better..? Maybe this is  one of the side effects of open access to content and resources, compared to the gatekeepered fonts of knowledge that universities used(?!) to peddle access to?)</p>

<!--
<p>There's a <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/socialearn/">SocialLearn</a> steering group meeting next week, and as part of the document preparation for it <a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a> has tried to get us thinking about potential business models;-)</p>

<p>So to try and get myself in the zone for mulling such things over on a dog walk, here's a list of models off the top of my head...<br />
<br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Advertising models</span><br />
<ul><li>CPM (cost-per-thousand) ad impressions (banners, text ads, etc. etc)</li><li>PPC (pay-per-click ads - maybe via e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a>)</li><li>PPA (pay-per-action)</li></ul>Ads can be run as a 3rd party publisher (e.g. via Adsense) or by selling ad space/inventory (cf. sponsorship).</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sponsorship</span><br />
To my mind, this is ad-selling as much as anything... The difficult part is getting the ad-inventory/sponsorship.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Affiliate deals (cf. PPA)</span><br />
<ul><li>Books (e.g Amazon affiliates; cf. the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">OpenLearn_daily aStore</a>);</li><li>Jobs/recruitment (e.g. ?)</li><li>Courses (e.g. ?learndirect)<br />
</li></ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Upselling/subscription</span><br />
Offer a free basic service then upsell. Ideally, users should even be able to play with some of the apps without registering, but before they can do something really useful, they then need to register (i.e. a <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/pattern/LazyRegistration">lazy registration design pattern</a>).</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Transaction Fees (B2B)</span><br />
e.g. make businesses pay for bulk operations over the platform. If the platform acts as an aggregator, it may be that the platform also pays a commission feed to data orginators as a license condition of aggregating their data?</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pay-for-access/Licensing</span><br />
e.g. charge businesses who generate business on you platform; e.g. levy a license fee if they build apps that use your platform; metered access for users and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">generators</span> of traffic? (so e.g. if you build an app that makes frequent demands of my API, I'm gonna charge you for it (maybe Twitter should do this - let other people monetise at a B2C level and charge the app builders for client access to the API at metered or bulk B2B rates?)</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Data Vending &amp; Data Related Value Add Services</span><br />
<ul><li>data mining aggregated data and selling the insights?</li><li>recommendation services (e.g. people who X'd also Y'd);</li><li>selling on recommendations (lead generation, selling people's contact info in particular demographics etc)<br />
</li></ul><br />
Also related to business models, maybe, are the questions of 'recruitment and retention'. Word-of-mouth personal recommendations <span style="font-style: italic;">at scale</span> is probably one of the most effective ways of building users (as opposed to just traffic), so maybe we need some features that accommodate a 'viral growth sharing design pattern'? e.g. user invites for participating in collaborative activities (though again maybe with lazy registration?)</p>

<p>A quick google also turns up the following:</p>

<p> "<a href="http://www.technosight.com/web-20-business-models/">Web 2.0 Business models (Technosight)</a>" refers to the following diagram, which is maybe also worth mulling over:</p>

<!--
<p>How do you search? Do you ever to a quick <em>site:</em> limit on Google, or maybe knock out unwanted results with judicious use of "-"?</p>

<p>Some search limits seem to work pretty much everywhere, as this query on Google trends suggests:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=harry%2C++harry+-potter%2C+harry+potter&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0" title="refined searches on google trends"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/2516208072_2e5f870532.jpg" alt="harry potter" height="346" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(The "<em>-potter</em> element says "but not results containg the word 'potter'"...)</p>

<p>I used a similar technique to try to see if the Chrsitmas spikes for the word 'happy' were down to people doing "Happy Christmas" searches...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=happy+-+christmas%2C+happy" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/2516216692_0d3107021c.jpg" width="500" height="193" alt="happy trend"/></a></p>

<p>But it seems not...? As this query shows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=happy+-+christmas%2C+happy%2C+merry%2C+merry+-christmas&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2278/2515396493_29dc1544b2.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="happy merry christmas"/></a></p>

<p><em>Merry</em> <strong>is</strong> very much associated with the phrase "merry christmas"...<br />

In week 9, I lost the daily blogging plot, (in part because of the Making Connections conference), and the last couple of posts from that week were more like sparsely annotated link lists/reading lists than standalone 'educational posts'. I think I could probably bring them back with a couple of activity setting paragraphs, but that's maybe for another time... </p>

<p>One thing I've been trying to do in these summary posts is to reflect on how the 'uncourse blog experiment' might be used to inform lightweight (in production terms) future OU course development. So here are some thoughts on that...</p>

<p>(The following is taken from discussions around the <a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com">Visual Gadgets uncourse blog</a>, which I set up to draft materials for a chunk of course where I'm one of many people on the course team.)</p>

<blockquote>The following desirable characteristics may follow from the blog form:

<p>- the tone tends to be informal;<br />
- the delivery is episodic, with individual posts standing alone as well as part of an ongoing narrative;<br />
- blogs tend be focus on a general theme, as well accommodating series of special topic posts, or multi-part posts on a specific topic.</p>

<p>Blogged course strands might optionally run over several weeks as once or twice a week standalone 500-1000 word blog posts, so that students who can cope with context switching (studying more than one chunk/strand at once) can opt to do this chunk via a feed subscription. The rationale here is to explore different publishing models that support potentially innovative ways of embedding skills development in daily behaviour</p>

<p>For example, the Digital Worlds uncourse blog is quite a mix of posts if you look at it in (reverse) chronological order, though there are some narrative strands running through it. However, posts on a theme can be pulled together in a different display surface to show 'minicourses' by topic (that is, "chunks"), as the <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful/22031456">Digital Worlds Pageflakes reaggregation demo</a> shows.</p>

<p>These topics are things we might traditionally write and deliver as standalone, linear chunks. But they were actually produced and delivered via the blog in a parallel and piecemeal fashion. And for learners who may have a daily web ritual that includes visiting a content aggregation site - a Google personal page, or feed reader for example -  this mode of delivery (that  is a, a daily chunk, via an RSS feed)  may allow them to accommodate a 5-30 minute learning experience into that habit.</p>

<p>The use case of students allocating large blocks of time to OU study is one that we know works, and is likely to continue. I suspect many students also carry course materials around for opportunistic study, over a coffee break for example. But e.g. in my own life, I don't have my days structured in a way that would allow me to take 2 hours out for an OU course. Though if i have conveniently packaged learning materials to hand, I may have 2-3 x 5x20 minutes chunks of time free to study opportunistically.</p>

<p>What I want to explore is a limit case of such opportunistic study, where the learning materials are also packaged and delivered in a discrete, portable way, a bit like publishing content from breakout boxes in print materials on small 'prayer cards' for example, that the student can easily fit in a pocket and taken out and consume in a quick hit whenever the opportunity arises. What's interesting me at the moment are the ways we can structure, as well as disaggregate, some of our materials to support the publication of 'microchunks' and explore what the web versions might look like.</p>

<p>(There's a whole other opportunity too which is the design of conversational learning opportunities, where you try to find natural ways of introducing a learning activity into someone's daily online social activity on a social network. How do we package learning activities so that someone chatting to a friend and fellow student in myspace might then switch from chatting about coronation street to something course related? Or how do we package the learning activity so it drives them to their social network (we already do this with "post your thoughts on the conference" type instruction, so this would  just be the next step?)</blockquote><br />
I've put an abstract in to an internal computer aided learning research group conf relating to the Digital Worlds uncourse blog (I really should be submitting stuff <em>outside</em> though, shouldn't I...? hmm...) so if that comes off, maybe I'll be motivated to write some of this up properly...</p>

<p>PS I noticed today that the OU is hosting <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/relive08/index.shtml">Researching Learning in Virtual Environments - ReLIVE08</a> in November. I actually received the call from a colleague unassociated with the event who forwarded me the call from a JISCmail mailing list. Once again, it reminds me that there's nothing like sharing knowledge in the OU ;-) (i.e. knowledge sharing is BROKEN...  which makes me think - maybe like Will? - that we need to address deeper concerns than considering buying <a href="http://technocrapy.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/social-introduction-software/">stuff like this...</a>;-)<br />

<p>I was having a little play with Google Trends last night, trying to pick out terms that were relevant to education <em>at scale</em>, and not surprisingly, trend data suggests that there's probably a big online seasonal market for revision products...<br />
   <br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=aqa%2C+revision%2C+bitesize&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=GB&amp;geor=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/2507525123_d731bcb6a4.jpg" alt="2008-05-20_1002" height="207" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>As I was messing around, it struck me that a "trendspotting" shared content site might be quite interesting, where users can submit sets of terms (like <em>aqa, revision, bitesize</em>) that appear to be correlated on <a href="http://trends.google.com">Google Trends</a>? (<em>AQA</em> is  an examining body, and <em>bitesize</em> is a BBC revision site.)</p>

<p>The closest I found was something similar for blogs - <a href="http://www.trendpedia.com/">Trendpedia</a>, (and I've also posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010735.html">mood trends</a> before). Microsoft also have a trend forecast tool - <a href="http://adlab.msn.com/Forecast/Default.aspx">Search Volume Seasonality Forecast</a>.</p>

<p>You could even imagine using this as the basis for a game with a purpose, (that is, as a <a href="http://www.gwap.com/gwap/">gwap</a>;-). For example, I'm paired with another player, and we have to find sets of at least three separate words with a high trend correlation.</p>

<p>Higher "difficulty levels" of the game could require paired players to find terms that leads or lag each other in terms of trends. For example, in the UK, we get the following...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=turkey%2C+thanksgiving&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=GB&amp;geor=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0" title="Google trends: turkey, thanksgiving (in uk)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2507607081_0da2b4815f.jpg" alt="2008-05-20_1110" height="306" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Other levels might include finding terms with different sorts of periodicity.</p>

<p>(Note that this game would also work as a solo player game because the 'scoring' feedback comes from measuring the correlation of trend data, rather than agreement with other players; but maybe the discovery process would be aided by woring with someone else in a social way?)</p>

<p>Anyone out there interested in getting together to set some sort of "trend associations" site up?

<h3 class="title">delicious Tags'n'users Wheel</h3>

Over the weekend, I posted a couple of visualisation demos that displayed the history of a URL as it has been bookmarked on delicious (delicious URL History - Hyperbolic Tree Visualisation and More Hyperbolic Tree Visualisations - delicious URL History:...
<!--
<p>Over the weekend, I posted a couple of visualisation demos that displayed the history of a URL as it has been bookmarked on delicious (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014544.html">delicious URL History - Hyperbolic Tree Visualisation</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014547.html">More Hyperbolic Tree Visualisations - delicious URL History: Users by Tag</a>).</p>

<p>I also had a play with the <a href="http://www.unwieldy.net/moowheel/">Moowheel javacscript visualisation library</a> that plots connections between nodes on a wheel. Once again, I used the delicious URL history to plot the users who had bookmarked a particular URL, along with the tags they used:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/demo.php?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2498112816_d6915d716d.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="468" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This representation essentially 'flattens' the hierarchy displayed using the hyperbolic tree visualisations. Both tags and usernames are plotted on the wheel. Hovering over one of the labels (user or tag) highlights the connectsions from that label (so you can see who used what tags, or what tags a particular person used).</p>

<p>The demo can be found at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/demo.php?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/demo.php?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>The <em>url</em> argument identifies the URL whose delicious history you want to plot.</p>

<p>As with the hyperbolic tree visualisations, delicious history data is pulled into the page from delicious via a URL pipe. A small amount of javascript processing within the page puts it into the format required by the moowheel visualisation library.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/moowheel" rel="tag">moowheel</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualisation%20delicious" rel="tag">visualisation delicious</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">More Hyperbolic Tree Visualisations - delicious URL History: Users by Tag</h3>

<!--
<p>Building on from the previous post (<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014544.html">delicious URL History - Hyperbolic Tree Visualisation</a>), where I showed how the <a href="http://blog.thejit.org/?page_id=14">JavaScript Information Visualization Toolkit (JIT)</a> could be used to visualise the delicious history of a URL, showing each user who had bookmarked a particulalr URL, and then, for each user, the tags they had used, I've just put together a script that will do the opposite...</p>

<p>That is, it will show all the tags used to describe a particular URL, and for each of those tags, it will show the users who used them:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo2.php?mode=tag" title="delicious URL History - Hyperbolic Tree Visualisation"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/2497988230_b4bd08f432.jpg" alt="2008-05-16_2132" height="458" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the demo here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo2.php?mode=tag&amp;url=http://spotlight.reuters.com/">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo2.php?mode=tag&amp;url=http://spotlight.reuters.com/</a></p>

<p>You will notice two arguments, <em>url</em> and <em>mode</em>. The <em>url</em> should be set to the (escaped) URL you want the history of. The <em>mode</em> should be set to <em>user</em> (the default) or <em>tag</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>user</em> view plots the users who bookmarked the URL, and the tags they used. The <em>tag</em> view (as shown above) plots the tags used to describe the URL and the people who used them.</p>

<!--
<p>Over the last few weeks and months, several javascript visualisation libraries have arrived on the scene that allow you to create quite complex visualisations within the browser.</p>

<p>For almost as long as I can remember, I've been completely taken by computer visualisations, but almost completely unable to create them.... Something to do with not being able work out <em>how to do the drawing bit</em>, I guess?</p>

<p>Which is why I like the javascript visualisation libraries... as long as you can get your data into the right data structure, the libraries will display it for you. And being javascript - a lite scripting language that's easily abused and runs client side in the browser (no server or additioanl libraries required) - there's no time consuming recompilation of overcomplicated, syntactically nightmarish code;-) (although it must be said the browser can sometimes slow to a near halt;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, this morning I had a little tinker with the outstanding <a href="http://blog.thejit.org/?page_id=14">JavaScript Information Visualization Toolkit (JIT)</a>, a javascript library that plots treemaps, hyperbolic trees, radial graphs and "space trees".</p>

<p>Here's an example of my first attempt - a hyperbolic tree showing the people who have bookmarked a particular URL on delicious, and how they hae tagged it.</p>

<p><a href="%3Cbr/%3Ehttp://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo.php" title="JIT hyperbolic tree"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2196/2497057488_052be4426b.jpg" alt="(null)" height="418" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>If you want to try it out yourself, here it is: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo.php?url=http://www.york.ac.uk/">social life of a url (delicious, hyperbolic tree)</a>.</p>

<p>You can visualise any url using the scheme: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/jit/examples/hypertree-demo.php?url=http://www.york.ac.uk/</em> (though you should probably escape the URL).</p>

<p>If the browser warns you the script it taking a long time to continue, just tell it to continue ;-)</p>

<p>The data for the tree is pulled on from a Yahoo pipe (where else?!;-) which looks up the URL on delicious and returns the people who have bookmarked it and the tags they used (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014179.html">view delicous comments for a bookmarked URL pipe</a>). A tiny bit of client side handling puts the JSON output from the pipe into the data structure required by the JIT.</p>

<p>All in all, this took maybe 90 mins from scratch, 20 mins of which were spent wondering why this didn't work:<br />
<em>for (var j; j &lt; tags.length; j++) { ... }</em></p>

<p>[Ans: <em>j</em> needed initialising - <em>var j<strong>=0</strong></em> ]<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualisation" rel="tag">visualisation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/delcious" rel="tag">delcious</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Leaky Students and Semi-Permeable Course Boundaries - The Social Life of OU Course Codes</h3>

Over the last few weeks, I've started thinking about the "social life of URL's" and by extension the "social life of OU course codes". A couple of things have also prompted me to look again at social bookmarking (OUseful.info was...
<!--
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've started thinking about the "social life of URL's" and by extension the "social life of OU course codes". A couple of things have also prompted me to look again at social bookmarking (OUseful.info was heavily dominatd by social bookmarking issues in it's early days!) - one was an internal email, another was AlanC's <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2008/05/introducing-students-to-social.html">Introducing students to social bookmarking</a>.</p>

<p>Although many insitutional learnig environments are built on the assumption that we need a private place for students in the same cohort to work together out of the gaze of the public eye, the rise of social sharing sites means that course activity is starting to leak onto the public web...</p>

<p>In Facebook, there are now several dozen OU course related groups (set up by students themselves) and keyed by OU course code, as well as society groups, regional groups and so on:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2485344515/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/2485344515_3965302f64.jpg" alt="OU groups on facebook" height="437" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I've mentioned many times that OU course codes are incredibly valuable to us in a loosely coupled world (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010591.html">OU Course Codes - A Web 2.OU Crown Jewel</a>) so I've been wondering about the extent to which course codes are being used as tags for resources related to partciular courses. (Speaking personally, whenever I bookmark resources that I think may be relevant to a course I'm familiar with, I tag the resource with the appropriate course code).</p>

<p>And indeed, a quick look on delicious turned up several courses where students(?) have been bookmarking resources...</p>

<p>So it seemed to me, could we find some value from the public social networks building up around course codes, or add value back to the social sites with 'course hubs', using bookmarklets or browser extensions?</p>

<p>For example, if we have a course code, then we can maybe display a panel that links to a course description, or other course resources (such as derived OpenLearn resources)? In the simplest case, something like this maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/b201" title="B201 on delicious"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2045/2485353453_0049667f48.jpg" alt="course info on delicious" height="374" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>[The bookmarklet is still under dev - I'll post it when it's stable! The course title is pulled in via JSON from a Yahoo pipe that callers a Dapper screen scraper. The screenscraper scrapes the OU courses and quals page for the corresponding course. Unfortunately, the structural markup used on the courses and quals page is not as friendly as it might be, so for some courses the scraping doesn't manage to pull out e.g. the course description. I can see no good reason why we can't make courses and quals pages easily scrapeable, e.g. by defining a lite microformat to mark up course info, or expose course info by a lite, RESTful API (there is a prototype XCRI service, but it's too heavy...); so of course, we don't make that info readily available in that way... I;d suggest it on the Ideascale, but no-one would grok why I'd made the suggestion... which is maybe part of the problem...?]</p>

<p>Looking around some of the other courses on delicious, it's maybe not surprising that the the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography</a> course gets a double exposure on both delicious and flickr:</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/t189" title="T189 on delicious"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2485326047_fb0879ea62.jpg" alt="delicious course ad" height="317" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So how else can we use this info? One way might  be to build up social networks in public around course code tags, a bit like the way we built a course actions and study buddy finding service around course codes in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012552.html">Course Profiles Facebook application</a>.</p>

<p>But how ethical would it be to mine people's (peoples'?? anyone see the Apprentice episode with the special occasion cards?! ;-) affiliation with OU course codes - as hinted at by their use of course code tags on public, social content sharing websites, and display that emergent, discovered network via the use of bookmarklets or browser extensions?</p>

<p>In one of those 'in the air' type moments (if it's coffee time, check out <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell">Gladwell on "simultaneous discovery"</a>...), a just posted post by Alan again on <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2008/05/research-ethics-in-myspace-era.html">Research Ethics in the MySpace Era</a> raises some issues I <em>hadn't</em> thought about whilst tinkering with the above...<br />
<blockquote>A better analogy for research on social networking Web sites would be research on newspaper personal ads. Similar to a MySpace profile, the information is intended to be available to the public and invites correspondence. Both the personal ad and a MySpace profile may contain very personal and intimate information, but this information has been selected by its owner to be published in a public forum. The "subjects" might claim that they did not intend for the information to be used for research purposes, but they could not plausibly claim that the information was private.</blockquote></p>

<p>One to ponder, maybe?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/courseprofiles" rel="tag">courseprofiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20delicious" rel="tag"> delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/coursecode" rel="tag">coursecode</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20social%20life" rel="tag"> social life</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Will Woods called the  OU twittercrack problem yesterday (<a href="http://technocrapy.wordpress.com/2008/05/08/twitters-or-twits/">Twitters or Twits?</a>), so maybe it's worth just putting twitter into perspective for a minute...? ;-)</p>

<p>Here are the appropriate Alexa traffic rankings (I know, I know, the stats lie because everyone reaches twitter through a client rather than visiting the site itself... just like Second Life lapsed visitors do always convert to regular visitors over 3-5 year period (err..)):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/marvel.com?site0=twitter.com&amp;site1=facebook.com&amp;site2=myspace.com&amp;y=r&amp;z=3&amp;h=400&amp;w=700&amp;c=1&amp;u%5B%5D=twitter.com&amp;u%5B%5D=facebook.com&amp;u%5B%5D=myspace.com&amp;x=2008-05-09T11%3A49%3A51.000Z&amp;check=www.alexa.com&amp;signature=VpM32rxMCnXIzu3jH1euzr1ZB0E%3D&amp;range=3m&amp;size=Large" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3155/2477475505_51e14efb26.jpg" alt="Twitter in perspective - alexa" height="364" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>And on Google.... (okay - the stats lie again - everyone is really searching for twitterb*****ks rather than twitter...)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=twitter%2C+myspace%2C+facebook" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2326/2478289812_ce32dd3ef3.jpg" alt="2008-05-09_1247" height="335" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I guess there is something of interest though... Twitter is bigger than the OU - and getting more news...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=twitter%2C+open+university" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2335/2478297438_bb67c3b1e4.jpg" alt="twitter vs ou" height="273" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The Twitter/moodle crossing point is fast approaching too:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=twitter%2C+moodle" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2477488319_c90dcb4d94.jpg" alt="twitter and moodle" height="203" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>And so is the Twitter/Moodle crossing point with Second Life:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=twitter%2C+moodle%2C+second+life" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/2478302734_ed9cec3c2d.jpg" alt="twitter vs moodle vs second life" height="214" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Take from all of that what you will...</p>

<p>UPDATE: for a bit more local context, here are the UK trends:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=twitter%2C+moodle%2C+open+university%2C+second+life&ctab=0&geo=GB&geor=all&date=all&sort=0" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2381/2477744629_52570c7778.jpg" width="500" height="307" alt="twitter, moodle, OU, sl in UK"/></a></p>

<p>Notice how the search trend appears to lead the news trend early on?</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/287085980/summize_twitter_trends.php">What People Say When They Tweet</a> has the following from Summize for April/May 2008:<br />
<blockquote>Summize looked at about 4 million Twitter status update messages (tweets) collected from the public time line over a seven day period running from April 27 - May 3. We saw approximately 200,000 active users (users that sent at least one message) during that period, of which 60% tweeted in English. Japanese was the second most popular language on Twitter with about 9% of the tweets that we gathered.</p>

<p>Most strikingly, we found that a whopping 5% of all Twitter (in terms of tweets) is powered by the top 100 active accounts. [A chart suggests 50% of traffic is from top 10k users.] 66% of the users only tweet once per day.</blockquote></p>

<p>PS did I mention my Tweetspeech - twitter2speech - mashup made the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/may/08/socialnetworking.twitter">Technology Guardian  Twitter feature</a> yesterday? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Content Around the Edges - Linktracks (err, Trackmarks?! Linkmarks?!?!)</h3>

<p>If you're a reader of an blogs hosted on Wordpress.com, you may have noticed a section at the bottom of the post headed "Possibly related posts", as described in the possibly official posting <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/04/25/possibly-an-announcement/">Possibly an Announcement</a>.</p>

<blockquote>In a feature we're calling possibly related posts we'll now try to show posts related to yours a little section at the end. If we find any posts on your blog that are related, we'll put those at the very top and in bold. Next we'll show other posts from around WordPress.com, and finally we'll check if there's anything in the mainstream media.</blockquote>
I'm not sure how much I like this feature, yet, but I'll try and keep an eye on the recommendations and see how relevant or serendipitously useful they are...

<p>Something else you may notice if you visit a Wordpress.com block is a set of trackback links that show people who have linked to each post (trackback is spammable, so the publisher of the blog has similar controls over the trackbacks as they do over comments to a post).</p>

<p><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/2475578877_db649bc86d.jpg" alt="Content around the edges" height="247" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I've been mulling over trackbacks for a few days now, particulalry with respect to the <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com">Digital Worlds uncourse blog</a>. The reason? How best to accrete additional content around a post, once it has been published, to grow it as a resource over time.</p>

<p>In the limit, I see each post as potentially spawning it's own mini-uncourse, (think non-linear authoring and multi-course design, or similar?! ;-) so the question is- what's the best way to associate new content with the original post.</p>

<p>One way is to comment, another is to write a fresh post. But oftentimes, I come across a third party resource that I want to link back to one of my original courses, but that I don't want to add to the original post, or post as a comment.</p>

<p>One possible way around this is to associate a unique tag with each post, and embed within the post a widget that pulls in links I have bookmarked with that tag.</p>

<p>But I think another way is to make use of the trackback feature, and ping wordpress with a <em>faux trackback</em> if I ever come across a third party post or URL that I want to associate with my post.</p>

<p>So how would this work?</p>

<p>Using a service such as the <a href="http://www.reedmaniac.com/scripts/trackback_form.php">reedmaniac trackback ping form</a>, it's possible to send a trackback to one page with the URL of another. In this way, we can use trackback as a way of adding bookmarks to a post, in order to annotate it woth additional resources.</p>

<p>The trackback pinger actually requires at least 2 urls: one for the page you want the "trackback" (linkback? <em>trackmark</em>? <em>linkmark</em>? <em>linktrack</em>?) to appear on, the second for the page you want to "bookmark" (<em>linkmark</em>? <em>trackmark</em>? <em>linkback?</em>).</p>

<p>Actually acquiring these URLs at the same time is a bit tricky? One way would be to have a bookmarklet for each post you may want to link back to, and then use this bookmarklet when you are on a page you want to link back to the original page. But if there are more than one or two pages you want to link back to, this would become unwieldy.</p>

<p>A second approach would be to have a bookmarklet that pulls in a list of the posts on your blog, allowing you to select the relevant one, and trackmark the current page back to it.  The list could even be ranked according to a content analysis of the page being bookmarked.</p>

<p>The third approach is to have a bookmarklet that that captures the URL of the current page, and opens up a dialogue where you enter the URL of the other page. I suppose a paired bookmark approach would even be possible, whereby on bookmarklet captures the trackback URL for your original blog page, for example, and saves it using a web variable (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009187.html">statex - Global Variables for the Web</a>), and then a second bookmarklet is used on the page you want to bookmark/linkback, that also reads the web variable to populate the second URL field?</p>

<p>If I had a  spare hour or two, I'd try this... but I'm way behind with course writing again, so no playtime...</p>

<p>PS doublinks are very much on my mind at the mo - I got halfway to building a bookmarklet for the Cohere API that would let you bookmark a pair of URLs at the same time from a single page (associating a link on a page with the URL of the page the link was found on) before running into a missing (or undocumented) API call; that's all been fixed now, but I haven't had a chance to go back to the backend code that supported to bookmarklet:-(<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wordpress" rel="tag">wordpress</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/linkback" rel="tag">linkback</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20trackmark" rel="tag"> trackmark</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/linkmark" rel="tag">linkmark</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/linktrack" rel="tag">linktrack</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/sowhatshouldicallitthen" rel="tag">sowhatshouldicallitthen</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">An OpenLibrary API Handshake With Yahoo Pipes</h3>

<!--
<p>My blog reader this morning brought news of an <a href="http://www.openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api">API from OpenLibrary</a> (via <a href="http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/301/">Dave Pattern</a>), a strangely RESTful-JSON approach that expects json queries to be passed to the API via a URL... (not sure I've seen that before, such is the sheltered life I lead!?).</p>

<p>Like the <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/api/help.php">Cohere API</a>, the OpenLibrary API uses the idea of internal IDs as keys to access information about a particular resource... which is handy at times, but a pain at others...</p>

<p>For example, to look up the details of a book by ISBN, the following handshake is required: 1) ask the API for the ID of a book, given it's ISBN; 2) get the ID back; 3) lookup the book details using the ID.</p>

<p>So just to familiarise myself with the API, I thought a pipe was in order, and a quick half-hour hack later, here we are: a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=RPaoZPgc3RGpKzLWEpPZnA">Yahoo pipe that will look up the details of a book, using the OpenLibrary API, given the book's ISBN</a>. (Note that the pipe is, at the time of writing, not as complete as it could be - whilst it return return lots of data as JSON, the RSS is pretty bare. When I get a chance, I'll see about a pipe that will take the OpenLibrary JSON data and create some Dublin Core/RSS feed annotations using it.)</p>

<p>First up, build the URL to query the OpenLibrary API about the ID for a book with a given ISBN and fetch the JSON response from the API:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=RPaoZPgc3RGpKzLWEpPZnA" title="OpenLibrary API query builder"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2475334747_7a716a2898.jpg" alt="OpenLibrary API query builder" height="500" width="315" /></a></p>

<p>The next step is a fudge that hacks the API response to get the resource ID in a form we can make easy use of it. The Loop block actually takes the resource ID and gets the full record book data for it:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=RPaoZPgc3RGpKzLWEpPZnA" title="OpenLibrary - lookup details by ID"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3243/2475340171_8d23655ebf.jpg" alt="OpenLibrary - lookup details by ID" height="350" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the detail of the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=lkiZYfgc3RGcKoKNnkartA">OpenLibrary record lookup pipe</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=lkiZYfgc3RGcKoKNnkartA" title="OpenLibrary book detail lookuop query builder"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2043/2476164938_163366af93.jpg" alt="OpenLibrary book detail lookuop query builder" height="269" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(At the current time, this pipe only emits JSON, not any vanilla RSS.)</p>

<p>I then start to tidy up the data that is returned from the book record lookup pipe to create an RSS feed (this bit is far from complete!):</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=RPaoZPgc3RGpKzLWEpPZnA" title="OpenLibrary - make RSS"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2476167516_68ed4ca5c8.jpg" alt="OpenLibrary - make RSS" height="169" width="439" /></a></p>

<p>So there we have it - a bit of nested pipework that makes a couple of calls to the OpenLibrary API - the first to get an internal OpenLibrary ID for a given ISBN, the second to look up the details of the corresponding&nbsp; book using the OpenLibrary ID.</p>

<p>All told, I reckon 40 mins plus 20 mins for this blog post...<br />

<h3 class="title">I think you may be interested in this...?</h3>

<!--
<p>This post - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/05/were_playing_your_song_persona.shtml" id="open_article.61642093.52" target="_blank">We're Playing Your Song: Personalised Track Notifications over XMPP</a> just caught my on on the BBC Radio labs blog: "Just a little XMPP toy: send the message <i>lastfm yourlastfmusername</i> to radio1@hug.hellomatty.com and we'll ping you when one of our music stations is playing a tune by an artist you like to listen to. Fun, huh?"  </p>

<p>It goes on: "Behind the scenes I'm pulling your last.fm profile via <a href="http://tastebroker.org/">tastebroker.org</a> which wrangles it into APML. This means I'm storing your preferences in a way that should work as well for speech shows as it does for music. So I could use tastebroker's view of your del.icio.us feed to let you know when Radio 4 is broadcasting something you might be interested in. But that's for another time..."</p>

<p>A quick visit to tastebroker reveals that it can prduce APML from last.fm, Pandora and delicious... the delicious generated APML from my delicious account is a weighted list of tags I have used, as far as I can tell...</p>

<p>Anyway, some time ago Martin was "imagin[ing] what would education (or even just a course) be like if it was built around something like Last.fm, would it be a Last.uni?". Maybe this is another step along the road?</p>

<p>Just by the by, I wonder - is there a simple hack to use a transformed APML file as a  generator for Google <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html#5">custom search engine definition file</a>, or maybe a beter question is, what's the best way of using an APML file to seed a Google CSE?</p>

<p>This is typical of the sort of thing you find in a Google CSE definition file:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html#5" title="custom search engine refinements"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2473370410_b4f4925177.jpg" alt="Google CSE refinements" height="251" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>And here's a snippet of APML based on my delicious habit:</p>

<p><a href="http://tastebroker.org/" title="My delicious APML (fragment)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/2473374006_fe1146d4ce.jpg" alt="My delicious APML (fragment)" height="84" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The transformation from one to the other is trivial at a technical level, and there are maybe some appropriate mappings too... For example, APML concept keys could map on to labels, and concept values onto boost weights?</p>

<p>In fact, I think the labels would need to be defined as BOOST terms in a the &lt;BackgroundLabels&gt; part of the CSE definition...</p>

<p>Aaarghhhh, I really need to get back into CSEs - they are seriously powerful, (especially now I think I 've twigged how to nest them...!;-) I'm sure we could build some really crazy course and degree based custom search engines, with a little bit of thought!</p>

<p>Also, how about this - building an APML representation of e.g. each OpenLearn unit and using it: a) to help discover related content; and b) exposing the APML as metadata to feed into recommendation services that start to use APML?</p>

<p>Enough... I've course writing to do...</p>

<!--
<p>I've been thinking about the social life of URLs today, and in particular about people commenting on Twitter about URLs, so that I can add these comments into the mix along with delicious comments and blogs comments about a URL (see for example the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/deliurl">deliURL pipe - http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/deliurl</a>). There are a couple of sites that appear to be indexing URLs that appear on Twitter (<a href="http://twitterbuzz.com/%20">TwitterBuzz</a> and <a href="http://twitturly.com">Twitturly</a>), but neither of them offer an API (yet?!)... so here's a piped API for <a href="http://twitturly.com">Twitturly</a> that will take a URL, and give a feed back of people who've posted a tweet containing that URL.</p>

<p>First we need to build the URL for the Titturly comments pages for a particular URL. To do this, we call on the MD5 hashing service that I've used before (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014179.html">Pivotal Moments... (pivotwitter?!)</a>) to encode the URL, then construct the twitturly URL in the regular expression block:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twitturly" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2135/2470880224_22b1408122.jpg" alt="twitturly url builder" height="220" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>We then need to pass this URL to anotehr pipe that will scrape the twitturly comments page and generate a feed of the comments:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twitturly" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2470881416_4e1a272caf.jpg" alt="twitturly get feed" height="156" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=SAc02kMb3RGidDFU1vC6Jw">Twitturly RSS</a> pipe that scrapes the Twitturly page for an encoded URL and produces and RSS feed for it:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=SAc02kMb3RGidDFU1vC6Jw" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2470875216_8a5e8d62e9.jpg" alt="Twitturly rss" height="328" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the full pipe at <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twitturly">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twitturly</a> - just give it a URL and it will pull back any twittered comments about that URL from Twitturly...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitturly" rel="tag">twitturly</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Just for reference, here's a link through to the presentation I gave (wearing on-brand attire (thanks, Pete....err...?!) on the OU Facebook apps to the OU Making Connections conference - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/facebook-apps/">Two UnauthOUrised Facebook Apps</a>:</p>

<p>Several people were blogging the conference (and twittering throughout it) so I didn't, just for a change... and as a result I felt I personally got less out of the sessions than I would have if I had been blogging...</p>

<p>That said, <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/">Patrick</a> and <a href="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/">Doug</a> did an excellent job of reviewing the sessions they were in, with posts appearing more or less immediately each speaker finished.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they didn't use conference tags to mark up their posts, so here's a search powered solution:</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Doug's blog posts from the <a href="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/?s=%22OU+conf:%22">OU Making Connections conference</a>.<br />
&nbsp;- Patrick's blog posts from the <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/?s=%22Making%20Connections%20-%22">OU Making Connections conference</a> (Patrick - how come no search box on your Ochre blog? Thank goodness for standard URL patterns?!;-)</p>

<p>It would be more useful to have feeds of these posts of course - it being RSS Awareness day and all... but I'm gonna have to leave that as an exercise for the reader... ;-)</p>

<p>At the very end of January, I got an invite to contribute an expanded write up of my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012594.html">Google Calendar Map pipes mashup</a> to a book of Google Office hacks...</p>

<p>And it appears that the book is now officially out:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515881/"><img src="http://blogoscoped.com/files/google-apps-hacks-cover.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
   <br />
I got a preview copy a week or so ago - and it's packed with some really neat tips, tricks and hacks (although such is the pace of change in Google apps land that some of the hacks have already been superceded!).</p>

<p>Whilst the book is listed on the Amazon US site, it's not made it onto the UK site yet - though <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515881/">O'Reilly are selling it in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515881/chapter/index.html">list of contents</a>.</p>

<p>The book itself was actually written in Google docs (as described here: <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-23-n82.html">Writing a Book in Google Docs</a>) - I was sent a doc link and a couple of example hacks in the desired styling, and then edited the doc in full view of the book's main author, Phillip Lenssen, and the editor, Brian Jepson.</p>

<p>I know a couple of people in my dept are looking at the idea of compiling an edited book on the nature of information, so I'll maybe suggest to them that they take the Google docs route too...!<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gohacks" rel="tag">gohacks</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/googe%20apps%20hacks" rel="tag">googe apps hacks</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
