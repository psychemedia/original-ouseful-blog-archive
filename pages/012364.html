<h3 class="title">delicious Inline Images from flickr</h3>

<p>Maybe delicious has been doing this for sometime and I've not particularly noticed before... or maybe this is new? Previewing images from flickr, at least, in bookmark listings...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2178592350/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2171/2178592350_8b914fc04d.jpg" alt="2008-01-08_1727" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="225" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Do we like or not? The simplicity of the delicious interface has been one of its saving graces for me.</p>

<p>The same <em>used</em> to be true of the Google search listings too, before universal search...</p>

<p>PS readers may have noticed an increasing number of screenshots in my posts - that's because <a href="./012276.html">it's just so easy with Jing :-)</a>. Click, click and drag, click, paste - job done, with the image archived to (and pulled in from) flickr, and the embed code added automatically to my clipboard. <a href="http://jingproject.com">Easy, peasy, jingproject squeezy</a> :-)</p>

<p>PPS Who else noticed too that you'll soon be able to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/flickr_to_authenticate_openid.php">use your flickr page URL as an OpenID</a>? Now one, two, three - let me hear y'all - "OpenLearn - needs OpenID, OpenLearn - needs OpenID..." (as if...; we're all waiting for some other educational provider to lead the way on <em>that</em> one, because we know that everyone really wants to use a university ID for everything via Shibboleth (which is implemented by <em>all</em> the big consumer sites, like, ... err... :-)</p>

<p>PPPS now what <em>would</em> be really beneficial to OU students, and somehow 'registered' informal learners (like OpenLearners???) who are maybe welcomed onto university campuses, would be <a href="http://www.eduroam.org/">Eduroam</a> credentials? The OU missed a trick 10 years ago by not becoming a real - or reseller - ISP.

<p>... not indeed. Alex is experimenting with OpenID for MSG which we hope may go live on OpenLearn in the near future. We can then look at how to implement it more widely (time and money permitting of course ;)</p>

<p>Hi Tony,Andy,</p>

<p>Look, I'd really like to see the Open ID thing get a move on this year. I think we all intuit that it's the key to breaking down the Shibboleth reinforced status quo. But can we get over the singular domain focus on things. Ultimately, apart from saving us going bonkers with the million account syndrome, it needs to help our institutions to share users and the level of authority (access) they are allowed. Would yu like to consider doing a little twinning with http://www.groups.edna.edu.au/ ?</p>

<p>And this year, rather just filling the blogs, could be do a little more communicating?<br />
