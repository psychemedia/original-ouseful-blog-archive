<h3 class="title">Visualising CoAuthors in Open Repostory Online Papers, Part 1</h3>

<p>In <a href="./014965.html">ORO Search by Name Pipes Interface</a> I described a Yahoo pipe for extracting author information from papers listed in the OU's open repository, and outlined some of the potential author naming ambiguities that arise when using ORO reference data as author metadata. In this post, I'll describe my initial attempt at visualising co-author relations using the Moowheel javascript visualisation library. In a couple of follow on posts, I look at some rather more 'correct' visualisations using both Moowheel and Many Eyes.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with it, Moowheel constructs a circular display of points that are connected to each other by some relation when provided with a set of data organised in an appropriate way. For example, in <a href="./014570.html">delicious Tags'n'users Wheel</a> I used Moowheel to show the tags used by different users who had bookmarked a particular URL on delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/demo.php?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2498112816_d6915d716d.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="468" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Hovering over a username highlights the tags they used to bookmark the original link.</p>

<p>In Moowheel v0.1 at least, the data must be supplied in a form similar to: (a, b, c), (c, a, d), (b, c, e), (d, a), (e). To construct the circle, each item (a, b, c, d, e) must be present as the first item in a set; each set describes the items that are connected to each other in some way.) Links are highlighted to members of a set when the first item in the set is hovered over.</p>

<p>So here's how I first thought to try to visualise the co-authors of an ORO paper - the source is a results listing for a <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/perl/search/simple?meta=&amp;meta_merge=ALL&amp;person=pillinger&amp;person_merge=ALL&amp;date=&amp;_satisfyall=ALL&amp;_order=byyear&amp;_action_search=Search">search on ORO by author "pillinger"</a>:</p>

<p>- construct a list of unique authors and use this to create the unique items on the circle: (author1), (author2), (author3), ..., (authorN).<br />
- construct sets of the form: (author1, author2), (author1, author2), ..., (author3, author1, authorN) - where the first set are the authors of paper1, the second set are the authors of paper2, and so on.</p>

<p>My hope was that the Moowheel would then plot out the connections between all the authors who had ever coauthored a paper together that had also included a "pillinger" as an author. Here's a sample result:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/orodemo.php" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2009/2651292446_7dca7662d6.jpg" alt="moowheel oro authors 1" height="478" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>You'll see that some authors are depicted multiple times, but with no connections. What Moowheel v0.1, at least, seems to be doing is only display the connections for a non-singleton set where the first term in the set occurs with other set members for the first time(?) (There was also originally some ambiguity in actual author names; for example, "PIllinger, CT", "Pillinger, C" and "Pilinger, Colin" all appear in the results list - see <a href="./014962.html">Dirty Name Data in the OU Open Repository Online</a> for a discussion about this; in the above demo, I went overboward and just used the surname, which combined results fro "Pillinger, C" and "Pillinger, J"...;-)</p>

<p>If you want to have a play with the Moowheel, you can find it here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/orodemo.php?author=pillinger">ORO viz demo 1</a>.</p>

<p>In order to cope with authors appearing multiple times along the outside edges of the graph, I guessed that I needed to construct non-singleton sets that were started with a unique identifier, so I added a level of indirection that related authors with the papers that had contributed to:</p>

<p>- construct a list of unique authors;<br />
- construct sets headed by unique authors, and the papers they had contributed to, and use this to create the unique items on the circle: (author1, paper1, paper2), (author2, paper1), (author3, paper2, paperN), ..., (authorN, paper2).<br />
- construct sets for each paper listing the authors who had contributed to that paper: (paper1, author1, author2), (paper2, author1, author3), ..., (paperN, author3).</p>

<p>Here's the result (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/orodemo2.php?author=pillinger">ORO viz demo 2</a> NB there's a niggle somewhere in the code which means that for some few results listings, the wheel doesn't display... Also, the pipe canlt cope with overlong results listings Ideally, ORO would produce it's own RSS/JSON output...:-(:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/moowheel_v01/demo/orodemo2.php" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3058/2651308026_eac86efc3d.jpg" alt="oro author papers" height="467" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This time, if you hover over the name of an author, the links to the papers they contributed to will be highlighted. If you hover over a paper reference, the authors who contributed to it will be highlighted.</p>

<p>In order to see which authors had coauthored with whom, I guess I'd need to hack the Moowheel code so that if I hovered over an author, the links to papers they had contributed to would be highlighted, and the 'activated' papers would then in turn highlight the links to the authors who had contributed to those papers...</p>

<p>Whilst I haven't tried that approach, I did find another way of visualising who had coauthored with whom - as I'll describe in my next post... :-)<br />
