<div class="blogbody">

<h3 class="title">Innovating from the Inside, Outside</h3>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, the OU hosted a workshop with several external consultants about OUr visionary future web strategy (presumably?) <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/04/new_university_.html">Martin Weller</a> gave the heads-up, <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/work/2007/04/open_universiti.html">Stowe Boyd</a> (one of the consultants) added a bit more detail - like suggesting this is an ongoing project - and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/04/new_university__1.html">Martin responded</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I can't find any documentation internally on this workshop/project (yet!) - though even if I could, it'd probably have to remain behind the firewall... (along with the new <em>VCE Dashboard</em> (internal readers can find a link on intranet home page, in one of the right hand navigation column panels...;-)).</p>

<p>[What follows is all a bit <em>I and me, and me and I</em>, for which I (!) apologise - but I (!?) don't really want to rewrite it all in a neutral voice just now...]</p>

<p>One thing that struck me about this workshop that the ideas are coming from the <em>outside, in</em>, which contrasts with something I've been meaning to post for some time now: <em>inside, outside</em> working...</p>

<blockquote>There's no way I could have made any of the OUseful/OpenLearn toys (like <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, or the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn<em>_XMLProcessor</em></a>, for example) <em>until</em> the OpenLearn project made the XML course unit files available under an open content/Creative Commons license.</blockquote>

<p>For example, there was no way of getting XML versions of course materials that I could play with and publish on the <em>public</em> web.</p>

<p>That isn't to say that internally access wasn't available to XML structured content: for example, the OU short courses are generated from XML source documents (although these are not defined at the unit level - they use an XML document format defined at the <em>page</em> level - which I've argued against for the last 3 or 4 years...!).</p>

<p>It's just that being able to play with content that is still being delivered to students in live courses is just not done...</p>

<p>And of course, there are 'technical issues' too - materials locked behind an OU firewall require authentication before they can be viewed (even XML files). Which means that using third party tools to process them isn't really possible...</p>

<p>(The fact that many of the services I'm using didn't actually exist even a few months ago is neither here or there... it's also worth bearing in mind that quite a few of the third party services used in OUseful apps have benefitted (maybe?!) from feedback I've been able to provide as a result of using those apps for OUseful demos. In addition, OUseful tinkering has also generated more than a few feature requests and bug reports to third party services and maybe, maybe, contributed implicitly to knowledge transfer activity, albeit untracked.)</p>

<p>Another advantage of <em>inside, outside</em> working is that I've been able to bring to bear my knowledge of how OU courses are designed and put together to be able to atomise/disaggregate them in ways that hopefully make sense (e.g. by RSSifying the content).</p>

<p>I guess I can also justify the considerable amount of time I spend in OUseful displacement activity on OpenLearn related activites <em>because</em> I work for the OU (even though I am not part of the OpenLearn project). Again, an <em>inside</em> justifcation for this.</p>

<p>The power of working from the <em>outside</em>, of course, is that <em>anyone</em> could be doing this stuff - and I can't be <em>stopped</em> from doing it (in my own time, of course; hmmm....)</p>

<p>Partly for this reason, I try to ensure that OUseful doodle apps do not require any privileged access to Open University services (just like I try to ensure that news I post on this public blog can be found on the OU public website... okay, maybe I find the info on the intranet first, and then look for a public route in to it, but hey, at the end of the day it's the public who's paying for what we do...;-)</p>

<p>In many cases, an OU server <em>is</em> used to host stuff; but wherever possible, tools are written using client-side Javascript to implement functionality (and making "View Source" trivial), relayed RSS feeds/JSON used to ensure that clients don't suffer form proxy/security problems arising from trying to access feeds from OU domains, and so on.</p>

<p>So: one of the biggest payoffs for me about OpenLearn is that it allows me to indulge in <em>inside, outside</em> working.</p>

<p>For example, there's no problem using third party tools, services and applications in the services I want to develop.</p>

<p>It also means that skunkworks and side projects can be entertained <em>without</em> having to worry about leaking copyrighted/rights protected materials, for example - or having to obtain permission to try out various novel delivery models using either the materials <em>or</em> external, third party tools.</p>

<p>And because the materials are there, and freely available, <em>anyone</em> can use them...</p>

<p>...which includes - and this may come as a surprise to many - people <em>on the inside</em>...</p>

<p>So the general lesson here is that if an organisation opens up its content or services, for example, then its employees can innovate with those resources <em>without</em> the need for official sanction...</p>

<p>...if, that is, they have 20% time (or study leave, in the OU case), or they are prepared to burn a bit of midnight oil.</p>

<p>So for me, then, the opening up of content (and services) also opens up <em>inside, outside</em> working opportunities, enabling individuals who want to try out work-related innovation that the institution won't necessarily allocate resource to, to pursue that <em>internal</em> innovation <em>outside</em> the confines of work (in all the forms those confines take).</p>

<p>NB note that none of this applies if you have a life, do the work you are supposed to do, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/386-dont-be-a-hero-giving-up-is-good">don't  need to be a hero</a> etc! ;-)</p>
