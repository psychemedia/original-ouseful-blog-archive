<h3 class="title">OU Job Ads Roundup...</h3>

<p>A part of me is a little bit reluctant to keep making this sort of post quite so frequently, but seeing the jobs that are being advertised in the OU is quite a good indicator of where various priorities were a couple of months ago (when the posts were presumably secured...;-)</p>

<p>So let's see what's currently open that may be of interest to <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a> readers... As ever, I have absolutely nothing to do with the appointment of any of the below:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2869"> Business Systems Analysts / Application Developers, Academic & Administrative Computing Services</a>: "Many of our projects are to deliver business change, and we are particularly interested in hearing from analysts with business process design experience. A flexible approach is essential. While Microsoft.net is our main development platform, we also support a wide variety of legacy systems and use packaged software, including Siebel's Customer Relationship Management and Documentum's Enterprise Content Management software."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2870&ref=ext"> Media Developer - Editing (possible trainee position), Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a>: "we are looking for an experienced editor from book, journal or online publishing to contribute to the production and delivery of distance learning materials. You will edit learning materials from our Faculty of Mathematics & Computing. Our editors, working as media developers, make a critical contribution to the quality of our courses, collaborating closely with academics and other specialists to deliver world-class learning materials across a wide range of media and disciplines."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2826&ref=ext">ICT Development Officer (Faculty of Education and Language Studies)</a>: "An internal secondment has provided the opportunity for someone who is able to formulate ICT systems and web policies to join us on a fixed-term contract. As the Faculty's principal source of advice and expertise in these areas, you will design, manage and evaluate support systems and web projects."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2825&ref=ext">Systems and Network Administrator, Creating The Next Generation Web, Knowledge Media Institute</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for a Systems & Network Administrator who will join the IT & Systems Team and support the day to day Linux and Windows network services. You should have a good track record of working with and supporting Linux in the context of a large organization."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2886&ref=ext">Two Research Fellows: Audio-visual Content Analysis and Search Engines (Knowledge Media Institute)</a>: "The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute has an opening for two Postdoctoral Research Fellows to undertake research in within the context of an EU/IST-funded integrated project, PHAROS, which is the main IP funded by the EU in a recent call on audio-visual search technologies. The PHAROS project aims to build a next generation audiovisual search platform, to be designed, developed and applied jointly by a consortium consisting of leading academic and industrial players with proven track records in innovation and commercial success. The Multi-Media Information systems group of the KMi is the key player in developing core search technologies within this project including advanced content-based visual search engine and visual content analysis."</li></ul><br />
There's also this post, I notice:</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2860&ref=ext"> Head of Directorate, Marketing and Sales</a>: this one seems to come up regularly (or maybe I'm just confused...?). If so, then presumably career marketeers are only good for one project per organisation to keep their CV ticking over. Achieving things like a rebranding exercise, for example, or <a href="./009219.html">establishing a relationship with a large affiliate scheme</a>;-)</p>

<p>On the marketing front, I hope that whoever gets the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2868&ref=ext">Online Marketing Manager (Marketing and Sales)</a> post talks to any appointed <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2884&ref=ext">Assistant Alumni Manager (Open University Business School)</a> about linking at least a few of the 2 million+ OU alumni into to some sort of social network...</p>

<p>[If you go for any of the above posts, please mention that you saw it mentioned on <em>OUseful.info</em> (or perhaps it's better that you don't??? ;-). I also expect a coffee in your first couple of weeks of taking up any post :-)]</p>
