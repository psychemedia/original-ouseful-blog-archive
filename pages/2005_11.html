<h3 class="title">Distributed Social Bookmarking</h3>

<p>Over the last few weeks I've chatted to several people who run social bookmarking applications about the potential for using such systems in a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">managed environment</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main discussion points has been on the topic of how splitting a userbase into discrete non-sharing groups will potentially weaken the usefulness of the system. I am not so sure - but this may be because the scale I think of is the scale  of courses the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">OU</a> runs (500-1000 students), which is typically an order of magnitude larger than the numbers of students on a particular course in a traditional university.</p>

<p>Related to this is the question of whether <em>additional</em> benefits can be accrued by allowing <em>different</em> social bookmarking installations to co-operate in a distributed social bookmarking environment.</p>

<p>So what might such a system look like? I do not anticipate answering this question in this post, but hopefully I'll be able to identify some of the issues...</p>

<p><strong>Distributed social bookmarking</strong><br />
Several scenarios immediately suggest themselves to me:<ol><li>Sharing between different users or different groups defined within a single social bookmarking system;</li><li>Sharing bookmarks between different installations of the <em>same</em> environment. For example, I could quite easily imagine different academic research groups in the same organisation installing their own version of Connotea, and at some later date wanting to share information across those installations whilst retaining them all as independent installations;</li><li>Sharing bookmarks between <em>different</em> applications, for example between del.icio.us and Connotea. An example of this scenario may be an academic researcher who maintains their own social bookmarking account to provide continuity as they more from post to post, institution to institution, and yet would like to share this resource with the institutional social bookmarking service at their host instituion. Another example might be <em>ad hoc</em> groups that form across social bookmarking applications, e.g. amongst attendees at a workshop or collaborators on a particular project.</li></ol> </p>

<p>This latter example - of being able to form <em>ad hoc</em> groups within, between and across social bookmarking systems, and freely share and search resources amongst the group members - would seem to provide an excellent test case for three aspects if interoperability in the distributed social bookmarking environment mentioned above.</p>

<p>To make the idea more concrete, imagine the following scenario: five partners are involved in an international project. Each partner has access to their own social bookmarking environment which each is keen to continue using. Two of the partners are at the same institution, using the same system (a local installation of Connotea, for example), one is using a local installation of Connotea at another institution, one uses the public NPG hosted version of Connotea and one uses del.icio.us. In order to both protect confidentiality of certain personal bookmarks, and minimise the number of irrelevant links shared between group members, there is a suggestion that an <em>ad hoc</em> private group is set-up across the individual bookmarking systems.</p>

<p>Discuss...</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Bookmarking Interoperability</h3>

<p>With an increasing number of social bookmarking systems now available, to what extent would it be useful if it were possible to share bookmarks across these systems?</p>

<p>If social bookmarking systems are to become loosely coupled components in a distributed virtual learning environment (VLE), then conforming to common interface standards would allow different systems to be swapped in an out of such an environment without breaking other components.</p>

<p>One particular question I'd like to raise in this post - and to which I expect to return quite frequently as I work through and follow the technical issues - is whether or not there is any benefit in standardising some elements of social bookmarking applications.</p>

<p>What I am particularly interested in it terms of payoff is:<br />
a) the ability to swap different social bookmarking systems in and out of a hybrid environment (e.g. a VLE or social software suite containig different applications - blogs, wikis, social bookmarking etc.);<br />
b) the ability to create a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005336.html">distributed social bookmarking service</a>.</p>

<p>So what elements might we consider standardising?</p>

<p>There are several that immediately come to mind:<ol><li>URL structure for referring to user tags</li><li>RSS structure, for syndicating linkrolls;</li><li>the structure of tag groups;</li><li>the structure of user groups;</li><li>open APIs;</li><li>bookmarklets.</li></ol></p>

<p>I'm not going to focus on all these issues in this post, but I would like to look at the first two. If you run a social bookmarking service, please feel free to chip in with comments and corrections. If I had access to a public wiki, I'd actually post there, because I think this topic would benefit from a community discussion, but for now I'll stick with the blog. I also think this sort of discussion could usefully add to the excellent comparative work done on social bookmarking by <a href="http://www.irox.de/roxomatic/856">Torsten Rox</a>.</p>

<p>I'm also going to limit myself in this post to comparing just two social bookmarking services - <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http:/connotea.org">Connotea</a>. This will let me try and work out some just what sorts of comparisons I want to make and how I'm going to make them. If I can sort some sort of methodology out, (and find some time somewhere) perhaps I'll work on this as a proper research project...:-)</p>

<p><strong>URL structure</strong><br />
Let's look at some examples, first:</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://del.icio.us/help/navigation">del.icio.us</a> navigation:</em></strong><br />
http://del.icio.us/{rss/}[tag/ OR <em>username</em>/ OR url/][<em>tag</em> {+<em>tag</em>} ? <em>URL</em>]<br />
where [] denotes a <em>required</em> element and {} denotes an <em>optional</em> element. <em>Emphasized</em> elements are placeholders. <em>?</em> denotes context sensitive.</p>

<p>For example, <ul><li>Reference by <em>user</em>: <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia">del.icio.us/psychemedia/</a></li><li>Reference by <em>tag</em>: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/socialbookmarking">del.icio.us/tag/socialbookmarking</li><li>Reference by <em>user</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>tag</em>: <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/socialbookmarking">del.icio.us/psychemedia/socialbookmarking</a></li><li>Reference by two tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/socialbookmarking+folksonomy">del.icio.us/tag/socialbookmarking+folksonomy</a></li><li>Reference by URL: <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/7e16126ee5fe4f320852b731206c2eac">del.icio.us/url/7e16126ee5fe4f320852b731206c2eac</a></li></ul></p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://connotea.org">Connotea</a> navigation:</em></strong><br />
http://www.connotea/{rss/}[tag/ OR name/ OR uri/][<em>tag</em>{+<em>tag</em>} ? <em>username</em> ? <em>URI</em>]{?tag/<em>tag</em>{+<em>tag</em>}}</p>

<p>For example, <ul><li>Reference by <em>user</em>: <a href="http://www.connotea.org/user/ben">www.connotea.org/user/ben</a></li><li>Reference by <em>tag</em>: <a org/tag/socialbookmarking</li><li>Reference by user <strong>and</strong> tag: <a href="http://www.connotea.org/user/ben/tag/connotea">www.connotea.org/user/ben/tag/connotea</a></li><li>Reference by two tags: <a href="http://www.connotea.org/">www.connotea.org/tag/socialbookmarking+folksonomy</a></li><li>Reference by URI:<a href="http://www.connotea.org/uri/7e16126ee5fe4f320852b731206c2eac">www.connotea.org/uri/7e16126ee5fe4f320852b731206c2eac</a></li></ul></p>

<p><strong>Comparison of del.icio.us and Connotea URLs></strong></p>

<p>Reference by <em>tag</em> is handled the same way in both services: $DOMAIN$/tag/<em>tag</em>{+<em>tag</em>}</p>

<p>Reference by <em>user</em> is handled differently: del.icio.us goes straight to the username ($DOMAIN$/<em>username</em>) whereas Connotea interposes a <em>user</em> path element ($DOMAIN$/user/<em>username</em>).</p>

<p>Reference by URI/URL differs in the pathname only ($DOMAIN$/url/ in del.icio.us, $DOMAIN$/uri in Connotea).</p>

<p>What was interesting - at least for the single URI/URL bookmark comparison I made - was the the encoding of the same page (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005136.html">Seven Ways of Using Social Bookmarking - http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005136.html</a>)  resulted in the same encoded reference (7e16126ee5fe4f320852b731206c2eac).</p>

<p>Reference by use <em>and</em> tag is in my opinion better managed in del.icio.us ($DOMAIN$/<em>username</em>/<em>tag</em>) than Connotea ($DOMAIN$/user/<em>username</em>/tag/<em>tag</em>).</p>

<p>The differences between URL naming schemes is minor, and if consistency were really necessary could be addressed using <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/urlrewriting.html">URL rewrites</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, both services provide an RSS feed by the simple insertion of an <em>rss</em> path element immediately after the domain ($DOMAIN$/rss/<em>etc.</em>).</p>

<p>Which leads nicely into the next comparison - how alike are the RSS feeds from del.icio.us and Connotea?</p>

<p><strong>RSS feed structure</strong></p>

<p>First, a snippet from del.icio.us:<br />
<tt>&lt;item rdf:about="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0508/0508082.pdf"&gt;<br />

&lt;/taxo:&gt;<br />
&lt;/item&gt;</tt></p>

<p>And one from Connotea:<br />

 &lt;annotate:reference rdf:resource="http://www.connotea.org/comments/uri/a59e3122ddb15bd4c1f64bee65b78662" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/item&gt;</tt></p>

<p>Let's go through them a line at a time:</p>

<p>D: &lt;item rdf:about="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0508/0508082.pdf"&gt;<br />
C: &lt;item rdf:about="http://www.connotea.org/user/tonyh/uri/a59e3122ddb15bd4c1f64bee65b78662"&gt;<br />
del.icio.us makes the post about the actual resource, Connotea makes it about the Connotea reference to the resource.</p>

<p>D: &lt;title&gt;The Structure of Collaborative Tagging Systems&lt;/title&gt;<br />
C: &lt;title&gt;The Structure of Collaborative Tagging Systems&lt;/&gt;<br />
Coherence :-)</p>

<p>D: &lt;link&gt;http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0508/0508082.pdf&lt;/link&gt;<br />
C: &lt;link&gt;http://www.connotea.org/user/tonyh/uri/a59e3122ddb15bd4c1f64bee65b78662&lt;/link&gt;<br />
Again - a difference in what we are actually referring to...</p>

<p>Connotea then has a description tag that contains the same info as the following Dublin Core tags:<br />
C:  &lt;description&gt;Posted by tonyh to bookmarking dynamics Social on Fri Nov 25 &lt;/&gt;</p>

<p><em>D: &lt;dc:creator&gt;psychemedia&lt;/dc:creator&gt;<br />
D: &lt;dc:date&gt;2005-11-25T16:21:39Z&lt;/dc:date&gt;<br />
D: &lt;dc:subject&gt;bookmarking dynamics social&lt;/dc:subject&gt;<br />
C: &lt;dc:creator&gt;tonyh&lt;/dc:creator&gt;<br />
C: &lt;dc:&gt;2005-11-25T16:21:05Z&lt;/dc:date&gt;<br />
C: &lt;dc:subject&gt;bookmarking&lt;/dc:subject&gt;<br />
C: &lt;dc:subject&gt;dynamics&lt;/dc:subject&gt;<br />
C: &lt;dc:subject&gt;Social&lt;/dc:subject&gt;</em><br />
The main difference here is in the way the subject tag is used. del.icio.us space separates the tags in a single subject line, whereas Connotea uses a separate subject line for each, which it is absolutely allowed to do. The Connotea approach is a little cleaner, I think.</p>

<p>D:&lt;taxo:topics&gt;<br />
D:  &lt;rdf:Bag&gt;<br />
D:   &lt;rdf:li resource="http://del.icio.us/tag/dynamics" /&gt;<br />
D:   &lt;rdf:li resource="http://del.icio.us/tag/social" &gt;<br />
D:   &lt;rdf:li resource="http://del.icio.us/tag/bookmarking" /&gt;<br />
D:  &lt;/rdf:Bag&gt;<br />
D: &lt;/taxo:&gt;<br />
Here, del.icio.us provides an alernative way of accessing the tags by exploiting the <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/taxonomy/">RSS Taxonomy namespace</a>.</p>

<p>C: &lt;connotea:uri&gt;<br />
C:  &lt;dcterms:URI rdf:about="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0508/0508082.pdf"&gt;<br />
C:   &lt;dc:title&gt;0508082.pdf (application/pdf Object)&lt;/dc:title&gt;<br />
C:  &lt;/dcterms:URI&gt;<br />
C: &lt;/connotea:uri&gt;<br />
In contrast, Connotea offers an additional alternative way of accessing the URI of the resource, using the <a href="http://www.connotea.org/2005/01/schema#"">connotea namespace</a> (although bear in mind that the &lt;link&gt; reference in Connotea was to the Connotea reference of that URI). The Connotea RDF feed also references the Taxonomy namespace, although it doesn't use it.</p>

<p>The use of the Dublin Core <em>subject</em> field is increasingly accepted as the correct place to record tag information, although as the above demonstrates it is still possibly to use this tag inconsistently. The Connotea approach does seem clearer, as it allows for more direct manipulation (using the DOM) of the user's tags.</p>

<p>The other major difference is in the use of the &lt;link&gt; field. The del.icio.us approach - of referring directly to bookmarked URL, offers an immediate link to the resource. The COnnotea approach, however, uses a level of indirection through the Connotea reference for that resource, which allows for the bookarking system to track click-thrus more comprehensively.</p>

<p>The indirection affroded by the Connotea approach also allows for alternative references for the resource to be used in an invisible way (e.g. where a resource may be ssotgred in several different locations, there is a many-one relationship between locations the resource can be found and the resource itedlef. The Connotea approach, of encouring users to go via the Connotea representation of the resource location, potentially accommodates this many-one mapping by masking the actuial address from which the resource is served.)</p>

<h3 class="title">OurLibrary</h3>

<p>I've just been quickly looking through <a title="Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters" href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/librarians-guide.shtml">Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters</a>, and immediately started wondering what a social version - <em>Our</em>Library, if you like - might look like...</p>

<p>(Long suffering readers may remember I did a simpler thought experiment for the OU <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES</a> system in the form of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003234.html">Social ROUTES</a>.)</p>

<p>So anyway  - here's some of the MyLibrary stuff that looked like it could be sociable (the empasized quotes are all taken form the <a title="Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters" href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/librarians-guide.shtml">Issues...</a>  document):</p>

<p><em>"Being a portal sort of application, the content of MyLibrary must be updated frequently or your patrons will cease to use it. You and your staff probably feel your time is already limited. Consequently, you might have to streamline other services, reallocate time and energy, or hire new staff in order to keep MyLibrary running in a manner truly beneficial to your patrons. MyLibrary does not necessarily make your work easier; MyLibrary is a framework for providing Web-based information services in a manner increasingly expected by the typical user of the Internet."</em></p>

<p>Hmm - seems like you need the users to help out here...</p>

<p><em>"Developing a collection management policy for MyLibrary is essential. This policy, along with the controlled vocabulary (described in the next section), provide the intellectual framework for the entire service."</em></p>

<p>Controlled vovablulary...hmmm...ok - if this was a tag based system, you could make recommenadations from the controlled vocabulary. The question arises as to who the controlled voacbulary is supposed to be useful for, of course. If the vocabulary is there to help users locate resources by themselves, perhaps a folksonomy <em>would</em> be more useful?</p>

<p><em>"The collection management policy articulates the qualities of the information resources you will be including in the system."</em></p>

<p>Okay - how about if these resources are based on user recommendations, either implicit ones (clips, bookmarks etc.) or explicit ones (user ratings etc.)?</p>

<p><em>"For better or for worse, the functionality of MyLibrary is predicated on the existence of a flat, controlled vocabulary of subject terms called "disciplines." Everything from the librarians to the information resources to the users of MyLibrary itself are classified with this controlled vocabulary. Without this classification system associations cannot be made between librarians and patrons, patrons and resources, or resources and librarians. The disciplines glue the entire system together."</em></p>

<p>Okay - if there are any tag evangelists out there, do you want to post a comment or two picking up on any of this? (e.g. <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/01/07/folksonomies_controlled_vocabularies.php">here is a debate</a> from the start of this year, and here's <a href="http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html">an paper</a> on a similar topic).</p>

<p><em>"Because of limitations in the systems's implementation, the list of disciplines must be flat, not hierarchial."</em></p>

<p>:-)</p>

<p><em>"The list must be granular enough to satisfy the classification needs of the resources <strong>as well as the interests of the patrons</strong></em> [my emphasis]<em>. At the same time, the list can not be so finely grained that it grows too long to be usable. Try to create a vocabulary that reflects your patrons' needs."</em></p>

<p>Perhaps by letting the users tag stuff themselves, but give them huge hint conditions by offering up the preferred vocabulary terms? For example, the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/buttons">post to del.icio.us</a> bookmarklet pops up a posting indow that contins the user's own tags, as well as suggested/recommended tags based on other users' classification of the resource being bookmarked.</p>

<p><em>"It is recommended that you limit your vocabulary to no more than fifty (50) headings. Larger institutions will require larger controlled vocabulary lists."</em></p>

<p>Sound advice there, perhaps - my taglist on del.icio.us is getting ridiculously long...<br />
 <br />
<em>"Finally, it is imperative you define your disciplines before you do any data-entry. While it is a trivial process to re-classify sets of items in MyLibrary with other discipline headings, removing disciplines that have been assigned to many items requires a process of retrospective conversion that could be avoided if the disciplines are articulated 'correctly' in the first place. A lot of planning now will save even more time later."</em></p>

<p>Hmm - I don;t have that problem reclassifying my del.icio.us bookmarks...</p>

<p><em>"You now need to determine who is going to be providing MyLibrary services. These services include:<ul><li>adding and deleting discipline headings</li><li>adding, classifying, checking, and deleting information resources</li><li>posting global messages as well as messages from the librarians</li><li>sending email messages</li><li>managing patron accounts"</li></ul></em></p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for the reader to determine who provides the above services in a social bookmarking system like del.icio.us or Connotea (please feel free to pst your answer as a comment). Alternatively, who would be responsible in a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">Managaed Social Bookmarking Environment</a>?</p>

<p><em>"The system was designed to be maintained by two sets of people: 1) a webmaster and 2) librarians who specialize in various disciplines...The librarians' responsibilities lie in the maintenance of information resources and the posting of discipline-specific messages. They should be more than familiar with the discipline list. They should be passionate about their disciplines and their profession or their regular performance. Their regular appraisals should include evaluations of MyLibrary implementation. Otherwise there will be little incentive for keeping MyLibrary up-to-date."</em></p>

<p>!</p>

<p><em>"The maintenance of MyLibrary relies on trust, frequent communication between librarians, and a sense of good will. Librarians must trust other service providers not to overwrite their work. Librarians must believe other librarians are going to include valid content in the system. Communication has to take place between all librarians so everybody knows what the others are doing. Everybody has to work under the same set of collection management policies and discipline lists. If somebody wants to add an item to the system, then there is nothing stopping them from doing so. This is an empowering feature. Results are immediate. On the other hand, if you create an atmosphere of centrality, then results will be less immediate and librarians may take less pride in their work and feel less in control. Remember, the names of the librarians are listed right there on every MyLibrary page."</em></p>

<p>Librarians? Not users? Why the distinction? (Bear in mind that the MyLibrary concept predates social bookmarking - but how well would this read if it were recast in the language of social bookmarking/digital resource management? [That was a Lazyweb request, by the way, just in case you didn't notice...])</p>

<p><em>"The actual maintenance of MyLibrary requires brain work and a willingness to use the system's administrative interface. The brain work relies on the ability of the librarians to identify information resources complying with all the policies outlined in the previous sections. Do the resources fit the collection management policy? Can they be classified with one or more of the discipline headings? If not, then the resource must be excluded from the system or the policies must be revised."</em></p>

<p>If you have to rewrite the policy every time you find a useful resource not covered by it, why not just dump the policy and TRUST the users (err, that is, librarians...)?</p>

<p><em>"After information resources are successfully identified, they can be added to the system using the administrative interface. It is a cyclical process involving the completion of simple HTML forms. The process includes:<ol><li>updating discipline headings</li><li>updating librarians classifying them accordingly</li><li>updating information resources classifying them accordingly</li><li>updating discipline defaults</li><li>updating global as well as discipline-specific messages</li><li>sending email to patrons as well as librarians</li><li>evaluating</li><li>returning to Step #3"</li></ol></em></p>

<p>Phew...rather you than me, Ms Librarian, sir, ma'am...! ;-)</p>

<p><em>"The most complete analysis will come from the use of sophisticated SQL queries applied against the MyLibrary database. Given the system's "database dictionary" enumerating it's tables and fields, a person familiar with SQL will be able, today, to answer questions such as:<ul><li>What are the most/least popular disciplines?</li><li>What disciplines use the service the most?</li><li>What are the most/least common resources placed in patrons' profiles?</li><li>On the average, how many times per X do pe ople visit the system from discipline Y?</li><li>Is resource X a part of peoples' profiles who have discipline Y?</li><li>How much do people change their disciplines from the recommended list?</li><li>How often are resources from multiple disciplines placed in peoples' profiles?"</li></ul></em></p>

<p>Some useful tips for user reports there, I think, for developers of social bookmarking systems...</p>

<p><em>"The evaluation/implementation cycle of MyLibrary is unending. Technology changes. Expectations evolve. Roles get modified. Budgets grow and shrink. You know all this. MyLibrary is no exception. Based on your experience, continue with MyLibrary by starting over again with the first step or simply stop using MyLibrary."</em></p>

<p>Exactly...</p>

<h3 class="title">Blogging to an Institutional Repository</h3>

<p>To what extent should informal web publications - such as blog posts, Wiki contributions, and even social bookmarks - be classed as 'proper' publications, and to what extent are they just part of an everday informal channel of academic discourse like a corridor meeting, seminar discussion, or conference chat?</p>

<p>Over recent months, there has been a push in UK HE towards the adoption of institutional repositories for collating the research output of an institution, and perhaps testing the waters of <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/summary.pdf">Open Access publication</a>. If there <em>is</em> a part for infomal yet 'peer reviewed' channels - like blogs - to play in citable discourse (and even corridor conversations and email chats can be cited as <em>personal communication</em>), then should institutional repositories be somehow archiving those citable moments?</p>

<p>I used to play the research publication game in a very small way (e.g. <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/tony/publications.html">here are my research publications</a>) but in recent years I have become less and less productive, publication wise, which is not likely to do my academic career prospects many favours!</p>

<p>However, I have started blogging more and more, and hope that in some small way this is contributing something of value to my peer group. [Or perhaps not... <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2130466/">Attack of the Career-Killing Blogs: When academics post online, do they risk their jobs?</a>]</p>

<p>The way I use my blogs, as much as anything, is to record notes and snippets of stuff I’ve done that may be useful and/or of interest to others, or may be useful for me personally at a later date (can you tell I never throw anything away?). There is always the danger, of course, that <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2130466/">this blog may be bad for my career</a>... </p>

<p>Even so, from time to time it may be that academics who blog may publish a post that resonates with more than a few readers, and that in a small way becomes citable, e.g. through other blog posts or public bookmarks, for example.</p>

<p>Consequently, I think it's worth the blogging community asking the following question on a regular basis: <em>Should blog posts count as academic publishing?</em> And if so, <em>how should they be archived as a matter of record?</em></p>

<p>Just what to archive is an issue, of course. For example, this post on <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2004/11/26/post-or-perish">Post or Perish</a>   asks whether individual blog posts should be counted as separate publications, or the blog <em>as a whole</em> should be counted as a single publication.</p>

<p>Where a particular post becomes heavily cited, then potentially an individual post as publication may be appropriate.<br />
 <br />
In such a case, it may also be useful to preserve the post in a more formal environment, and I wonder whether <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/IR/ir.html">institutional repositories</a> should be able to offer this sort of facility? For example, might it be appropriate to provide a ‘research memo’ area of the repository into which significant blog posts could be logged, or at least archived with a permanent URL?</p>

<p>Where the blog as a whole becomes the publication, (and for sake of argument I shall suppose that it is well respected by the community, as for example according to <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/lists/librarian.php">Pubsub Community Rank</a> then we should perhaps consider whether it should count on an academic CV as a publication, or as evidence of esteem/reputation.</p>

<p>In general, I wonder whether there is a role for institutional librarians to act as guardians of  cited, but <em>informal</em> publications  - such as blog posts, or well referenced Wikipedia entries that don't get much revision -   especially if they are made available via websites that are part of the institution's domain, even if they are counted as 'personal' web pages as far as domain controllers are concerned (such as this blog, for example).</p>

<p>Even if posts aren't archived, then perhaps there is a role for institutions to run closed (to the institution) social bookmarking services <em>for the purposes simply of recording/archiving potentially citable links to digital resources produced by the instution's academic staff</em>? Or perhaps <em>post hoc</em> bookmarking informal research related resources that have known to become linked to widely from outside (e.g via something like <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/03/who-rates-this-page.html">Who Rates This Page?</a>).</p>

<p>The potential contribution of institutional repositories to formal reporting, such as in the UK's regular RAEs (Research Assessment Exercises) has been considered by Michael Day, from <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">UKOLN</a>, in his paper on <a href="http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/studies/rae/rae-study.pdf">Institutional repositories and research assessment</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know whether blog posts are, or should be, eligible for inclusion in <a href="http://www.rae.ac.uk">RAE 2008</a> returns. A quick inspection of the guidelines for the <a href="http://www.rae.ac.uk/pubs/2005/04/docs/f23.doc">Computer Science and Informatics</a> unit of assessment includes the following:</p>

<p><em><strong>Research Outputs, s.12:</strong> All forms of research output will be treated equally. The sub-panel expects to receive outputs in the form of books, chapters in books, articles in journals, conference contributions, and other formats including creative media and multimedia, standards documents, patents, products and processes, items of software, and technical reports, including consultancy reports. Outputs in all forms will be given equal consideration and the sub-panel acknowledges the breadth of publication practice in computer science and informatics.</p>

<p><strong>Research Outputs, s. 17: </strong> In assessing excellence the sub-panel will look for originality, innovation, significance, depth, rigour, influence on the discipline and wider fields and, where appropriate, relevance to users. The sub-panel will not use a rigid or formulaic method of assessing research quality. It will not use a formal ranked list of journals and it will not use impact factors or citation indices in a formulaic way.</p>

<p><strong>Esteem Indicators</strong>: 36.	Departments should list indicators of peer esteem and national and international recognition that relate to the staff submitted and were gained in the assessment period. The sub-panel will expect to see a range of esteem indicators, distributed across the department’s staff, appropriate to the size and staffing profile of the department. Indicators should be listed by individual and ordered by research group and may include:<ul><li>Awards, fellowships of learned societies, prizes, honours and named lectures</li><li>Personal research awards and fellowships</li><li>Keynote and plenary addresses at conferences</li><li>Significant professional service</li><li>National and international strategic advisory bodies</li><li>Industrial advisory roles</li><li>Editorial roles</li><li>Research co-ordination</li><li>Conference organisation (e.g. programme chairs and programme committee memberships)</li></ul></em></p>

<p>You'd need to be able to demonstrate a contribution to your peer group, of course. For example, that your blog was frequently referred to by members of your community, (but measured how? [e.g. <a href="http://www.blogpulse.com/trend?query1=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59&operator=and">Blogpulse</a> or <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/site_stats?site=blogs.open.ac.uk">PubSub</a> rank]); how useful a social bookmarker you are (but measured how? e.g. [<a href="http://collabrank.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/del.icio.us/?cmd=user_bookmarks&user=psychemedia">del.ico.us CollaborativeRank</a>]); or how major a Wikipedia contributor you are (but again, measured how?). <br />
  <br />
One important question that arises with respect to blog posts or Wikipedia entries is the permanence of the content of the post, particularly if the author is free to edit it over time, (as I occasionally do to these posts myself). In this case, care needs to be taken in considering the relationship between the archived copy of the post and the living document on the author’s blog itself.</p>

<p>At the very least, it would be useful to record somewhere the history of any changes to the post, much as the history tab of a page on Mediawiki records the evolution of a wiki page.</p>

<p>The preferred method of citing web references (e.g <em>?????? Accessed on: ??? from http://?????</em>) can thus be tracked  - via the history page – to a particular version instance of a post.</p>

<p>This issue of citing potentially dynamic sources poses all sorts of questions, I think, not least concerning the dynamic nature of academic discourse. This is something I shall have to go away and think about…</p>

<p>PS on the issues of repositories, this articule on <a href="http://www.knownet.com/knownet/writing/elearning2.0/entries/6666525074">Using simple online tools to 'make' a repository</a> is worth a read. It includes a section on making resources available by using social bookmarking.</p>

<h3 class="title">MyOpenLibrary, Frozen Child of MyLibrary</h3>

<p>First off - a confession. I thought that the OU's <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> was an in-house OU sourced package, but it seems I'm wrong: <a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/">MyLibrary</a> is actually a thriving third party system that the OU adopted for an extended trial <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/aboutus/myolib/index.html">some years ago</a> (&lt;-- that page breaks in Firefox...).</p>

<p>Secondly, although I suspect the OU installation is lagging behind in terms of its current version, my posts on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> and <a title="OUseful Info: Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005240.html">Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a>, with titles carefully crafted (?!) to pun <a href="http://web20workgroup.com/">Web 2.0</a>, are actually retrograde in that MyLibrary is currently at version 2.63 and set to go to version 3.0.</p>

<p>So that's me 'fessed up...</p>

<p>Anyway - now that I've found the MyLibrary site, I'll go and have a quick play to see if the direction it has gone in bears any resemblance to the MyOpenLibrary 2.0 tinkerings I've been blogging about for the last week.</p>

<p>I also need to go and do a bit more digging around the <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> 'Link Display Manager', which so far is the best app I've come across for feeding links into for display purposes.</p>

<p>One thing that I would like to be able to do in Netvibes, though, is to plug in arbitrary <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch</a> links...</p>

<h3 class="title">Even More OU Library RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>Thanks to James McNulty's Midas period in the OU Library over the last week, in which everything he touched turned to RSS, there is now a host of new RSS feeds available over and above those mentioned <a title="OUseful Info: More OU Library XML Feeds" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005227.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>First off, a feed for <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_patron_details.php?l_name=XXXX&barcode=NNNNN">User Loans info</a> (you'll find this link doesn't work without some necessary authentication data - name and Library Barcode to be exact...).</p>

<p>Then a host of feeds related to <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibray</a>. For example:</p>

<p><l><li>Ebooks: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_ebooks.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Databases: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_databases.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Journals: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_ejournals.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>ROUTES: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_routes.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Reference Shelf: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_reference.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>OpenUniversity Links <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_links.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Articles: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_recread.php?course=A840">Example feed for course A840</a></li><br />
<li>Help and Support: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_librarians.php?course=A840">Example feed for course A840</a></li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>NB To follow some of the links contained within the feeds you need to go in through the OU authentication system.</p>

<p>To make consuming sets of feeds easier - for example on a per course basis - I've started playing around with OPML files. For example, try this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/A300.opml">OPML file of feeds for A300</a>. It seems to work okay in Netvibes, at least...</p>

<p>PS Another addition: an RSS feed of <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_overdue.php?l_name=blah&barcode;=blah">my overdue library books</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PPS ROUTES XML SEARCH now available</strong: for example: <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish">http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish</a><br />
The search is currently over descriptions - James asks whether it should be over keywords... I wonder if it shoul dbe over both as a default?</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0</h3>

<p>One of the key issues related to course related <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> page that I didn't address in my post on <a title="OUseful Info: MyOpenLibrary 2.0" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> was the problem of seeding individual students' pages with link/topic boxes related to the courses the student is registered on.</p>

<p>What's really needed for any institutionally supported MyLibrary service is the ability to define profiles according to topic, or subject, area, registered course and so on, that provides a default setting for, or addition to, the MyLibrary desktop.</p>

<p>Rather usefully - from the point of view of feeding link lists into a MyLibrary service - <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> shows the way forward with its ability to import <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> lists of RSS feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesLoadOPML.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesLoadOPML.JPG" width="620" height="346" border="0" /></p>

<p>Once an OPML file is uploaded, the individual feeds are then offered in a list of feeds, from hich the user may choose to add tem to the desktop, rather than them being added to the desktop automatically:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesAddOPMLFeed.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesAddOPMLFeed.JPG" width="535" height="518" border="0" /></p>

<p>One other point worth mentioning here that I don't think I've mentioned before is that Netvibes allows users to place topic boxes in particular places on the desktop/canvas, albeit constrained by a 3 column grid (?or perhaps there are additional layout prefeneces I haven't come across yet that allow for even more flexibility in placing boxes?)</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Related Sites</strong></p>

<p>While on the topic, it's probably worth mentioning <a href="http://www.protopage.com/">Protopage</a> here. Protopage is another service that allows users to place tables filled with user defined links <em>anywhere</em> on a 'web desktop'. However, users must add <em>each link</em> to each table individually, which can be quite laborious...</p>

<p>Whilist still in v1.0 beta, version 2.0 of Protopage does promise support for RSS feeds though...</p>

<p>It's hard to see how Protopage can improve too much on the Netvibes model, though, apart from its 'place a table anywhere' feature. After all, these aren't services where feature overlaod would be too welcome, methinks...</p>

<p>Finally, <a href=-"http://www.memeflow.com/goto/">Memeflow GoTo</a> pages provide a similar offering to Protopage, but in even cruder form. Unlike Netvibes and Protopage, which are both reasonably slick,  the GoTo pages are very crude and don't really offer anything over the other two...<br />

<h3 class="title">Feed Reading in Connotea?</h3>

<p>In a couple of recent posts (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005227.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005088.html">here</a>)  I've posted how the OU Library has started getting into the habit of producing RSS feeds (yippee!:-)</p>

<p>These can readily be integrated into an <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">official</a> or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html"><em>ad hoc</em></a> MyOpenLibrary page.</p>

<p>One question that just came to mind is this: how about being able to consume Library feeds from <em>within</em> <a title="Connotea - a free online reference management service for scientists" href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably know, Connotea is promoting itself as "a free online reference management service for scientists", but it is also admirably suited to providing an educational social bookmarking service, for HE (undergraduate, as well as postgraduate, Higher Education) at least.</p>

<p>One thing that prompted the integration thought is that Connotea <em>already</em> allows users to enter their academic library's <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=news_openurl">OpenURL resolver</a> information to allow for easy access to online academic content that the user's host library subscribes to.</p>

<p>By integrating a user's home library's alerts services (such as new books, and current loans information*) into Connotea, it will be one more stop towards a unified academic reference management tool.</p>

<p>*perhaps seemlessly bookmarking the latter as new books are borrowed, and highlighting the former as possibly worth a browse?</p>

<p>Hmm - I wonder whether Conntoea should be offering a MyOpenLibrary like interface too..?</p>

<p>PS I believe that the OU has just moved away from Athens authentication to letting users who have been authenticated by the OU's single authentication system gain access to Library mediated third party services. This should make accessing electronic resources via bookmarks easier (if the OU authentication cookie is set, of course!), and means there is no need for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003152.html">Athens toolbar</a> like services in any future <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library toolbar</a> (official one coming soon???).</p>

<p>PPS More and more eJournals offefr an RSS feed of contents for latest journal issues - for example, I subscribe to <a href="http://dlib.org/rss/dlib.rss">this one from Dlib</a>. It might be quite useful if I could subscribe to such feeds in Connotea, and copy references to my connotea library from the RSS feed, in much the same way that I can copy other uses' references.</p>

<h3 class="title">More OU Library XML Feeds</h3>

<p>Things are move swiftly in terms of the OU Library's    support for XML feeds - the latest 'beta' is an RSS feed of <a title="Patron Logon" href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=pbLogon">personal loans</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="myLibraryRecord.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myLibraryRecord.JPG" width="551" height="643" border="0" /></p>

<p>I don't think I can publish a URL yet (in part because it contains my Library number in plaintext) but here are a couple examples of it in use.</p>

<p>Firstly, in my <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> page:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesLoans.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesLoans.JPG" width="633" height="530" border="0" /></p>

<p>Secondly, in a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks">Firefox Live Bookmark</a>:</p>

<p>It's easy enough to imagine feeding this information  - along with the Library's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005088.html">new books info</a> - in to a <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a> (or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> page, come to that!).</p>

<p>There's no reason why it couldn't be fed to an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=konfabulator">OU Library Konfabulator widget</a> either...</p>

<h3 class="title">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</h3>

<p>There have been a few posts recently (such as <a title="dave's blog: Creating a Personalized "My Library" page with no sweat" href="http://daweed.blogspot.com/2005/11/creating-personalized-my-library-page.html">dave's blog: Creating a Personalized "My Library" page with no sweat</a>) commenting on how <a href="http://www.netvibes.com"> Netvibes</a> can be used as a MyLibrary style portal.</p>

<p>I've been compiling a 'report' on this in my stolen time, and while it's not finished yet I think it may be appropriate to add a few thoughts to the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>MyOpenLibrary</strong></p>

<p>With the growing number of electronic resources available to OU students, several approaches have been used across OU systems to provide students with semi-customisable links pages, such as the <a href="http://student.open.ac.uk/>student homepage</a> which leads to a personalised page when the user passes through the common authentication service, or the OU Library <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary </a> service.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a> service offers a significant degree of personalisation via a customisable page that allows users to link to electronic resources on particular themes:  E-journals, <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES</a> Links, a Reference Shelf, E-books, Help and Support, Open University Links, Personal Links.</p>

<p><img alt="myOpenLibrary.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myOpenLibrary.jpg" width="490" height="410" border="0" /></p>

<p>(The styling is wayward because the page was designed to take into account the quirks of Internet Explorer, rather than conform to common standards, as used in browsers such as Firefox (shown here) or Opera.)</p>

<p>All the panels offer a link to an about page, and a user customisation page that allows the user to add links to a panel from a set of pre-selected links relevant to the theme of the panel.</p>

<p><em>Search Options</em></p>

<p>In addition, users are able to select a search engine from among a predefined set. For my account, a choice of three search engines were offered as a default: Internet (Google); OU Library catalogue (all items); OU Library catalogue (electronic items).</p>

<p>From the customisation link, users can choose to add additional search engines to their list of options (though not <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo</a> as yet. Rather surprisingly, (for what is presumably in my case a ‘Technology’ default profile), the <a href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk">EEVL</a> search engine was not offered as an option.</p>

<p>The benefits of offering the search option from MyOpenLibrary are arguable for students who typically access the internet from the same browser on the same computer, compared for example with the ability to customise the search engines used from the browser toolbar (or from bespoke, user installed toolbars). Not only must the user open their MyOpenLibrary page in the browser, they must also log in through the OU authentication system to do so.</p>

<p><em>Topic Panels</em></p>

<p>The topic panels provided on the MyOpenLibrary page categorise links according to themes to help the user as they browse the page find the single link they need quickly on a page filled with links. The separate configurability of each panel allows the user willing to invest time in this customisation process to tune the MyOpenLibrary page to suit their own needs. If an expected link is not available as a default in the panel, the customise link takes the user to a page that contains additional related links.</p>

<p>One possible problem with this approach is the stranglehold that the MyOpenLibrary administrators on deciding what links are allowed in what topic panel. Whilst there is obvious value in collating good quality links on individual topics, there is also a lack of flexibility:<ol><li>with respect to adding new links;</li><li>with respect to identifying new topics.</li></ol></p>

<p>When I rediscovered the MyOpenLibrary page (having not visited it for several weeks), I was immediately struck how it would be possible to use the structure of the page as a viewer for tagged bookmarks with each panel displaying links associated with a particular tag or combination of tags.</p>

<p>This approach also suggests how ‘userConfig’ tags might be used to help display links - or not - from a social bookmarking service such as <a href="http://www.connotea.org">Connotea</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> marked with a particular tag.</p>

<p>Most social bookmarking services provide an RSS feed of links corresponding to one or more particular users, tags, or any combination thereof. For example:</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/psychemedia/livelinks?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon"></script><br />
<noscript><a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/livelinks">my del.icio.us</a></noscript></p>

<p>(The above livelinks could easily have been styled in a MyOpenLibrary like table - just no time at the moment!)</p>

<p>Now, imagine I have three bookmarks tagged as ‘library’ but only want to display two of them (although I do want them all bookmarked. The setting of user preferences as to which of a set of relevant links are displayed now becomes as simple as adding a ‘MOL:display’ tag, for example, and then displaying links tagged as <em>library+MOL:display</em></p>

<p>If the user does not want a link they have tagged as ‘library’ displayed, then all they have to do is remove the MOL:display tag. Note that this could be done seamlessly via a bookmarklet (‘remove’ this link, for example).</p>

<p>Just as a list of relevant links for a topic were made available via the customisation pages, so a similar approach may be made in a social bookmarking scheme, where for example links associated with a particular tag are listed along with a bookmarklet to add the link to the student’s bookmark list and set the MOL:display tag.</p>

<p>In a social bookmarking system, note that related links may be displayed in panels that identify the provenance of a link – for example, whether it was suggested by the library,  the course team for a particular course, from ROUTEs, one or more students, or academics, and so on. So by introducing a general bookmarking system – and in particular a social bookmarking system – we are able to go from MyOpenLibrary to OUrOpenLibrary…</p>

<p>It is also possible to identify which tags should be used as the basis for display panels. For example, imagine bookmarking the RSS feed for a particular tag (or tag combination) for a particular user and tagging it as MOL:displayPanel. A server script based on the following pseudo-code could then render the appropriate panels:</p>

<p>For each tag feed tagged with MOL:displayPanel:<br />
 - Create Panel<br />
 - Add Panel Title<br />
 - For each link in tag feed<br />
 - - Render Link</p>

<p><strong>‘Free’ Customisable Links Pages on the Web.</strong></p>

<p>One extreme form of customisable links ‘page’ corresponds to a users personal page within a social bookmarking system. There are many examples of social bookmarking services available, but I shall concentrate on del.icio.us as it is, at the time of writing, one of the most popular – and well used – services. </p>

<p>The simple styling of the del.icio.us interface, which has been copied in part by several other social bookmarking schemes, provides a straightforward list of bookmarks, ordered by time, with the most recent bookmark at the top of the first page. A tag selection panel allows the user to view the links associated with a particular tag, or combination of tags.</p>

<p>As it stands, the del.icio.us interface does not allow the user to configure a number of panels, cf. the MyOpenLibrary interface, with each panel containing links for a corresponding tag, for example. A MyOpenLibrary style interface could be implemented using scripts that pull the RSS feed for particular (combinations of) tags into distinct panels using an RSS to javascript service, or server based RSS display script, to give a similar layout to the MyOpenLibrary interface. However, as it stands, the multiple, almost concurrent requests that would be made to del.icio.us whenever the page is loaded would (I think) contravene the del.icio.us user API guildelines (too many requests in a short period of time) and consequently some of the requests may be denied by del.icio.us.</p>

<p><strong>Using Netvibes as a public MyOpenLibrary Equivalent</strong></p>

<p>A recently launched service – <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> – allows users to configure any number of user created panels with any number of links. If the user always accesses the page from the same browser (e.g. always from the same machine ??or from a portable browser on a USB memory stick, for example) then the user’s customised page is displayed whenever the user visits the site. More general access to the user’s customised page is guaranteed by creating an account on the system and customising the page when logged in.</p>

<p><img alt="netvibes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibes.jpg" width="472" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p>Recent customisable, personal page services announced by <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google</a> and <a href="http:/live.com">Microsoft</a> can also be used to display links provided as RSS feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="google_ig.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/google_ig.jpg" width="472" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p><strong>A Way Forward for the OU?</strong></p>

<p>When considering the design of a links page, there are several factors that need to be taken into account:<br />
<ul><li>Aesthetics/page design</li><br />
<li>Degree of customisation</li><br />
<li>Provision of ‘seed’ links</li><br />
<li>Recommendations for additional customised links</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>It is also worth considering the separation of link tables (that is, the collection of links displayed in a particular panel as a distinct set of links) and their presentation, particularly insofar as other systems might be used display any link table independently of the others.</p>

<p>For example, one might imagine a MyOpenLibrary-like display acting as a link aggregator, with different panels containing links relevant to different courses. The course related link tables that provide content for each of the display panels might also be used to feed a single panel in a course specific page.</p>

<h3 class="title">Seven Ways of Using Social Bookmarking</h3>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I offered to run a workshop on social bookmarking in April next year at what used to be known in the OU as TTAA (Tracking Technology for Academic advantage).</p>

<p>The event has since been renamed as the <a href=""http://kn.open.ac.uk/workspace.cfm?wpid=4589">Learning and Teaching Conference</a>, which is a shame, because I'd always wanted to do something at TTAA. (For those of you who can't see that page, <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/index.cfm?wpid=3816">here's an example</a> of the sort of thing that goes on...)</p>

<p>Anyway, here's what I offered to do - a 45 minute long workshop on:</p>

<p><strong><em>Seven ways of using social bookmarks...</strong><br />
Social bookmarking systems are web-based services that allow users to bookmark all manner of web based resources, 'tag' those resources with meaningful keywords, and share their bookmarks with others. In this workshop, we'll look at how to use social bookmarking systems, how to discover resources bookmarked by others, and how to use RSS to pull links to bookmarked resources into arbitrary web pages. As for the rest of the 7 claimed uses? You'll just have to turn up and see.</em></p>

<p>Now, as I haven't yet managed to use social bookmarking in a course formally. (yet), but hope to try out a few things before the workshop, it's quite possible that the 7 things I can think of now will have changed by then. So I thought it would be interesting to start preparing for the workshop now (rather than the evening before the event, as is more usual;-) by jotting down some possible candidates for the 7 things...</p>

<p>Oh - one last thing to note before the list - the theme of the conference will be "Learning and Teaching - On the Move".</p>

<p><strong>(More Than) Seven Things You Can Do With Social Bookmarking - Candidate Features</strong><ol><li>Save and access <em>personal</em> bookmarks to electronic resources via a web browser (good start, eh? "personal" bookmarks!);</li><li>Classify/categorise/index bookmarks with user-defined <em>tags</em>;</li><li>Share bookmarks publicly, or with members of a particular group.</li><li>Research - identify other users with similar interests, identify resources tagged similarly to your resources;</li><li>See how popular a resource is by seeing how many other people have bookmarked it (e.g. <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/03/who-rates-this-page.html">here</a>);</li><li>Syndicate resource links via RSS;</li><li>Rapid publishing (e.g. similar to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004638.html">here</a> - the main idea being you can feed description info into the page, too);</li><li><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=%22live+links%22">LiveLinks</a></li><li>Feed services such as <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/demo/">MyOpenLibrary</a></li><li>Socialise <a href="http://routes.olpen.ac.uk">ROUTES</a> (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=%22social+routes%22">along these lines</a>).</li></ol></p>

<p>And there was me thinking I'd run out before the seven...</p>

<p>PS for an institutional audience, this consideration of a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">Managed Social Bookmarking Environment in Higher Education</a> may also be relevant...</p>

<h3 class="title">Unintended Learning</h3>

<p>To what extent should we require learners to learn what we want them to learn, rather than what they think they want to learn?</p>

<p>For example, the following quote comes from the article <a href="http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/2678">Teachers are wary about using IT in the classroom</a> that I spotted some time ago on an eGov newswire:</p>

<p><em>Some young people became distracted and used the internet to learn things their teachers hadn't intended. The report says that effective teaching and learning with ICT involves finding ways of building bridges between 'idiosyncratic' and 'intended' learning.</em></p>

<p>My immediate thought was: if we're skilling people to be lifelong learners, shouldn't we find ways of exploiting idiosyncratic (learner motivated?) learning?</p>

<p>I can see the obvious tension within a system builit around tightly specified curricula and learning outcomes, but these approaches are implicitly based on a model in which the omniscient educator is able to clearly identify the fact stuff that a student should learn for some reason (I'm often unsure as to what that reason is, though!)</p>

<p>Anyway - when I originally posted the above on a departmental confernce, I got the following comment from David Chapman, another academic in the department:</p>

<p>"Don't worry, though, one day it will be included as a specified learning outcome:</p>

<p>"Knowledge and Understanding<br />
.....<br />
17: 	Learn at least three things you were not intended to learn"</p>

<p>Hmm - shouldn't that be a <em>Practical Skill</em>? ;-)</p>

<p>NB the origins of this post are interesting - I needed a footnote, or aside,  in <em>another post</em> (see <strong>Trackback</strong> below for details), and this seemed the most sensible way of providing it).</p>

<h3 class="title">Towards a Managed Social Bookmarking Environment in Higher Education</h3>

<p>As followers of this blog will know, one of the topics I keep doodling about is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=education+social+bookmark">social bookmarking in an academic context</a>. In this post, I want to start considering how we might use such tools at scale in a managed environment.</p>

<p>A couple of services promote themselves as being directed towards educational users (I'm thinking of <a title="Scuttledu - Online Bookmarks Manager for Educators" href="http://blogs.zanestate.edu/mybookmarks/">Scuttledu - Online Bookmarks Manager for Educators</a> and <a href="http://connotea.org/">Connotea</a> in particular) but at the moment their focus appears to be on recruiting individual users, rather than offering a 'solution' at a cohort or even institutional level.</p>

<p>So  - let's get to it: a first stab at identifying some of the issues that are likely to arise when considering how to integrate a social bookmarking system into a managed, institutionally administered, loosely coupled VLE. The sort of environment where it falls to sysadmin to says who's allowed where, and possibly also who can say what.</p>

<p>Just to ground my thoughts, I shall assume that the system we're going to adopt will be something based on Connotea, in part because the code for an early version at least has been released under an open content license (you can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/connotea">download the Connotea source code from Sourceforge</a>).</p>

<p>To provide even more context, let's assume that we're might want to use the social bookmarking within an institution in the following ways (this list is not necessarily complete):</p>

<ol><li>By registering all the students on a particular course to the system so they can use it in course related exercises;</li>
<li>By registering every student who joins the institution so they can use it as a resource throughout their registration period, and even beyond (i.e. when they graduate);</li>
<li>To allow the system to integrate with pre-existing authentication systems;</li>
<li>To allow students to share knowledge between cohorts (e.g. so one year's coohrt can leave a legacy to the next cohort);</li>
<li>To provide an environment where student project teams or tutor groups can share bookmarks and comments privately amongst themselves;</li>
<li>To provide a bookmarking component in an e-portfolio system;</li>
<li>To maintain a needs-serving link with graduates/alumni by continuing to host their bookmarks (perhaps supporting this service by advertising relevant courses or fundraising initiatives to such alumni at a future date;-);</li></ol>

<p>Additional constraints may arise as a result of working with particular cohorts, such as minors or vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that there is a requirement to ensure that all bookmarks are moderated. Let us assume that there are several possible levels of moderation:<br />
<ul><li><em>strong moderation</em>, by which we mean that a moderator must approve every link before <em>anyone</em> can click-thru it (including the person who saved the bookmark);</li><br />
<li><em>intermediate moderation</em>, in which a user may follow their own bookmarks but a moderator must approve them before they can be shared; and</li><br />
<li><em>weak moderation</em>, whereby bookmarks may be shared within a group but must be approved by a moderator before they can be made public.</li><br />
<li><em>no moderation</em> - users are free to bookmark what they like and may choose whether to keep it private, share it with one or more groups, or make it public.</li></ul></p>

<p>Taking Connotea as an example, how might we implement these various levels of moderation?</p>

<p>In the first case - <em>strong moderation</em> - all bookmarks could be held in an 'awaiting approval table', which contains all the fields used to store a bookmark, plus the user's ID and a moderation approval state flag. When a moderator approves the message, the 'approved' flag is set and the bookmark can be saved to the user's bookmark list.</p>

<p>In the second case - <em>intermediate moderation</em> - the bookmark would be saved to the user's bookmark list as a private bookmark AND a lock would be placed on the bookmark preventing the user from sharing it (this could be managed within a 'lock this bookmark' table recording the user and bookmark ID, and the lock state). If the user attempted to share the bookmark, the system would first heck the 'bookmark lock' table to see if the bookmark had been opened up by the moderator for sharing. In terms of usability, it would be courteous to inform the user when a bookmark had been enabled for sharing, or even automatically share it as soon as received approval if that preference had been previously expressed by the user.</p>

<p>In the third and final case - <em>weak moderation</em> - the lock state within a lock table may be used to characterise the level of locking applied. For example, one might imagine being able to lock the shareability of the bookmark to the extent that it was <em>locked against</em> public sharing, <em>locked against</em> sharing with one or more specified groups, or <em>opened up</em> to sharing with particular groups (and by implication locked against sharing with all other groups).</p>

<p>There may also be a place for an <em>enforced privacy</em> regime in which users are not allowed to share bookmarks with each other at all, <em>ever</em>, yet still require strong moderation. A 'bookmark lock' table would be enough to support this facility.</p>

<p>A weaker view might enforce <em>restricted sharing</em> in which the user was only allowed to share bokmarks with several groups. Once again, a 'bookmark lock' table with lock states set for each group ('shareable', 'shareable when approved', 'not shareable') should be enough to support this facility.</p>

<p>For completeness, we may also want to consider the extent to which comments may be shared. The simplest assumption, of course, is that comments and links share the same sharing privileges, but this is not necessarily so. For example, there may be occasions in which you want users to share links, <em>but</em> keep their comments private, perhaps until some embargo date.</p>

<p>How would students use such a system, and what sort of sharing should be encouraged (for example, should we have global public sharing, sharing within cohorts but not across years, sharing within tutor groups but not between tutor groups and so on)? Allied to this are questions relating to providing users with default tags to tag resources (i.e. tags which are automatically applied depending on student context).</p>

<p>Scuttledu takes the approach of automatically tagging resources with a grade level identified from a user's personal profile. It's easy to see how such a technique could be used for a student on a particular course, but problems arise if a student is registered on more than one course at a particular time.</p>

<p>Another approach may be to follow services such as <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> which offer recommended tags to a user whenever they bookmark a resource.</p>

<p>The provision of separate bookmarks for a student to bookmark resources with different default tags (e.g. different bookmarks for each course, or for just personal use) is another possible strategy. (I'm not yet clear how much further this could be taken by embedding bookmarking tools in a browser, for example as <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> has done.</p>

<p>Finally, I guess I should also say <em>why</em> we might want to run a social bookmarking system in such a managed, or controlled way? Some of the reasons that come to mind (mostly as a result of my uninformed, stereotyped view of central computing services and beancounter' views in general!) are as follows:<br />
<ul><li>social bookmarking could become a value-adding service, the reliable provision of which forms part of the institution's contract with the student; as such, liveness and reliability need to be guaranteed; uniformity of provision (and a guaranteed high quality of provision) to students</li><br />
<li>if social bookmarking is to be introduced as part of the learning strategy, some would argue that its use needs to be carefully managed to ensure that it is capable of delivering whatever the learning designer requires; (unfortunately, this approach reminds somewhat of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005115.html">unintended learning as a <em>bad</em> thing</a>);</li><br />
<li>integration with other cohort related batch processes (e.g. registering all new students, or setting particular group privileges for a particular cohort);</li><br />
<li>Educational establishments need to be wary of what gets published on their domains. List of links to adult resources, for example, are unlikely to be tolerated.</li></ul></p>

<p>It will fall to another post for me to reflect a bit on the contents of the lists braindumped above...</p>

<h3 class="title">Playing With the ROUTES-XML Feed - Getting There</h3>

<p>I mentioned in <a title="OUseful Info: Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost..." href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004853.html">OUseful Info: Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost...</a> a quick demo looking at how to consume a ROUTES-XML feed, but all it used was a static, test page to deliver results.</p>

<p>However, I couldn't resist having another quick play and making use of the service for real, so here's <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/OUsefulROUTES.html">a more complete demo</a>.</p>

<p>It's very ropey of course, and the form doesn't work properly, but it's not supposed to be much more than a minimal proof-of-concept prototype for my own education.</p>

<p>I haven't tested the script properly of course, so it may get taken down at any point... <br />
