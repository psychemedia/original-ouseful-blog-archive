<h3 class="title">Facebook Now Offering App Stats, of a Sort...</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the ways I've been keeping tabs on the level activity around the Course Profiles Facebook app has been to check the app's developers page, which until today has reported the number of users and also displayed the last few http request stats...</p>

<p>...but looking just now, I notice a few more reports have been made available. For example, here's a report on the number of daily active users over the last couple of weeks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218849371/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2043/2218849371_43b1b4cb4c.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2218" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="435" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>There are several other weekly reports being made available too:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2219643668/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2071/2219643668_b5c58ba285.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2219" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="294" width="308" /></a></p>

<p>The unique canvas page views graph broadly follows the daily activie users, but the people who visit do seem to have multiple views of the canvas page, so maybe they are visiting several times a day?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218856813/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2218856813_e417071b86.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2222" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="312" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The HTTP Requests tab gives a listing of the most recent HTTP requests, a report that always was made available. Howver, a better way of analysing that information is via Google Analytics, which we've been running for some time (although we only added goal tracking a couple of days ago).</p>

<p>For example, here are the most popular 'pages' over the last month:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2218863443/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2218863443_11374f9b9f.jpg" alt="2008-01-25_2226" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="275" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In the case of B201, for example, the course comment wall has become a meeting place for students about to start on the course. The "official" OU course forums open a week before the start of the course, I think, but these students are obviously keen to meet up and chat before then. The study buddy page for that course has also seen quite a bit of activity, so it'll be interesting to find out whether any 'friends' have actually been made using that facility.</p>

<p>Looking further down the results listing (not shown ;-), there appear to be quite a few active course comment and study buddy pages, particularly for level 1 courses, which tend to have a larger population than higher level courses. At least one masters level course is also showing study buddy activity too, which is interesting.</p>

<p>So... I need to start asking myself a couple of things...</p>

<p>Firstly, I wonder what the best way is of reconciling data about users' course declarations (taken anonymously from the app database) and the Google Analytics data? There is a limited export function from GA, so I can get a dump of active pages, for example, then see how well the activity correlates to user declarations. But I'm not sure how useful that would be? Certainly I want to find some sort of course reporting format that I can show to any interested course teams, but what sort of information would it be useful for them to know? And why?</p>

<p>The second major question is privacy - should I even be considering offering course teams reports about usage of course related activity within the Facebook app? And how far can I go reporting the activity in general on this public blog, so you, my dear readers ;-), can see what sorts of reports are becoming available? (Maybe if I show real reports, but obfuscate the course codes, it would be okay?)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20profiles" rel="tag">course profiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20google%20analytics" rel="tag"> google analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20googalytics" rel="tag"> googalytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20web%20analytics" rel="tag"> web analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20webalytics" rel="tag"> webalytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20user%20stats" rel="tag"> user stats</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Course Analytics, Part 2 - When Are Our Students Online?</h3>

<!--
<p>[<a href="#updateCAWhen">UPDATED</a> - with a whole load of qualifying statements and disclaimers!]</p>

<p>Google Analytics offers a couple of views of the same report that might be useful in identifying study patterns - the <em>Visitor trending - Visits</em> report.</p>

<p>(Note these reports are captured over slightly less than the 8 week period mentioned in the previous post.)</p>

<p><h3>Visits - By Date</h3><em>Visits - By Date</em> breaks down the number of visits by date over a particular period. The following snapshot suggests some sort of periodicity as well as "quiet days" during the week - Saturdays, for example, appear <em>not</em> to be popular study days for this cohort, whereas by observation Sunday, Monday and Tuesday are.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/1751654650_1f4752031f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="411" width="500" /></p>

<p>A more rigorous test would be to run this time series data through an autocorrelation function, or some form of spectral analysis, for example, to see whether it is "really" periodic. (But this is a quick blog post, not a formal paper, so here is not the place to run that sort of test... unless anyone knows of a quick'n'easy online tool I can paste my GA data into and get such a report out?)</p>

<p>That said - the report needs to be taken with a pinch of salt (also see <a href="#updateCAWhen">[update]</a> below...). I mentioned in the previous post that the number of unique visitors significantly outnumbers the number of students registered on the course (i.e. the number of people who have access to the course materials): that is, there is a many-to-one mapping from Google unique visitors to students. <em>It's also worth remembering that the course in question requires at least as much study time again on book reading and desktop computer activity...</em></p>

<p>A consideration of data across the whole length of the course also suggests that the periodicity is not so clear cut. There is also a clear "end effect" around the time of the end-of-course assessment, as I will show in the next post on this topic.<br />
<h3>Visits - By Time of Day</h3>Having got a handle (maybe) on what days of the week our students are going online, the next question to ask is what time of day students are logging in to the course materials.</p>

<p><em>Visits - By Time of Day</em> gives just such a report (my analytics settings are set to UK time, so the following should be the "real" time of access for our UK students. (A map overlay (not show) shows that virtually all the students on the course were coming form UK IP addresses.)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2391/1750804869_3433142057.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="430" /></p>

<p>The distribution suggests that&nbsp; we don't have so many night owls, nor a significant number of students studying early in the morning (before work or getting the kids ready for school, for example). Peaks around lunchtime might suggest online study at work (or there again, they might not...), with another bump in the evening between 7pm and 10pm.</p>

<p>A finer grained breakdown, e.g. giving time of day reports for weekdays, Saturday and Sunday, would help to unmask any differences between weekend (i.e. Sunday!) working compared to weekday working.<br />
<h3>Summary</h3>Identfying exactly <em>when</em> distance educations students engage with their studies is always problematic for distance education institutions. The move to online delivery and online study through a controlled website makes it possible to capture this information invisibly, without requiring students to self-complete and return study logs.</p>

<p>Two views of a single Google Analytics report - the Visitor Trending "Visitors" report - allow us to identify study patterns across time of day, and day of week.</p>

<p>Visual observation of reports collected over a two week period hint at patterns of behaviour across the week, with Sunday, Monday and Tuesday being popular study days, and Saturday being unpopular; and throughout the day - lunchtimes and early evening are popular, all night and early morning study unlikely.</p>

<p>[<a name="updateCAWhen">UPDATE</a>: The "Saturday effect" may be completely misleading insofar as it describes how students study the <em>whole</em> of the course... I mentioned that the course includes book reading and use of a desktop application, which are being studied - somewhen; the analytics reported here therefore only relate to the online portion of the course, which correspond to maybe 40% of the time spent on the course... oops... I'll try to focus more on what is maybe safer ground in future posts, and concentrate on what the analytics appears to tell us about <em>just</em> the way the students appear to be interacting with the <em>online</em> materials, at least, without worrying too much about those uncounted students who didn't just print the materials off and study them that way!)]</p>

<p><small>"Confession": maybe not publishing in peer reviewed circles for a bit has led to me losing some of the rigour of academic analysis? A couple of times I've been tempted to write: "-maybe, this is only a blog post after all and not a proper academic publication....", as if that let's me off... Hmm... I wonder how this sits with Martin's thoughts on <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/10/academic-discou.html">Academic Discourse and [Blogging]</a>? Certainly, Grainne Conole's excellent new <a href="http://e4innovation.com/">e4innovation</a> blog is something I would say does tend towards "formal" academic credibility (references 'n' everything ;-)</small><br />

<!--
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">Course Analytics - Prequel</a> I set the scene for a couple of posts about student behaviour in an online course, as viewed through a <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> lens.</p>

<p>To clarify things a little further before I start, I'm not really interested at this stage in reporting course grades or identifying individual students who maybe about to drop out, or need some sort of additional support, (although outlier data points may points towards the existence of such individuals). In short I'm not really interested in <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/library/abstract/AcademicAnalytics/45275">Academic Analytics</a>.</p>

<p>For the moment, what I am interested in is how website analytics can be used applied to online course websites in order to gain a better understanding of online study habits and the bahaviour of students taking an online course.</p>

<p>The potential disconnect between this view of <em>online-course analytics</em> and <em>academic analytics</em> is something I may explore later - just not here, and not yet... (That said, finding ways of correlating/reconciling online-course and academic analytics (to create a fusion "elearning analytics"?!) to gain a more comprehensive view of individual performance on the one hand, and course performance in all its senses on the other, would I'm sure be an interesting exercise.)</p>

<p>One final disclaimer - the data shown here is partial data collected as a pilot exercise over the last 8 weeks or so from 10 week, online course, in the context of no other web stats reports.</p>

<p>The course is split into 10 one-week sessions, with assessment in weeks 5 and week 10. The online study materials amount to a nominal 2 to 4 hours of study per week (the course also includes reading from two supplied set books, and completing a series of practical activities using a desktop application, for which instructional material is provided via a set of downloadbale PDF documents and a desktop application launcher.</p>

<p>The intention of the exercise was to gain familiarity of Google Analytics in a familiar context, and identify meaningful course analytics that could inform a course analytics reporting strategy for future presentations of the course, and help identify appropriate conversion "goals" for a course website.</p>

<p>In this post I shall describe several reports relating to general visitor behaviour. In further posts I'll show reports on daily behaviour/weekly cycles, as well as activity surrounding assessment submission dates and user search behaviour from within the course materials.</p>

<p>Data that was not collected includes  - printing behaviour (whether students printed out copies of the online course materials) and outlink click-thru behaviour (whether students followed links to external web resources.</p>

<p>Unique visitors are identified by Google Analytics alone; that is, although individual students logged in to the course using their own credentials, those credentials - or the individual students' login identities - played no part in the collection of the analytics data. As such, we would expect the number of unique visitors over the period to be in excess of the number of students registered on the course if students access the course materials from more than one browser configuration.</p>

<p><h3>Visitor Loyalty</h3>The <em>Visitor Loyalty</em> report describes how often each visitor accessed the course materials over the 8 week data collection period.</p>

<p>The absolute number of unique visitors (not shown) is way in excess of the number of students registered on the course, so this report must be taken with a pinch of salt (the actual number of logins per student over the course period should be obtainable from "offiical" learning system reporting tools).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/1745710516_85396eda43.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="481" width="490" /></p>

<p>The report would seem to indicate that students are accessing the site multiple times (at least 50% of them more than 10 times).</p>

<p>(I actually find the above report confusing - does it read: "Of N visits, the visitors who made those visits visited Number-of-Visits times"? If so, the Number-of-Visits has dimensions "visits per visitor", in which case isn't the Visits divided by the Number-of-Visits the Number-of-Visitors, which should be an integer value?!)</p>

<p><h3>Length of Visit</h3>The <em>Length of Visit</em> report describes the amount of time a visitor spent on the site in a particular session. I would hazard a guess that computers left switched on, mid-session, overnight would report a long length of visit.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2008/1744858419_4b28b1da14.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="306" width="500" /></p>

<p>The distribution suggests that the majority of students are logging in for more than 5 minutes at a time, with a significant proportion spending at least, of the order of, half an hour online.</p>

<p>The granularity of reporting is obviously geared to sites where long sessions are atypical. I need to check whether I can get better resolution data for longer durations/lengths of visit.</p>

<p><h3>Depth of Visit</h3>The <em>Depth of Visit</em> report shows how many pages a visitor accessed on each visit. As with the <em>Length of Visit</em> report, short visits are not so interesting (except insofar as we might wonder what a visitor is doing on a short a visit?!)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/1744857941_44a0d522b2.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="346" /></p>

<p>What is far more interesting is the long tail, and the significant percentage of visits in which students are engaged with the online course materials for a long period of time. As a guide, each week's study is approximately 20 HTML pages of material, accessed from the course index page or course calendar.</p>

<p>Once again, the low resolution reporting for "deep" visits means it works against us, although it is tempting to draw the conclusion that some students might study the week's material in a single session.</p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>The above reports suggest that a significant proportion of students spend a significant amount of time studying the online materials. As a heuristic, designing materials in "chunks" that can be studied within a 30 minute online study session would seem to be reasonable.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/analytics" rel="tag">analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20analytics" rel="tag">course analytics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=42132">Stephen Downes</a> picked up on an <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB6101.pdf">EduCause report on <em>Academic Analytics</em></a>, which "describes how data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling". Academic Analytics can also be used to predict student success, as well as retention.</p>

<p>In this post, I thought I'd set the scene for a series of <em>course analytics</em> posts using data that I "acquired" from an online course earlier this year. (I've posted previously about some of my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog/010481.html">early thinking on the topic</a>.)</p>

<p>In contrast to the academic analytics, one of the things I set out to explore was how an off the shelf web stats analytics tool (<a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>) could be used to help me learn more about what students were doing with our online course materials, and help me identify what - if anything - a "learning site's" <em>goals</em> could be, and what the site might be optimised for.</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty lies with the site not being a "selling" site. Optimising a mini-site like <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?A02">Study at the OU</a> is in the first instance all about securing registrations on courses. But for an online course, it's not so clear what the goal is, or what the important metrics along the way are.</p>

<p>(I asked a similar question at the Library Strategy workshop a couple of weeks ago: if the library website was Amazon, then success would be measured in taking someone's credit card number, shipping the goods, and not getting them returned. What's the success measure - or success measures - for a library website?)</p>

<p>Something I found useful in helping me think about this topic was this seminar on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgXDUuAK77M">Google Analytics - Non-Ecommerce Sites: Beyond Averages</a> from the <a href="Google%20Conversion%20University">Google Conversion University Playlist on YouTube</a> (the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/conversionuniversity.html">Google Conversion University website</a> also has some interesting articles...).</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LgXDUuAK77M"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LgXDUuAK77M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>In particular, here are four <em>distribution</em> (rather than average) measures that are useful for analysing user behaviour on non-ecommerce websites:<br />
<ul><li>Visitor loyalty - how often has each user visited the site over a given period;</li><br />
<li>Visitor recency - of all the people who have visited the site, how many have visited in the last N days;</li><br />
<li>Length of visit - how long do visitors stay on site;</li><br />
<li>Depth of visit - how many pages on the site are seen on each visit;</li></ul></p>

<p>Over the next week or so, I'll do a series of posts looking at these measures as obtained from an online course, and go way beyond reports like this...</p>

<p>That said - there are a couple of interesting features in the above report - periodicity, for example (Tuesday's look busy...), and traffic peaks at the two assessment weeks...</p>

<p><small>PS Just by the by, if you use consultants to do your reading for you (i.e. you read through reports or sit through presentations that talk-up <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause-Great/dp/0875845851/?tag=ouseful-21">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustaining-Successful/dp/1578518520/?tag=ouseful-21">Solution</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190/?tag=ouseful-21">Blue Ocean Strategies</a> and so on) I'm guessing that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Competing-Analytics-Thomas-H-Davenport/dp/1422103323/?tag=ouseful-21">Competing on Analytics</a> will be the next "bestselling" Harvard Business School book they quote at you! (I'm not convinced that the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/0713999950/?tag=ouseful-21">Black Swan</a> will fly? ;-)</small><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20analytics" rel="tag">course analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20online%20learning" rel="tag"> online learning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/elearning" rel="tag">elearning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/analytics" rel="tag">analytics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
