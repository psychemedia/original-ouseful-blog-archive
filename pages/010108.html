<h3 class="title">The Future of Music</h3>

<p>Old news now in the blogosphere - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6516189.stm">EMI lets go of DRM on iTunes</a> (a good summary - and links to the press releases - <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/emi_music_drm_free.php">here</a>) - but a useful hook for this post - who's interested in MP3 downloads when you can recompile the source?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nin.com/current/">NIN</a> (that's Nine Inch Nails) look set to release <em>all</em> the tracks on their forthcoming album as <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> 'source' files; </p>

<p><img alt="ninRemix.png" src="./ninRemix.png" width="618" height="237" border="0" /></p>

<p>NIN have actually been doing this with <a href="http://www.nin.com/downloads/index.html">one-off tracks</a> for a couple of years, and encouraging remixers to upload their mixes as part of a remix competition. In addition to Garageband files, releases have also been made for other audio mixing software.</p>

<p>A slightly different approach is taken by <a href="http://www.u-myx.com/">U-Myx</a> who require users to use the U-Myx software - and pay for the downloads.</p>

<p>But for a similar result - the user gets to play... ;-)</p>

<p>This approach is something I have dreamed of over the last 15 years as wouldn't-it-be-good-if idles, and anticipated eagerly more recently. My expectation over the last 5 years or so was that CD singles/albums would start to include remix applications/software studios on that medium - but I've been tracking it as a download reality on and off for the last 6 months or so (though it's been happening for longer).</p>

<p>That said - my expectation of getting the 'src' on the CD was predicated on the supply of the remix application on the CD too, rather than it being pre-installed on the users' computer.</p>

<p>The next thing I'm looking out for is a 'live by machine' gig, where a club franchise has real hardware/synths being played <em>at a distance</em> by the band, who are maybe in another venue owned by that club chain?</p>

<p>For this, you have to imagine banks of synths receiving (MIDI) control signals over the net from the <em>real</em> musicians playing live elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is not so much <a href="http://www.ninjam.com/index.php">online jamming</a> (or here: <a href="http://www.ejamming.com/">eJamming</a>) - where you mix realtime audio feeds from other musicians on the web with your own efforts - as real time creation of the music from audio generators...</p>

<p>.. a bit like the way audio in games works today, and how <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/news/view.php?id=2419">MIDI created audio in computer games</a> is going.</p>

<p>And the next step after that?</p>

<p>Well, you won't be downloading MP3. Instead I'm looking forward to a time when we'll be downloading a Garageband-like mix to our Garageband-like stereos - its audio card will generate sounds using onboard synths and samplers and do a real time audio mix for you.</p>

<p>So if you like to tinker with a graphic equaliser on your current stereo, the Garageband-like remix player is gonna be a whole load of fun... ;-)</p>
