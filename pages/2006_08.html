<!--
<p>Picked up from Jim Ellis' monthly Interactive Media Newsletter is the news that Moodle will be using the Yahoo User Interface (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>) toolkit as the 'official' Moodle Ajax tookit. </p>

<p>(For a demo of what the YUI supports, see <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/javascript/15-things-you-can-do-with-yahoo-uiprint/">15 Things you can do with Yahoo! UI</a>; for reference, see the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/06/02/yui-utilities-cheat-sheets/">YUI cheatsheets</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder if this means that OU online course materials delivered through the Moodle environment will also be "allowed" to make use of YUI functionality? If so, I wonder what the repercussions are for the OU online course materials XML schema (we are supposed to be moving towards an XML workflow...) More on this in a later post, (which may end up on the NOUS blog, depending how contentious it is ;-)</p>

<p>More OU news - there are a couple of posts being advertised over in IET:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2483&ref=ext">Senior Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: Your key role will be lead programmer and developer for institutional and externally funded IT projects. You will focus on several concurrent projects, including working with national and international partners developing tools such as a Learning Design player, mentoring and student support system, online surveying, eLearning support and knowledge management services. <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/pp/a.little/index.cfm?page=ld">Alex Little</a> was blogging odd bits about the learning design player, I think, and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/">Martin Weller</a> has also <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/08/learning_design.html">blogged about LAMS in an OU context</a>.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2491&ref=ext">Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: The key role of this position is to carry out software and web development for a variety of externally-funded educational technology projects. Past projects have included knowledge management tools, a learning design player and new feature development for the open-source virtual learning environment Moodle. There is a growing interest in social software in the Institute and it is possible some projects may be in this area.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2487&ref=ext"> Two Learning and Teaching Development Officers, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: We are expanding the Learning and Teaching Development Team which works across the Institute and the University to provide support for the University's learning and teaching strategies. The team are involved in cutting-edge projects, including: evaluating new course material for Open University students; getting to grips with the challenges of student retention; exploring innovative methods of online assessment; working with academics to explore best usability practice in teaching.</li></ul></p>

<p>If you go for any of these posts, please mention that you saw it advertised on the OUseful blog...</p>

<p>... or don't ... (blog post reading wastrels, pah!;-)</p>

<p>Hmm - what else is new...? Ah yes, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/">this</a> caught my eye (after a pointer from <a href="http://www.jvvw.com/index.php">Juliet</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="courseReviewDown.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseReviewDown.jpg" width="511" height="192" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's also put paid (temporarily, I hope) to the reviews that were fed through to course pages on the the course catalogue. If you can't remember what they looked like, I (thankfully) took a few screenshots for an earlier post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">reviewing the OU course catalogue web pages</a>.</p>

<p>Juliet's observation also sensitised me to this post (obtained via <a href="http://downes.ca">Downes</a>) critiquing: <a href="http://www.pebbleroad.com/article/the_changing_face_of_university_websites/">The Changing Face of University Websites</a>.</p>

<p>And as I'm on the topic, for readers with SAMS access, check out <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">Guy Carberry's blog</a> on design matters relating to OU materials (both print and web-based)... it's good stuff...</p>

<p>Reported widely (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5292168.stm">this from the BBC</a> is typical, and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192300431">this from Information Week</a> analyses the move in relation to Microsoft Live), Google are now hosting office like services for businesses: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/a/">Google Apps for Your Domain</a> (Gmail, Talk, Calendar and Page Creator at the mo, but presumably more to follow?).</p>

<p>And the offering is not just apps for businessy businesses, at that:</p>

<p><img alt="gEdApps.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gEdApps.jpg" width="214" height="164" border="0" /></p>

<p>As you might expect, the Google monster has trundled on from from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">Outsourcing Email in Higher Education</a> to providing the whole range of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/a/edu/">Google Apps for Education</a> ...</p>

<p>Another interesting announcement that happened while I was away on holiday (darn it - I got an invite, but the beta is now closed...) was for Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ec2">Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>... a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.</p>

<p>Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) enables storage in the cloud, Amazon EC2 enables "compute" in the cloud. Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment.</blockquote><br />
(For a quick review, here's the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/24/exclusive-amazon-readies-utility-computing-service/">Techcrunch take on EC2</a>.)</p>

<p>Sun have been offering this sort of service with the <a href="http://www.sun.com/service/sungrid/overview.jsp">Sun Grid Compute Utility</a> for some time, but Amazon's move is another step towards providing a complete set of web app backend services.</p>

<h3 class="title">Two More Library Related Greasemonkey Scripts</h3>

<!--
<p>So the midnight oil has run out and the last for entries to MUTL looms, so here's a couple more scripts that didn't get as far as I wanted, but that do work, after a fashion... </p>

<p>The rationale for offering two scripts up together is that they demonstrate different potential uses for making use of a Greasemonkey script (or Firefox extension derived from a Greasemonkey script using a script2extension converter such as the <a href="http://www.arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler.php">Arantius Greasemonkey script compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the two scripts: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mutlBookDetailsForm.user.js">book details form completion</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerAlpha0.2.user.js">OU Traveller</a> (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefuTravellerLib_0.2.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefuTravellerLib_0.2.xpi');return false;">OU Traveller as a Firefox extension</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Book Details Form Completion</strong><br />
This script builds on the one described in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007156.html">Lookup book Details</a> script. The original intention was to augment a very basic form that allowed library users to request a book for purchase by the OU library.</p>

<p>The new script (which runs over this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/demoBookDetailsForm.php">dummy book request form</a>) will complete the form, given an ISBN. Clicking on the 'Get Book Details' link will also create two new links: one to allow the book to be looked up in the OU library catalogue according to title, and another to provide an author look up.</p>

<p>I toyed with the idea of loading a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007304.html">Carousel Widget: Similar Books</a> into the page in an iframe (or using the JSON technique described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007299.html">Wishlist Carousel</a> to pull the related books info into the page a a list) but time has run out on me for now.</p>

<p>The Greasemonkey script shows how functionality for new services can be trialled without making changes to production systems. In a managed computer environment, such as public access library machines, new functionality can be evaluated on a sample of machines by real users if scripts are installed a selection of public access terminals. </p>

<p>Scripts can also be used to demonstrate mooted new functionality by running it over live production systems...</p>

<p>That the script creates catalogue lookup links when the 'Get book details' link is clicked on rather than installing them at page load time is just to demonstrate how logic/workflow can be built into the script. Ultimately, the aim would be to produce a 'request this book service' that checked the user's requests against books currently in the library, notifiying the user if the book is already held. In addition, the service might optionally look up related books  - particulalry ones held by the library - to see if they would meet the user's needs.</p>

<p>Building the script also revealed several 'issues'.</p>

<p>The author lookup script, reused from another script submitted as an ,a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007292.html">earlier MUTL entry</a>, identified 'issues' in framing author queries on the Voyager catalogue.</p>

<p>The ability to lookup several books with one call to the catalogue is also lacking - for example, it would be handy to be able to obtain a set of URLs (e.g. form xISBN or thingISBN) and pass them all in a single ISBN lookup query to the server, receiving a single result page listing the availability of all the books queried about in the catalogue (even better if the catalogue offered this option natively).</p>

<p><strong>OU Traveller</strong></p>

<p>The OU Traveller script represents the continued development of several <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=%22ou%20traveller%22&IncludeBlogs=1149">OU Traveller</a> components, though again it is not as fully developed as I had hoped, particularly in terms of visual design and integration with the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005845.html">Voyager Library Catalogue Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>The functionality offered by the OU Traveller script (which runs when an ISBN like number is found in a URL, as for example on Amazon) includes:<br />
<ul><li>a lookup of the book in the OU library catalogue, with status report;</li><br />
<li>different actions dependent on the OU library catalogue report for that item; for example, if the book is not held by the library, then an option is provided to request the book, which calls the dummy library 'request a book' page and prepopulates the fields using information pulled from an Amazon webservice;</li><br />
<li>a link to cite the current book using a service provided by studentabc;</li><br />
<li>a lookup of the book on O'Reilly Safari (with a link to the item if it is held there);</li><br />
<li>a lookup of the item at Google books (with a link to the item if it is held there);</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>The look and feel of the panel still leaves something to be desired, as does the way the information is presented on it.</p>

<p>Also, at the current time, if several OU Traveller scripts are running, multiple panels may be created, although typically only one will be populated (withthe result that several scripts all arite results into the same panel). Observing this led me to realise that I should have created a standalone OU Traveller panel javascript library that can be loaded into OU Traveller scripts (or embedded in the OU Traveller Toolbar (forthcoming!)).</p>

<p>This library would check to see if a panel already exists (loaded by another script) before overlaying a panel on the page. If several OU Traveller scripts were loaded, they could all display results on the same OU Traveller panel.</p>

<p>The OU Traveller panel would thus in essence represent a 'widget environment' that could manage the displayed output from one or more OU Traveller scripts. In this way, different combinations of OU Traveller functionality could be assembled by loading different sets of OU Traveller scripts, yet all the reports would be displayed b the same, common interface panel.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in working this idea up with me further, I would very much appreciate it :-)</p>

<p>As it is, each time I go in to the OU Traveller script, I try to abstract functionality out a little more, hopefully making individual components a little more reusable as I do so. However, a professional coder I am not, so the abstractions may be a little quirky at times and they are unlikely to fully exploit the power of good Javascript practice!</p>

<p>Perhaps more so than the book details lookup script, this script can be used by an individual in their own browser, although as with the other script it could also be preloaded on to public acces machines.</p>

<!--
<p>How can we use blogs to maximum effect in an OU course context? In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007310.html">When Your Past Comes to Haunt You</a>, I posted a news item about the recent AOL search data release that would potentially have been of interest to students studying <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>, if it had been in presentation at the moment, or of interest to alumni of that course as an 'alumni updating' service.</p>

<p>As it is, <em>Beyond Google</em> does not present for the first time until October, 2006; and as the course is still in production, there has been time to integrate the story of AOL's release of search data to the web into the course text.</p>

<p>At the end of that post, I also included what amounted to a text ad for the course, although I didn't go so far as adding a graphical banner ad!</p>

<p>Here, then, are several potential ways of gaining OUse-value from a blog post:</p>

<ol><li>as a <em>benefit to <strong></strong> students</em>, through pthe provision of <em>enrichment material</em> for students currently studying the course; that is, material that is optional and not assessable, but which provides and alternative way of looking at concepts or issues introduced in the course through relating them to contemporary news items;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to <strong>alumni</strong> students</em>, as updating material (think of this as a free upgrade to some software you have purchased); </li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to <strong>potential</strong> students</em>, leading them to a course that they were otherwise unaware of as the result of coming across a post in a subject they are interested in, or searching around;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to the <strong>wider community</strong></em>, as material that becomes discoverable via a search engine hence potentially the answer to somebody's search query;</li>
<li>as a <em>benefit to the <strong>course team</strong></em>, through providing draft content that can potentially be included in future presentations of the course, as well as maintaining current awareness within the course team about the state of the contemporary search landscape.</li></ol>

<p>Integrating 'live' posts - that is, course content created whilst a course is in presentation  - within the course as a topic scheduled for study  by students as a timetabled item on the course calendar is another possibility, although it raises many issues regarding the design of a) the course materials, and  also b) any related assessment material.</p>

<p>Typically, assessment material is completed before the start of the course. The OU Technology short course model means that all the assessment material for the course is provided to the students at the start of the course - an open book, known item assessment(?) strategy.</p>

<p>Writing assessment materials that can cope with content that <em>has not been written</em> at the time assessment material is prepared poses certain challenges, although strategies are available for phrasing such material. For example, questions may be asked along the lines of:</p>

<p>"Choose one of the posts that appeared on the Beoyond Google post between <em>course start date</em> and <em>assessment submission date</em>. What were the major issues/technical innovations described in the post? How are these likely to affect the current search landscape?"</p>

<p>Okay - so that's a bit contrived. But it's a pointer to the sort of question we might ask. (The <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk">Technology Short Course Programme</a> courses are aimed in part at recruitment to undergraduate study from under-represented groups and adult returners to education, so the assessment style is intended to help develop study skills and encourage reflective learning as much as anything.)</p>

<p>Another approach might be to associate a question with a blog post at the time the post is written, and feed that into the assessment engine as an optional question. One problem with this approach is that it means students addressing the assessment at different times may effectvely be presented with different question papers.</p>

<p>However, where students are required to pick '2 from 3' questions in a traditional assessment, they are then essentially <em>answering</em> different questions for assessment (<em>qua</em>mark giving) purposes. </p>

<p>And more importantly, if we are to start exploring personalised, emi-automated, rolling assessment, then this might provide one way of feeding new questions into the question bank and  reducing opportunities for plagiarism, for example by requiring students to answer <em>m</em> from <em>n</em> course blog post related questions from a <em>p</em> week window occurring within the period of time they are registered on the course.</p>

<p>The scope for innovation in all sorts of areas is huge at the moment, but I fear that we are not exploring, or even scoping, the <em>possibilities</em> as passionately as we might be...</p>

<h3 class="title">Searching for Blog Posts That Contain a Particular Link</h3>

How do you search your blog posts for the one that contained a particular link, but in a context you can't quite remember? John Tropea at LibraryClips posed me this question last week: I come across this post http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down and...
<!--
<p>How do you search your blog posts for the one that contained a particular link, but in a context you can't quite remember?</p>

<p>John Tropea at LibraryClips posed me <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/08/10/search-rollers-and-more/">this question</a> last week:<br />
<blockquote>I come across this post < ahref="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down">http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down</a> and I know I have blogged about it before.</p>

<p>How do I find my post that points to this URL?<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>JT tried a link search on <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Google blogsearch</a> using the <em>link:</em> limit to pull out posts that link to the URL in question: <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.techcrunch.com%2F2006%2F01%2F10%2Fsearchfox-to-shut-down">link:http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down</a>  but made the point that while this turned up the page he wanted, what would he do if the page returned 1000 hits or more... i.e. too many hits for it to be useful?</p>

<p>A more specific search, e.g. combining "library clips" with the link: limited query, either as keywords or as part of a <em>title:</em> limit (which searches for words in the title of the page) didn't work, and nor did a search containing the link limit with a  <em>site:</em> limit, (which would force the SERP to return pages rooted on a particular domain).</p>

<p>(John also tried various other searches using Technorati, as well as his own site search - read about them in full in his <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/08/10/search-rollers-and-more/">original post</a>.)</p>

<p>The answer is to look <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>: the <a href="http://altavista.com">Altavista</a> search engine <em>does</em> allow you to combine other limits with a <em>site:</em> limit, as this query demonstrates:</p>

<p>Search Altavista for: <a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?itag=ody&q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.techcrunch.com%2F2006%2F01%2F10%2Fsearchfox-to-shut-down+url%3Alibraryclips.blogsome.com">link:http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down url:libraryclips.blogsome.com</a></p>

<p>Many libraries are starting to make feeds of their new books available, but few make any further attempts to either exploit these feeds, or help others exploit them.</p>

<p>In an earlier<a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">MUTL</a> entry (<em><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007298.html">The Compleat Grazr/OPML Library Interface, v 0.0.1</a></em>), I doodled one way in which a new books feed could be mixed with other library feeds in an OPML feed bundle that could provide a wide ranging view of library feeds within a single, OPML fed browser widget.</p>

<p>That exercise, in conjunction with the one described in this post, also led me to realise <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007305.html">how ropey</a> many feeds produced by libraries - including the OU - actually are. mainly, I suspect, because they are produced in a rush of 'What can we feed? Err, I know, new books" enthusiasm and then left published but untested on a public page that no-one ever uses.</p>

<p>In the post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007299.html">Wishlist Carousel</a> I showed how a JSON feed could be used to feed book data into a carousel widget  that would display the resource linked book covers in a space efficient way, an approach I then developed in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007304.html">Carousel Widget: Similar Books</a>, which accepted an ISBN as part of a URL and then displayed a carousel of related books (as defined by an Amazon webservice call).</p>

<p>A later post (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007303.html">OU New Library Books Bookshelf</a>) showed how a server based application hosted on <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>) (a free application development and hosting site) could be used to consume a new books feed and push it into a carousel widget.</p>

<p>I finally managed to get a couple of hours in tonight finishing that demo, so here it is, YAOMUTLE (yet another OUseful MUTL Entry). This one is hosted on Ning, so you should be able to see the (small amount of) PHP code by signing up and cloning the app. There are a few other litterlike files around, but I don't have time to tidy up right now. I do have ideas about how to make this a proper social and shareable app, but no time to even blog them, let alone execute them. (If anyone wants to lend me a coder for a week or two, or even a day or two, please get in touch!;-)</p>

<p>MUTL entry: <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com/">Consuming library new books feeds</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="ounewbooksfeedinterpret.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ounewbooksfeedinterpret.jpg" width="438" height="399" border="0" /></p>

<p>There is a little bit of interpretation on the site linked to above, but points to note are:<br />
<ol><li>the original source feed is parsed server side and used to populate the carousel widget;</li><br />
<li>hovering over an image in the carousel widget causes several sorts of content to be loaded into the various tab display panels, which all contain <em>iframes</em>;</li><br />
<li>the book info, contents, author notes and excerpt are delivered as HTML pages from Syndetics; the related items come from an XSLT applied to a RESTful,  XML returning webservice call to Amazon webservices.</li></ol></p>

<p>The entry reuses (not necessarily mashes!):<br />
<ol><li>Bill Scott's <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">Carousel component</a>;</li><br />
<li>Patrick Fitzgerald's <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/index.php">tabber script</a>;</li><br />
<li>Alan Taylor's <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2006/05/consuming-amazons-web-api-directly.html">Amazon2JSON xslt</a></li><br />
<li>an Amazon webservice (<a href="http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemLookup&ContentType=text%2Fxml&SubscriptionId=0DK8EWAWVKXSH8SEMVR2&ItemId=0596009208&ResponseGroup=Similarities">similar items lookup</a>;</li><br />
<li>Syndetics 'catalog enrichment' content.</li></ol></p>

<p>The stuff's out there, folks, you just have to put it together in new ways...</p>

<p>So lobby the management to give you more playtime...</p>

<p>And if they ask 'why?', say the Corporate Fool said so...</p>

<h3 class="title">When Your Past Comes to Haunt You</h3>

<!--
<p>Could you be identified from a history of your online searches? It would seem to be so...</p>

<p>In August, 2006, <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6102793.html">AOL <em>deliberately</em> released search records on the web</a> amounting 20 million queries from 658, 000 users over a 3 month period from March to May, 2006, but soon retracted them.<br />
Such is the way of the web that copies were made in the meantime (of course), and the Google cache of the download page also lingered for a while. And then the hunt for who wsa searching for what began...</p>

<p>Sometimes you may deliberately opt in to keep a trace of your search history, as when you turn on <a href="http://www.google.com/searchhistory/help.html">Google's personalised search</a>, or if you opt into an <a href="http://www.attentiontrust.org/">attention recording service</a>. But more often than not, we tend to assume that what we search for is our own business. This is not a good assumption to make, because <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060123-074811">your serches are far from private</a>.</p>

<p>In Spring, 2006, a widely reported news story broke in which Google resisted attempts by the US Government's Justice Department to hand over a random sample of data about searches made using Google, albeit in aggregated and anonymised form (for example: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4631924.stm">Google data request fuels fears</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4630694.stm">BBC News: Google defies US over search data</a> and then ultimately <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/judge-tells-doj-no-on-search-queries.html">Judge tells DoJ "No" on search queries</a>).</p>

<p>Like all major search engines, <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002272.php">Google keeps track of users' search behaviour</a> using cookies in the user's browser, as well as reconciling searches against IP addresses from which the requests are made. Typically this will be an IP address registered by your ISP; so although Google may not be able to work out who you are from your IP address if you have cookies disabled, your ISP probably will be able to. The concern with handing over data to the DoJ was, then, in part a concern about privacy fears.</p>

<p>So when AOL released the block of search data (which is actually provided by Google for AOL), albeit for research purposes, the outcry against the release was swift and an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/07/aol-this-was-a-screw-up/">apology from AOL was quickly posted</a>.</p>

<p>Interfaces to the data soon followed, however, and people began to explore it, as in <a href="http://www.shmula.com/166/10-things-i-learned-from-the-aol-search-data">10 Things I learned from the AOL Search Data</a>, a post that also provides links to some online AOL data web interfaces.</p>

<p>Although the data was anonymised - individual users were given random numerical identifiers - it was only a matter of days before the <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2006/08/09/search_a_life_laid_bare.html">first user was identified from their search records</a>. (Update: see also this article on <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/search/story/0,,1859785,00.html">the tales the AOL data tells</a>.)</p>

<p>One can only expect a version of 'Through the <s>Keyhole</s> Search Box' to air next!</p>

<p>But search history is not the only way your online past can catch up to you. A couple of weeks ago, I was telling a colleague about a podcast I'd heard earlier that day: <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail876.html">Future Proofing Your Privacy</a>. At the start of the talk, the speaker, Mark Hedland, tells of how he posted to an online group a post that said...</p>

<p>Hey, why don't you <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.internet.services/browse_thread/thread/fc7b646924704e4b/45020bd72994a460?lnk=st&q=&rnum=2#45020bd72994a460">read it</a>, and why don't you <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail876.html">listen</a> to what Mark Hedland has to say first hand (the first 7 or 8 minutes particularly).</p>

<p>For those of you who haven't followed the links, here's a recap. Something that was posted over 10 years ago to a part of the web that wasn't supposed to be being archived, was - and now Mark Hedland can show how foolish he was then in thinking that was he was saying then would disappear.</p>

<p>As we talked, my colleague mentioned how 5 or so years ago they had posted a request to a news group asking for a translation of a traditional, Canadian French folk song, a translation they have since lost, along with the name of the song. (Actually, it wasn't a song, French or Canadian, but it was to do with translation; I have changed the specific details  to protect my colleague's privacy!)</p>

<p>Two minutes after leaving their office (or maybe it was three, certainly no longer than that) I mailed my colleague a link to a Google Groups search page containing their long lost post. The query used  the equivalent of these search terms: <em>translation song "sam smith"</em>. The post being searched for was the third item in the list of search results.</p>

<!--
<p>How about if you could easily, oh so easily, generate your own search engine from your resources you, or others whom you trust, have collected in the past? How about if you could actually <em>feed your own search engine</em>? How about using <em>searchfeedr</em>?</p>

<p>I <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007308.html">just posted</a> about Yahoo's latest response to <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo</a> - their new <a href="http://builder.search.yahoo.com">Search Builder</a> tool, which, like Rollyo, lets you define the sites you want to search over.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/psearch?hl=en">Google personalised search</a> takes a slightly different tack and lets you search over the sites you've visited before (which the in-built <a href="http://flock.com">flock history search</a> takes one step futher, allowing you to search over your current browsing history).</p>

<p>Biassed as I am, I still think the approach demoed in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html">deliSearch</a> is more powerful, allowing you as it does to feed the domains (or pages) you want to search over dynamically into the search page.</p>

<p>However, deliSearch was not as powerful as it could have been, limiting searches to those fed by a delicious feed. Which is where <em>searchfeedr</em> comes in.<br />
 <br />
<em>searchfeedr</em> takes <em>any</em> web feed* and uses the links it contains to limit your search either by domain, or down to the page level.</p>

<p>*well, in principle it could...;-)<br />
 <br />
As well as displaying results within the search page, you can also generate a link to the limited search and view the pages that are being used to limit the search using an embedded <a href="http://bitty.com/">Bittybrowser</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="searchfeedr.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedr.jpg" width="811" height="562" border="0" /></p>

<p>Try out <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedr.html"><em>searchfeedr</em></a> now...</p>

<p><em>searchfeedr</em> runs completely in the browser, though it does make use of several thrid party services: <a href="jttp://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> for the search, <a href="http://bitty.com">Bitty Broser</a> to view the limit feed, and <a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/">XOXO Tools</a> for the feed to JSON routine that pipes the feeds into the page in a useable way.</p>

<p><em>searchfeedr</em> code can be easily embedded in your own page (that is on my broken timeline - please let me know if you can contribute effort;-), and easily used to create link driven searches (e.g. whereby the feed link is built in and all the user has to do is enter the search term they want).</p>

<p>Note also that several link driven searches could be built in to the same page, so for example clicking one link might search over one users <em>tutorial</em> tagged resources on delicious, whereas a sencond link may trigger a search over another user's <em>bestpractice</em> tagged resources on another social bookmarking service.</p>

<p>So far, I have tried <em>searchfeedr</em> with feeds from the delicious and simpy social bookmarking services. Depending on how well XOXO Tools work, you should be able to limit  <em>searchfeedr</em> from a much wider range of feeds.</p>

<p>If <em>searchfeedr</em> takes off, I will look at guaranteeing QoS from standardised feeds, and also try and build a little slack in to the feed converter.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are six or seven extensions I have in mind for <em>searchfeedr</em>, but with holidays and other deadlines looming this probably won't appear even in very alpha form for several weeks.</p>

<p>That said, if you would like to know more - maybe even to offer a bit of coding effort;-) -  please mail me...</p>

<!--
<p>The main item of news this week in the world of personalised search is the <a href="http://builder.search.yahoo.com/m/promo">Yahoo search builder</a>, which lets you assemble your own search engine - like <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo</a> - out of a list of domains you provide it with. One nice extension over the Rollyo is the ability to add in set of keywords to further narrow the search.</p>

<p>Here's a handful of screenshots about the search engine building process.</p>

<p>First off, define what you want to search over (there's also a 'search this site' option - the customisation is for the web search):</p>

<p><img alt="yahooSearchBuilder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/yahooSearchBuilder.jpg" width="708" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>The second stage lets you customise the look of the search box:</p>

<p><img alt="yahooSearchBuilder2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/yahooSearchBuilder2.jpg" width="554" height="568" border="0" /></p>

<p>And finally, add your own banner to the results page (though you'll still get  sponsored links in the sidebar):</p>

<p><img alt="yahooSearchBuilder3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/yahooSearchBuilder3.jpg" width="596" height="596" border="0" /></p>

<p>Rollyo also mde some announcements last week about their <a href="http://www.rollyo.com/about.html">new features</a>, including a new <a href="http://www.rollyo.com/bookmarklet.html">roll bar</a>, a bookmarklet loaded overlay that taps into your own Rollyo searchrolls:</p>

<p><img alt="rollyoRollbar.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/rollyoRollbar.jpg" width="481" height="417" border="0" /></p>

<p>Rollyo still don't seem to offer PageLinks search other, which I first mooted ages ago as <a  href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/11/rollyo-portable-pagelinks-search.html">Rollyo portable</a> and then seem to have actaully built: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005913.html">Search pageLinks bookmarklet</a>. Hmm - I'd forgotten that one...</p>

<p>But I haven't forgotten these, a couple of my other previous efforts at customised/personalised, and indeed <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005914.html">bounded search</a>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html"></a> - search the links contained in a username/tag defined delicious feed; or embed the search as an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005877.html">embeddable <em>further reading</em> list search</a>;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsFeedsOPMLFeedBlenderC.html">persistent news search OPML feedroller</a> - generate an OPML feedroll of searches across several news search engines, and view the results via an OPML browser (described in more detail <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006527.html">here</a>).</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>I was tinkering with newest and most exciting doodle - <em>searchfeedr</em> - earlier this evening. If all goes to plan, it'll be the next post on this blog in an hour or two... here it is: the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007309.html"><em>searchfeedr</em>  announcement</a>...and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedr.html"><em>searchfeedr</em></a> itself...</p>

<p>For a long time there has been an informal <em>Wikiversity</em> project <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity">Wikibooks</a>, but this week a full blown <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiversity/Modified_project_proposal">Wikiversity project has been announced</a> via a presentation at the Wikimania conference (reviewed <a href="http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/index.php/2006/08/04/wikimania-day-1-jimmy-wales/">here</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Wikiversity - center for creation and use of free learning materials and activities (learning objects, books, lectures, etc.). Also host learning communities. 6-month beta trial period coming up very soon (within the month).</blockquote><br />
Wikipedia has momentum and is a global online brand with a worldwide community that has proven its engagement with the project. OpenLearn/OCI is essentially starting from nowhere.</p>

<p>Would a partnership make sense?</p>

<p>Would a quiet release of a fraction of the content intended for OCI into the Wikiversity be an interesting thing to try out, to see how the content is engaged with in the Wikimedia environment?</p>

<p>Hmm - depending on the license conditions that OCI content will appear under when the site goes live in October, maybe any old user could copy the content across?</p>

<p>PS I wonder if Wikiversity will support a content upload and reuse API? I wonder if OCI will?</p>

<!--
<p><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002785.php">Battelle</a> has just posted about <a href="http://othersonline.com/">Others Online</a>:<br />
<blockquote>a new social service that pairs search users in part by their similar queries, as well as pages visitedPicture 2-17 in web browsing and preferred interests.<br />
...<br />
While a user is browsing they can check the Others toolbar to see who else is reading or interested in the topic or site, and a dropdown provides contact to their IM or email details ...<br />
<strong>So what this means is.... Every time you search Google, you see the people who relate to those same keywords, plus their Web pages, and you can connect with them instantly by IM or email.</strong><br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - two things came to my mind immediately on reading this.</p>

<p>Firstly, should we make our courses (optionally) social in more than just the sense that all the students on a course are signed up to the same conferences/forums, and maybe wikis in our new courses?</p>

<p>For example, should students be signed up to (or allowed to opt in to (or should that be opt out of?)) IM buddy lists - with presence indicators - for other students in their tutor group or course? social bookmarking groups? Walled garden blogging communites? and so on...</p>

<p>Maybe we should even make a social toolbar available that easily connects students with other students in their course cohort (maybe it should have an off/off switch like an attention recorder? Hmm - maybe we could draw inspiration from the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=ie_toolbar_download">Linked In</a> toolbar (also the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download">LinkedIn Outlook toolbar</a> ), something that could help in conversation building or resource sharing/social discovery?</p>

<p>Secondly, identifying communities on the basis of similar search profiles seemed like a neat thing to try and build in to the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk">OCI (Open Content Initiative)</a> environment.</p>

<p>So if a user is logged in to the environment, say, and is looking for particular content, then they can 'meet' other people looking for similar things?</p>

<p>In fact - I think a question worth asking is - <em>do the OCI team want to build an environment focussed on the individual, or one focussed on community?</em></p>

<p>And if the answer is <em>both</em>, then do we need two different environments, each customised to cater for what I imagine are very different user dynamics?</p>

<p>(Just as an aside, I understand  from <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2006/07/24/we-have-a-name-openlearn/">here</a> that OCI is going to be rolled out under the banner <em>OpenLearn</em> - hmm, as of 9th July 2006, openlearn.com is "pending renewal or deletion" and openlearn.org is parked. I wonder if I should bid for the openlearn.com domain?;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">In Need of Standardisation: Library Feeds (New Books)</h3>

I've just been tinkering with a way of displaying, and hopefully adding value to "new books in the library" feeds (a development of this post that can be found in evolving form at ouseful.ning.com) and I've hit a ***huge*** problem....
<!--
<p>I've just been tinkering with a way of displaying, and hopefully adding value to "new books in the library" feeds (a development of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007303.html">this post</a> that can be found in evolving form at <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com">ouseful.ning.com</a>) and I've hit a ***huge*** problem.</p>

<p>None standardised feed descriptions.</p>

<p>Actually - I should rephrase that - <em>feeds that don't identify an ISBN within the link or description tag for each item somewhere</em>. What I had hoped was to be able to write a regular expression that would parse link and description fields looking for things that stood a good chance of being ISBNs, and using these to key the added value items (book cover, cotnents, dscription etc.)</p>

<p>Maybe more by luck than judgement, I'd picked an OU feed (maybe the only feed?) that had a link structure for each item that contained an ISBN. I scraped this to index in to various other services (book cover, for example, as well as book description and book contents listings).</p>

<p>However, it seems that most of the other feeds use a different way of describing the links (e.g. look at the link tag <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/agriculture.xml">here</a>  (<em>http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=349200</em>) and <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/ict.xml">here</a> (<em>http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=0120884364&Search_Code=ISBN&SL=None&CNT=10</em>).</p>

<p>And there is no useful description info (though some of the feeds give location info - such as classmark and whereabouts the book is in the library - in the ddescription field).<br />
 <br />
Admittedly the BBID link is cleaner - but how repurposable is each BBID? Is there a BBID2ISBN converter (and v.v.?)? And if so, is it available as a webservice? (which would be another shed load of hits on the server?)</p>

<p>So when I came to check the script with other OU new books feeds (they are arranged by topic) I found they don't work...:-(</p>

<p>Having a quick trawl of other libraries (just Google <em>library new books rss</em>) you'll find there are as many - if not more - ways of "defining" a new books feed as there are libraries who publish them.</p>

<p>Not being a librarian, or even working for a library, yet reading a lot of Library 2.0 blogs, I've noticed there seems to be a lot of gripes in the community about vendors locking data up and making it hard to repurpose.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it seems that an increasing number of people are managing to subvert the system and produce feeds - like new books feeds - using their own scripts.</p>

<p>Just like in the OU.</p>

<p>But when I started using the OU library feeds 'properly' a week or two ago, I discovered that many of them were broken/didn't validate, had lots of nonsense elements in (e.g. that broke links) and so on.</p>

<p>And looking through a handful of feeds from a handful of other sites just now, I find exactly the same pattern - feeds with item description links that all point to the <em>same</em> catalogue entry for different items, feeds with broken links (you can't have spaces and words in a link - it just won't work...it seems that many library catalogues give out junk at the end of a link - so you have to clean it! (here's a tip - try running your feeds through <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/">http://rss.scripting.com/</a>).</p>

<p>PS whilst looking at the various library feeds, I also had a look at feeds from <a href="http://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>. It seems these books are referenced according to a LibraryThing number which potentially maps onto several ISBNs (i.e. different versions of a particular book). I haven't checked to see if there is a strict one-one or many-one mapping between ISBN and LibraryThing number. Either way, an API that did round trip ISBN/LibraryThing number mappings would be handy (similary for ISBNs and OCLC numbers).</p>

<p>PPS Yes I know ISBNs are dodgy things (as the previous PS shows) but for a new book in the library, it almost definitely will have a single ISBN (not one of several possible ISBNs) associated with it, won't it? (Or won't it? I'm talking 80% of the time here...). </p>

<p>In which case, can we please, please, please try and find a way of exposing it in a consistent way in new books feeds - and then we can build some reusable and scalable apps that can be used to demo services generally and not have to be specially built for each particular feed at each particular site...</p>

<p>(Maybe the citation microformat effort will be able to help out here? Or maybe standardised use of Dublin Core? Just by the by, this list of <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/08/namespaced-extensions-in-feeds.html">RSS Feed namespaced extensions</a> came through on today's news).</p>

<h3 class="title">Carousel Widget: Similar Books</h3>

As part of another project, I've had a need for a little routine that will populate a carousel widget with 'related books' (as defined by Amazon!) given a particular ISBN. The routine can be found at http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/similarCarousel.php. It come with...

<p>As part of another project, I've had a need for a little routine that will populate a <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">carousel widget</a> with 'related books' (as defined by Amazon!) given a particular ISBN.</p>

<p>The routine can be found at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/similarCarousel.php">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/similarCarousel.php</a>.</p>

<p>It come with a couple of arguments (to date):<br />
<ul><li><em>isbn</em> - the ISBN of the book you want to find related items for;</li><br />
<li><em>size</em> - the "width" (i.e. number of book covers displayed at any one time) in the carousel.</li></ul></p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/similarCarousel.php?isbn=0131401602&size=3">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/similarCarousel.php?isbn=0131401602&size=3</a> gives:</p>

<p><img alt="relatedCarousel.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/relatedCarousel.jpg" width="338" height="154" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you do make use of this widget, and you have your own Amazon affiliate/associate ID you want to use with it, I'd appreciate it if you'd add a little function that makes 1 in 10  at random referrals using the ID provided in the script in a <em>click sharing</em> sort of way.</p>

<p>This is something I will add anyway in the next week or two if I get a chance (I'll also factor in the ID of Bill Scott - author of the carousel widget  - if he has one and I can get hold of it...). But if I don't get a chance to make this hack, and you can figure out how to <em>make it so</em> yourself, please do so... (It's late now and I need to go to bed...)</p>

<p>Having got Bill Scott's <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/y-ui-carousel-component">YUI Carousel extension</a> working with JSON fed data <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wishlistCarousel.html">here</a>, I thought I should try to use it to display OU Library new books data, for which there are <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">more than a few feeds</a> available.</p>

<p>For a change, I thought I'd try and handle this user some server scripts to consume the feed, so I built the demo at <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>, which I've been meaning try out for some time.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot:<br />

<img alt="ningCarouselDemo.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningCarouselDemo.jpg" width="570" height="483" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here's a link to the app: <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com">OUseful@Ning</a>.</p>

<p>As well as pulling book cover info in, and offering a link back to the OU Voyager catalogue entry for each item, if you hover over the cover art for a book, the app will pull in the book desctiption (if available) from <a href="http://syndetics.com">Syndetics</a>, (who also provide the cover art).</p>

<!--
<p>As well as tinkering with JSON [<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627">RFC</a>] for the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007299.html">Amazon wishlist carousel</a>, I've been looking at <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/cite-brainstorming">citation microformats</a> because I'm itching to try out a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/lc/lc.html">live clipboard</a> doodle.</p>

<p>Anyway, naive observer that I am, I wonder whether it is generally the case that there there should be a trivial translation between any particular microformat (<em>uF</em>) and an almost literal representation of the same data using JSON?</p>

<p>One major issue that comes to mind is where a uF data item is identified using more than one class attribute?</p>

<p>Anyway - it seems that mapping between JSON and microformats is one of those 'in the air' things at the moment: so here's a far better discussion of the issues than I could hope to give posted on the IBM developerWorks site a couple of days ago: <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-matters46/">Lighter than microformats: Picoformats</a>.</p>

<p>What would be handy would be a set of standard, cross-browser utility functions to produce and consume data as various microformats <em>and</em> their JSON equivalents, a bit like the hWhatever functions developed to make the Live Clipboard easier to use (e.g. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/lc/hCal.js">hCal generator</a>, <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/lc/hCard.js">hCard generator</a>. (The originals are linked to from the Microsoft <a href="http://rayozzie.spaces.live.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/techPreview.html">Live Clipboard developer notes</a>, but the Windows Live Space page they live on appears to be down at the moment....)</p>

<p>And here's something else to add to the mix while I'm on this topic - and an approach that would also benefit from a few demo/standardised <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/MicroModels">uF2RDF XSLTs</a> - <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec">GRDDL</a>:<br />
<blockquote>a mechanism for Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages; that is, for getting RDF data out of XML and XHTML documents using explicitly associated transformation algorithms, typically represented in XSLT.</blockquote><br />
A good overview can be found here: <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2005/08/01/microformats-on-the-grddl/">Microformats on the GRDDL</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/grddl-wg/">W3C GRDDL working group</a> has just formed to try and progress this approach to data transformation and reuse, which should add even more momentum to the microformat cause as a side-effect.</p>

<!--
<p>A few weeks ago, a really neat trick appeared on the <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/default.asp">Kokogiak blog</a> showing how to go about <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2006/05/consuming-amazons-web-api-directly.html">Consuming Amazon's Web API Directly with Javascript (via JSON and XSLT)</a>.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a reason to try that technique out ever since then, and had half a mind that I'd like to use the approach to develop some sort of personally hosted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007181.html">bookshelf interface</a> for my Amazon wishlist, as a precursor to trying out the same thing for OU Library new books listings (I was thinking of something along the lines of a homebrew version of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007105.html">Blogbridge Library</a> interface).</p>

<p>So when the rather neat <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">Carousel component</a> extension to the Yahoo user interface (YUI) tools appeared, I realised the ideal opportunity had arrived.</p>

<p>So much so in fact that I had to take today off as holiday so I could spend some guilt free time tinkering with code;-) And the result?</p>

<p><img alt="amazonXSLTcarousel.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonXSLTcarousel.jpg" width="470" height="172" border="0" /></p>

<p>...or see a demo here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wishlistCarousel.html">Carousel and Amazon2JSON Wishlist demo</a></p>

<p>The script at the moment is a bit crude and needs tidying/fully reconciling against the YUI libraries. However, it does demonstrate quite a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the use of an Amazon webservice to pull down my wishlist information: <a href="http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&AWSAccessKeyId=0P7A6QBN369NCGYXWBR2&Operation=ListLookup&AssociateTag=robofestauk-21&ListType=WishList&ListId=2ROK7CTRHGK11&ResponseGroup=Request,ListFull,Medium">Amazon wishlist feed</a></li>
<li>the use of  an Amazon webservice powered XSLT against <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wishlist2json.xsl">this XSL file</a> to produce <a href="http://xml-uk.amznxslt.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&AWSAccessKeyId=0P7A6QBN369NCGYXWBR2&Operation=ListLookup&AssociateTag=robofestauk-21&ListType=WishList&ListId=2ROK7CTRHGK11&ResponseGroup=Request,ListFull,Medium&Style=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wishlist2json.xsl&ContentType=text/javascript&CallBack=amzJSONCallback">this JSON feed</a>;</li>
<li>how to pull in a JSON feed to a file and then consume it (cribbed from Kokogiak; this actually needs revising to just use YUI components, which will make the code a bit tidier);</li>
<li>the use of Bill Scott's <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">YUI carousel component</a> to display the images.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main reasons I like this approach is that the solution can be managed completely on the client side. That is, no need for server access (assuning you can pull the necessary YUI files in from somewhere) or browser jiggery pokery trying to get around the browser cross-site XML security policies.</p>

<p>That said, the next demo I have in mind for the carousel component - using it to display new books in the library by consuming the new books feeds - I think I will do on a server. Using <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>, maybe? Then others can play along too even if they don't have access to a server of their own...</p>

<p><strong>Update 14/8/06:</strong>: here's another demonstration of using JSON to populate the widget with book covers, a <a href="http://exlibris.ath.cx/?p=90">new books</a> carousel. This also adds a reflection of the book cover, which is a neat effect.</p>

<!--
<p><em>Preamble:</em> In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007296.html">So What Exactly Are Library Feeds Good For?</a> I showed several screenshots that demonstrated how a wide variety of library related feeds could be aggregated using an OPML file and displayed within the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> OPML browser. In this post, I discuss this 'presentational mashup' in a little more detail, and offer it up as a entry to the Talis <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashuip Competition</a>.</p>

<p>More and more libraries are making web feeds (RSS and Atom feeds) available covering a wide variety of Library related services including, but not limited to:<ul><br />
<li>patrons' library details (e.g. current loans and overdue books);</li><br />
<li>lists of new books in the library;</li><br />
<li>lists of institional open access/OAI eprints;</li><br />
<li>lists of print and ejournal subscriptions;</li><br />
<li>Opensearch-like feeds from library catalogues;</li><br />
<li>subject librarian recommended websites/resources.</li><br />
</ul>...as well as Library news, events or blog feeds, wiki update feeds, and so on...</p>

<p>In addition, many content providers make book or journal information available via syndication or other XML feeds, such as:<ul><br />
<li>book contents and summaries;</li><br />
<li>book cover graphics;</li><br />
<li>journal current issue contents and abstracts;</li><br />
<li>persistent search results.</li><br />
</ul>Certainly within my own academic library, I have been pushing for the publication of ever more feeds <em>just because</em>, with little thought about how they may best be used.</p>

<p>Many of these feeds have been created rather 'casually', and on inspection/attempted use do not validate (e.g. using a validator such as the one found at <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/">rss.scripting.com</a>, such is the pace<br />
at which some of these feeds were produced. That some of the feeds remained online with errors<br />
for so long also suggests that uptake of/subscription to them is very low indeed.</p>

<p>One of the "live" issues for the OU library at the current time is how best to integrate<br />
library services within the new Moodle VLE that is being developed for course delivery from 2007.</p>

<p>There are  several key issues when considering library service integration, not least among<br />
them:<ol><br />
<li>What services are users likely to use?</li><br />
<li>when and where are users likely to require these services?</li><br />
<li>what sort of interface should e used to deliver these services?</li><br />
</ol>In any learning environment, screen real estate tends to be a carefully managed resource, with diffferent areas of the environment exposing different services.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is clear - if library services are consigned to their own page, they are likely to become ghettoised within the VLE and are unlikely to be used 'in context'  - if at all - by the majority of users. One click away may be be one click away too many.</p>

<p>However, if all the library services could be collected together in an easily navigated, small embedded library panel, then they could be made available at the point of use.</p>

<p>The embedded Grazr OPML browser shown below demonstrates a first attempt at a) scoping out what feeds/services might be included in a feed based library interface; and b) displaying such feeds in a compact manner.</p>

<div style="height:400px; width:400px"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?font=arial&amp;fontsize=9pt&amp;linktarget=_blank&amp;file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml"></script><a href="http://grazr.com"><img style="border:none" src="http://grazr.com/images/gzlogo.png" alt="grazr" onload="GrazrLoad(this)" /></a></div>

<p>You can find a copy of the OPML file that feeds the above example at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml</a>. Note that this file does not contain a link to my (authenticated) user details.</p>

<p>The OPML file has the following structure:</p>

<p>...<br />
&lt;outline text="New Books" &gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="New books: ICT" xmlUrl="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/ict.xml" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="New books: Adult and Continuing Education" xmlUrl="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/adultconted.xml" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/outline&gt;<br />
&lt;outline text="Journal Current Issues"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="The Computer Journal" xmlUrl="http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/rss/current.xml" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="IEEE Pervasive Computing" xmlUrl="http://csdl.computer.org/rss/pervasive.xml" /&gt<br />
&lt;/outline&gt;<br />
...</p>

<p>The &lt;outline text=""&gt; links define 'directories' (which may be nested, I think).</p>

<p>The &lt;outline type="rss"&gt; links define the feeds that are contained within each 'directory'.</p>

<p>To generate your own OPML file, save the OPML file linked to above, and then open it in a  text browser. Replace the headings and feeds with your own headings and feeds, save the file and upload it to webserver. You can then view the file via <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html">http://grazr.com/config.html</a></p>

<p>As stated above, my feed bundle is just a first attempt - it does not include a section for librarian blogs, or library news and events, for example (though it could easily consume my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful blog feed</a>, and maybe even an iCal (or other calendar generated) feed).</p>

<p>If  you are a librarian out there who wants to join in the mashup competition, but perhaps don't have the programming skills required to build a 'technical' mashup, why not post some alternative OPML feed bundles that demonstrate differently structured interfaces to the library system?</p>

<p>Alternatively, why not show off differnt feed mixes using a webtop such as Google/ig, Netvibes, or Pageflakes?</p>

<p>Or come up with a library customised page on Zimbio?</p>

<p>All these are - I believe - acceptable things to enter into the mashuip competition...</p>

<p>Remember - the feeds are increasingly out there, but how many people use them. (Do you?). We are still to find effective ways for the majority of users to use them, and coming up with sensible feed mixes - and ways of consuming those mixes <em>in context</em> - are, I believe, still lacking...</p>

<p><em>For the purposes of the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Talis "Mashup the Library" Competition, 2006</a> my submission is actually a two part submission: firstly, the demonstrated use of OPML to bundle library related feeds and display them in an integrated, and page embeddable, way using Grazr; secondly, the selection and organisation of feeds bundled together in the full version of the  OPML file demonstrated on this page (i.e. the version of the file that includes patron loan/overdue books details (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007296.html">screenshots</a>).</em></p>

<p>I would , however, encourage other people to submit 'rival' OPML files to the competition showing different ways of mixing library related feeds in a single OPML file. Being a lazy type, if someone else can find an effective mix that I can pinch, it saves me the trouble;- )</p>

<p>PS When I get a chance, I will post a screencast of the browser in action here...</p>

<p>PPS Ideally, of course, what we really need is an easy to use tool that allows users to straightforwardly create a library feed mix...<br />

<!--
<p>Every day, yet another library seems to proudly boast that it has set up a raft of Library feeds (I myself produly announced this fact several times when the OU library started to open up feeds for all sorts of things). But I found myself wondering last night: why? What good does it do?</p>

<p>And so I set about trying to bundle feeds together so that I could live outside the library pages, just surviving off the feeds the library provides.</p>

<p>One environment within which I could develop my own customised, feed fed library page is Netvibes, of course, and I'll post a demo page or two using that space in a week or two.</p>

<p>But for now, here's a demo of using the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> OPML browser as a surrogate library website.</p>

<p>I should at this point say that the demo does not just use OU Library feeds - the OpenSearch feeds from the catalogue are due along anytime, but they're not quite ready yet. So I've borrowed some from elsewhere (from <a href="http://www.hclib.org/pub/search/RSS.cfm">Hennepin County Library</a>, in fact).</p>

<p>So - here then are the feeds that go into the mix:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryTop.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryTop.jpg" width="402" height="410" border="0" /></p>

<ul><li>My Library Feeds;</li>
<li>New books in the OU Library;</li>
<li>S804 (an OU course) <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> links;</li>
<li>current contents lists for a selection of journals;</li>
<li>a couple of saved persistent searches on the Hennepin County Library catalogue;</li>
<li>recent eprints (from Glasgow - the OU feed is firewalled...)</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of my library feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyDetails.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyDetails.jpg" width="244" height="73" border="0" /></p>

<p>and then:</p>

<p>Here are some book details:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryBookDetails.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryBookDetails.jpg" width="413" height="105" border="0" /></p>

<p>(maybe nice if the contents lists, or a summary description were pulled in to this feed, perhaps?). Clicking the link should take you through to the linrary catalgue page for that book (but there's a tiny error in the link at the mo...)</p>

<p>The overdue library books feed works too - oops...:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryOverdue.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryOverdue.jpg" width="410" height="80" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryNewBooks.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryNewBooks.jpg" width="300" height="77" border="0" /></p>

<p>which are handled just like the books in my library record (clicking on a feed leads to a list of books, and clicking on one of those leads to book details).</p>

<p>The MyOpenLibrary feeds are feeds of resources, sorted by topic, and selected by subject area experts to be relevant to the particular course:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLFeeds.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLFeeds.jpg" width="250" height="122" border="0" /></p>

<p>What's neat about the Journals feed:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLJournals.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLJournals.jpg" width="401" height="205" border="0" /></p>

<p>is that if you click through to a particular journal:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLJournalsItem.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLJournalsItem.jpg" width="391" height="87" border="0" /></p>

<p>when you follow the link you open in a new tab the libezproxied journal page (i.e. you are logged in to it...).</p>

<p>The same should be true with the database links, but I'm not sure they're set up correctly (they still seem to be using athens, which I thought we'd stop using?). Anyway, <em>in principle</em> you should be able to just click through straight into a logged in page on the daatbase site.</p>

<p>The Current Journal Issues feeds are just a few I pulled together from different publishers' sites.</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalIssues.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalIssues.jpg" width="344" height="103" border="0" /></p>

<p>It would be nice to automatically reconcile feeds from <a href="http://zetoc.mimas.ac.uk/">Zetoc</a> with the Journal feeds from MyOL, for example, but I'm not sure if there is an ISSN2feed url service available form Zetoc?</p>

<p>Clicking on a journal gives the current contents list:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalContents.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalContents.jpg" width="412" height="285" border="0" /></p>

<p>and clicking through to an item displays the abstract:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalAbstract.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalAbstract.jpg" width="415" height="269" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment clicking the link opens up a tab containing the journal web page for that article. Idellay this would be libezproxified first...</p>

<p>The persistent library search feeds are canned searches I predefined when I wrote the OPML fle that drives this Grazr demo:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearch.jpg" width="353" height="86" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here are some results:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearchResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearchResults.jpg" width="379" height="209" border="0" /></p>

<p>A neat thing about the book details page is the way the book cover image is also pulled in:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearchItem.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearchItem.jpg" width="382" height="198" border="0" /></p>

<p>Finally, the ePrints feed (in this case, borrowed from Glasgow):</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryeprints.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryeprints.jpg" width="256" height="61" border="0" /></p>

<p>again giving results that link through to result item abstracts and if necessary on to the actual report in the eprint repository:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryeprintsResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryeprintsResults.jpg" width="417" height="224" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to have a play, I popped a demo (less the My Library feeds which use my library authentication details) at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryDemo.html">Library OPML browser demo</a>. </p>

<p>Update: Alternatively, check out this <a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59%2FousefulLibraryTest.opml&submit=Submit">Optimal browser view</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="optimalOUView.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimalOUView.jpg" width="374" height="446" border="0" /></p>

<p>[NB hopefully dummy user details will be available soon to demonstrate the <em>My Library Details</em> feeds.]</p>

<p>You can see a copy of the OPML file <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note that the only thing that I had to do to create this demo was to write the OPML file (I copied another OPML file to get the structure qnd fiund the feeds URLs wherever) and upload it to a server; I then pasted the URL of the uploaded OPML file into the config box on <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html">http://grazr.com/config.html</a> and copyied the HTML that was generated into a dummy web page. Uploading this to the server provided me with my demo. For reference, I spent far longer blogging the demo than I did crreating it...</strong></p>

<p>PS I'm glad to see that some 'proper' mashups are starting to appear in the Talis Library Mashup competition, such as <a href=" http://www.bibliopage.com/">Bibliopage</a>. But it would also be nice to see simple stuff that any old librarian can use, without them having to know one end of a  client-server script from the other. So I wonder, are simple, simple presentation based mashups that just encourage people to wire up content in neat ways to legacy presentational devices likely to be accepted as valid entries? Any chance of Talis offering £100 or a similar token amount (or maybe just an Amazon gift voucher?) for the best use of Netvibes (or similar) for displaying library related feeds?</p>
