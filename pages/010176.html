<h3 class="title">Embedding youTube Movies in "Commercial" elearning Materials</h3>

<p>One of the things I (supposedly) do when not tinkering with Web 2.0 toys is look after an introductory OU short course on <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t184">robotics</a>.</p>

<p>Robotics as a subject area is pretty well suited to making reuse of 3rd party content to illustrate points, especially in an online course: movies and images are order of the day, as you might imagine:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q0ubRMw8L8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q0ubRMw8L8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>The question is, could I legitimately embed a youTube movie (assuming I could verify that it was a 'legitimately' uploaded video, of course;-) in course materials that are only viewable by registered (i.e. fee paying) students?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms">youTube T&C</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>F. YouTube permits you to link to materials on the Website for personal, non-commercial purposes only. In addition, YouTube provides an "Embeddable Player" feature, which you may incorporate into your own personal, non-commercial websites for use in accessing the materials on the Website, provided that you include a prominent link back to the YouTube website on the pages containing the Embeddable Player. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the YouTube Website at any time.</blockquote></p>

<p>So is an OU online course a commercial service? Can I embed a movie under the above condition or not?</p>

<p>If anyone is has tried to get youTube movies embedded in an online course and/or has taken advice from their rights department on this topic (as I am about tto do) I'd be interested in hearing how you got on...</p>

<p>Similarly, if anyone is using <em>any</em> third party service as an integral part of their course (flickr, maybe?), how did you get on?</p>

<p>I know there were discussions here at the OU about the possibility of getting students to use flickr in our new <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography short course</a>, with an OU developed front end plugged into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">flickr API</a>.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason, that route wasn't taken and instead a flickr clone was built in-house. (I'm not sure what sort of export options or sharing support/API is available though? In the time available for development, I'd guess flickr offers more... and I don't know whether the storage space is capped, either?)</p>

<p>Whilst rights aren't my strong thing, I could imagine that the following would be treated differently:</p>

<p>1) a course team/instructor getting a youTube movie (or flickr slideshow etc.) embedded in some formally delivered elearning materials;</p>

<p>2) a student embedding a youTube movie in a personal, course related blog post using a blogging system provided by their HEI to support their studies.</p>

<p>I don't know if things get trickier if, in the second case, the blog post is only viewable behind an HEI firewall/student registration required "paywall", compared to a situation where the blog is public?</p>

<p>Just by the by, this idea of PLE vs VLE published content ties in with the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">String'n'Glue Learning Environment</a> appproach, as well as the notion of <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002885.html">"distributed content publishing"</a>: <em>"The challenge with the distributed content model (the notion that educational content comes to the learner's space, rather than the learner coming to a space decided by the educational facility) is that it runs against the in-grained assumptions of our value point in higher education or corporate environments.</em>"]</p>

<p>I have to admit that inspiration deserts me at the moment about where to go for advice on the issue of "can I/can't I embed 3rd party widget serving content" outside of the OU, (in part given I couldn't find any way of mailing youTube support;-)? JISC (err... which bit?)? <a href="http://www.cetis.ac.uk/">CETIS</a> (because this is all about reuse, right?;-)?</p>

<p>PS as well as looking for tales about using flickr'n'youTube like content/services as an integral part of an elearning course, I also need to play catch-up with how social bookmarking is being used for real in K12-HEI education <em>by the students</em>. Any and all pointers, war stories etc. appreciated - feel free to tag stuff for me (<em>psychemedia</em>) on delicious...;-0</p>

<p>PS I just spotted over on the Google Blog that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-expecting.html">presentations will soon be added to the Google docs'n'spreadsheets mix</a>...</p>
