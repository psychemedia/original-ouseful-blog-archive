<p>In my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011088.html">write up of John Seely Brown's OpenLearn 2007 Keynote</a>, I noted that several 'official' conference bloggers had reported on the talk with the aside that "[I] wonder what would happen<s>d</s> if i passed each of these posts through the same content analysis tool... would the posts give rise to the same keywords?"</p>

<p>Any, I see that r3becca has beaten me to tinkering (! ;-) around this idea, with a post on <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/blog-analysis/">Blog Analysis</a> which compares <a href="http://www.tagcrowd.com/">TagCrowd</a> generated tag cloud visualisations of three of the posts, including this one of my post:</p>

<p><img src="http://ochre.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/tony2.png" alt="Tag cloud visualisation of the OUseful info blog post of John Seeley Browns OpenLearn 2007 keynote" /></p>

<p>Erik Duval also visualised the keynote directly using the <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">MindMeister</a> web based mind mapping app  - <a href="http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/wordpress/eduval/?p=221">JSB at OpenLearn</a>.</p>

<p>Just by the by, I wonder what an outline view of the actual presentation slides would look like?</p>

<p>[UPDATE: there's an article that covers most of the ground mentioned in this talk here: <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Review/MindsonFireOpenEducationt/45823?time=1201597685">Educase review: Minds on Fire: Open Education, the Long Tail, and Learning 2.0</a>]</p>

<p>[I wasn't going to post these notes, as notes, but I think it's interesting to compare my notes with those of a couple of others who blogged the same talk...  <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/john-seely-brown-patrick-reporting/">John Seely Brown - Patrick reporting</a>, <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/johnseelybrownjpg/">OpenLearn Keynote Address by John Seely Brown</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ac/rMEc/~3/177117335/">Open Learning Broadly Construed</a> and <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/john-seely-brown-keynote-speech/">John Seely Brown Keynote Speech</a> (hmm - i wonder what would happend if i passed each of these posts through the same content analysis tool... would the posts give rise to the same keywords? ;-) A main difference, I think, is that my post: 1) is built up from keywords and phrases, with occasional personal comments, rather than a personal prose commentary of the presentation (I tend to do that <em>post hoc</em>, writing up talk notes on the evening of, or days following, the event); 2) my post includes links, and 3) I found and skimmed those links whilst the presentation was on (partial attention!), complementing the presentation with the Google font of knowledge...;-)]<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a> - Open Learning Broadly Construed</p>

<p>Coals to Newcastle, given OU status in open and distance education.</p>

<p>Routes to sustainability<br />
Leveraging learning that always happens... e.g. immersive language learning</p>

<p>"Cartesian view of learning" - transfer of knowledge, "I teach, you learn" delivery models, naturally fosters subject disciplines..</p>

<p>cf. the social view of learning,  "we participate therefore we are", <em>understanding</em> (rather than knowledge) is socially constructed.</p>

<p>"We learn in and through our interaction with others and the world."</p>

<p>Nothing beats collaborative study groups - best indicator of ??? is the ability to join and participate in a collaborative study group.</p>

<p>This works in the distributed world (e.g. via IM) as well as face-to-face.</p>

<p>"The social life of learning".</p>

<p>Students are already embedded in a social network (from home, school etc.) when they arrive at university, and this forms one special sort of study group...</p>

<p>The best way to learn something is to teach something - study groups again....</p>

<p>Learning as supported through participatory architectures...</p>

<p>Come to understand knowledge through conversations with others.</p>

<p>The architecture studio - the <a href="http://www.architexturez.net/+/subject-listing/000013.shtml">atelier form of learning</a>, a powerful social learning envt<br />
 - learning as enculturation into a practice;<br />
 - work in progress is made public;<br />
-&gt; peripheral participation layer.</p>

<p>Beyond textbook learning, from learning-about, to learning-to-be.</p>

<p>**Can we reverse the flow - turn passionate learning-to-be into learning about.. "Unleashing productive enquiry"</p>

<p>Technology enabled active learning <a href="http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/teal_tour.htm">TEAL</a><br />
Move MIT electo/mag course to a studio based model. "Sage on the stage" doesn't work...</p>

<p>Faulkes telescope</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/dweb.shtml">Decameron web</a>, (<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ach_allc2001/papers/roz/index.html">SGML backbone</a>) - a new forum for partipatory scholarship.</p>

<p>'Modern' kids from the global world, mobile phones and web connectivity.</p>

<p>Tinkering as a  learning platform - it's death and rebirth as remix, mashups.</p>

<p>tinkering stop - devices became cognitively impenetrable; then tinkering returned... open source, game mods, media remix<br />
Tinkering today is gender neutral [??!?!?!always was?? - tinkering in kitchen and home, clothingg etc actively pursued by women..]</p>

<p>Polyani - tacit knowledge - <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm">http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm</a></p>

<p>Life in the digital age - a culture of participation: tinkering, building, remixing, sharing. Creating meaning - I produce and others build on.</p>

<p>Ying and yang of production and consumption</p>

<p>Open source as a participatory learning platform; distributed, situated learning. Process of enculturation - pick up sensibilities and practices of a pre-existing, working community.</p>

<p>Remix and mashup - creative tinkering and the play of imagination; fan fiction [but also think play - playing out TV scenes];</p>

<p>Filling in backstory -creative reading.</p>

<p>[??how could this tie in with <a href="http://www.wwcd.org/action/Boal.html">Theatre of the Oppressed/Forum Theatre</a>]</p>

<p>The Brewing Sotrm of opportunity - OER, eScience, eHumanities, web 2.0 -&gt; Open Participatory Learning Ecosystem (with feedback loops galore)</p>

<p>What are the ways of closing the loop and fostering intertwining</p>

<p>Fundamental trend - from scarcity to abundance<br />
Manufacturing economy  - consumer society - creator economy (culture of co-creation and participation)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-Tail-Endless-Creating-Unlimited/dp/1844138518?tag=ouseful-21">Long Tail</a></p>

<p>Long Tail in Learning... supporting the rise of an ecology of learning/doing niches</p>

<p>Active blending - yin-yang odf learning on the one hand and research/doing/making on the other.</p>

<p>From stock (supply push), to flow (demand pull)<br />
From a stable world to a rapidly changing world [but what is it that's changing?]</p>

<p>Learning 2.0 - learning on demand.</p>

<p>When recreation becomes re-creation/remix and productive enquiry: a culture of learning, participatory life long learning and the ultimate sustainability model... [BUT - I prefer daily learning; just as a social app should have a personal payoff, lifelong learning needs appropriate daily practice]<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn2007" rel="tag">openlearn2007</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Two or three weeks ago now, I was invited to take part in an OU Library Futures workshop, which was tasked with identifying key areas that need to be addressed in putting together a Library strategy to 2012.</p>

<p>One of the points made early on by <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/">Lorcan Dempsey</a>, (who we were fortunate enough to have at the OU as part of his late summer, European tour!) was that academic libraries have traditionally provided a home and access point for high quality information.</p>

<p>This positioning is under threat from users migrating to the search engines - Google in particular, but also Yahoo (and Yahoo Answers): what <em>do</em> you do when your students visit Google rather than one of the many database search engines your library offers (or in these enlightened times, your federated search interface)?</p>

<p>One of the things that occurred to me, and that we briefly explored in roundtable workshop discussion, was that maybe it's time for a <em>library flip</em> in which the library acts so as to raise the profile of information it would traditionally have served, within the search engine listings and at locations where the users actually are.</p>

<p>In an academic setting, this might even take the form of helping to enhance the reputation of the IP produced by the institution and make it discoverable by third parties using public web search engines, which in turn would make it easy for our students to discover OU Library sponsored resources using those very same tools.</p>

<p>Lorcan summed this up with the strapline: "Enhance your reputation with the OU library" (although maybe that should be <em>via</em> the OU Library?).</p>

<p>Over the last few days, I've started thinking about this again, in particular within  the context of the preservation of scholastic "works" published through the medium of blogs.</p>

<p>Again, Lorcan is on the ball: "Which brings me to my question. Universities and university libraries are recognizing that they have some responsibility to the curation of the intellectual outputs of their academics and students. So far, this has not generally extended to thinking about blogs. What, if anything, should the [HEIs] be doing to make sure that this valuable discourse is available to future readers as part of the scholarly record?"<a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001467.html">[P]ersistent academic discourse</a></p>

<p>Related to this is a conversation I tried to start with the library when we were developing the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk./tu120">Beyond Google</a> info skills course was the extent to which the Library should be responsible for the preservation of <em>at least</em> certain "high profile" blog posts (that is, ones that get widely bookmarked or referenced in other blog posts and as such may play an important role in some wider discourse).</p>

<p>One approach I thought might be interesting would be to find some way of archiving particular blog posts within the context of the <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk">ORO/open repositories online</a> project. The conversation went nowhere at the time, but I wonder if it is worth revisiting now?</p>

<p>As well as blog posts, link collections (that is, "web resource bibliographies"!;-) and slideshows are becoming for me - and many others - part of our scholastic output. I consider it more or less my <em>academic responsibility</em> now to post copies of my presentations to online, social archiving services like <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>, even though the sort of presentation I prefer may not be so "readable" to anyone who comes across just the slides...! (which is why I also tend to support my presentations with link collections that offer a bit more detail about the context of each of the slides).</p>

<p>As far as I know, ORO submissions are primarily about archiving published, peer reviewed papers. That is, ORO is intended to act as a local store for articles that have been published as a matter of formal academic record.</p>

<p>In contrast, blogs and presentations tend to be part of the <em>ongoing academic conversation</em>, although they may, on occasion, produce quotable moments.</p>

<p>To reiterate Lorcan's question - to what extent are these conversations worth preserving? And who should be preserving them?</p>

<p>PS see also <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/lriu/entry/the_next_wave/"> The next wave is rising: university digital presses</a>: "Digital presses may well be the next widespread development in universities. Librarians are well placed to do the electronic publishing and curation, in collaboration with academics doing the authoring and editorial. ... Equally the development of OA IRs can be seen as part of the larger wave towards university presses, since OA IR content can effectively be overlaid with editorial control. There is not a huge difference between a well-established overlay journal and an electronic journal."<br />

<h3 class="title">The Ultimate Steal?</h3>

<!--
<p>Having just spent an hour or so doing domestic tech support - the family PC doesn't have Powerpoint on it, though it does have a Powerpoint 2007 Viewer - I very nearly gave in to just going down to PC World and buying a new laptop and a copy of Office...</p>

<p>Here's how the story goes:</p>

<p>"Have we got Powerpoint, because I need to do a presentation...?"</p>

<p>"No - use <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google...</a>". Thinking - "Hmm, maybe I should mention <a href="http://show.zoho.com">Zoho</a>...? No, perhaps best not to...."</p>

<p>"?"</p>

<p>"Log in to your Google account and go to <em>docs.google.com</em> - then open a presentation or whatever it's called..."</p>

<p>Later - "how do I get a presentation in to it?"</p>

<p>"Import a document... here, I'll show you...".</p>

<p>The upload hangs, CTRL-ALT-DEL has no effect and the machine needs a hard restart...</p>

<p>"Okay - we'll put <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> on the machine..."</p>

<p>Thinks... "Actually, I'll put <a href="http://sun.com/staroffice">StarOffice</a> on... It's free via <a href="http://pack.google.com">Google Pack</a>, I think..."</p>

<p>[Downloads and installs Star Office; my thinking is that the Google Updater will keep it up to date...]</p>

<p>Every time Star Office starts, there's a wizard to help open a file, start a new presentation etc... but I don't want the wizard... HOW DO I MAKE IT GO AWAY?! Cancelling the wizard closes Star Office... Okay, so I tick "Don't show this wizard again" and go through the wizard to create a dummy presentation...</p>

<p>Opening a pre-existing presentation by clicking on it opens it into the Powerpoint viewer, the default for our home PC. </p>

<p>Panic: "I can't open my files..."</p>

<p>"Of course you can..."</p>

<p>[Right click, open with...]</p>

<p>"How did you do that...?"</p>

<p>"Hang on, I'll change it so it always opens Powerpoint files in Star Office..."</p>

<p>"No, don't, please, don't, it won't work when I use it on another machine..."</p>

<p>Sigh..."Yes it will - I'm setting <em>this</em> machine to open files of <em>that</em> type in a particular application... It has nothing to do with the file itself..."</p>

<p>"Can I be sure the presentation will just work when I try to use it on another machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes  - of course... just save it as a Powerpoint presentation."</p>

<p>Saving it gives a 'some formatting may be lost' error when saving the doc from Star Office as a Powerpoint file...</p>

<p>"Don't worry - it'll be fine; here - look, you can view it with the Powerpoint Viewer..."</p>

<p>Doesn't work - not compatible... "Hmmm..."</p>

<p>I switch on my Mac, fire up Parallels, open the doc in Powerpoint on Mac Parallels XP...</p>

<p>"Okay - it works fine in Powerpoint. So you could do what you have to in Star Office, then I'll load it into Powerpoint and save it as a proper Powerpoint file..."</p>

<p>Thinks... "Maybe I should just buy a copy of Office...";</p>

<p>Looks - a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/suites/default.aspx">free 60 day download trial for Office</a> is available...</p>

<p>"Is 60 days use long enough?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We could use the 60 day trial..."</p>

<p>Thinks...</p>

<p>"Hmm, but after then, we maybe won't be able to use the old version of Word we've currently got, and we'll probably have to buy Office anyway if you want to carrying on using Word..."</p>

<p>Thinks...</p>

<p>Aloud - "shall we just buy a copy of Office? Because you're a student it's only forty quid from this <a href="http://www.theultimatesteal.co.uk/">Ultimate Steal</a> thing. All you need is a dot, A C, U K address."</p>

<p>"I don't..."</p>

<p>"What's your student email address?"</p>

<p>"[xyz123]", or something similar...</p>

<p>"@?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"At??? [xyz123] AT what?"</p>

<p>"Southampton".</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"ac uk."</p>

<p>"Right - a dot A C U K address.."</p>

<p>Thinks... hmm - Office 2007 ultimate, or whatever it is, might struggle on our old Windows XP Home machine..."</p>

<p>Looks - another - old  - works laptop has appeared; Windows 98; boots - system disk error...</p>

<p>"Take the floppy out..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"There's a floppy in there - take it out and start the machine again..."</p>

<p>There is - "How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"When you booted, it tried to boot from the floppy?"</p>

<p>"?" - blank look...</p>

<p>"When you start the computer, it has to boot up... boot up? ... Never mind... Tt's, err, I've seen it happen before; and there was a floppy in the drive then; so there could be now. Take it out and restart it, it'll be fine..."</p>

<p>The old, old Windows 98 laptop starts up - faster than our family XP PC...</p>

<p>Powerpoint - success :-)</p>

<p>Whilst trying, "Can I use my USB stick with this...?"</p>

<p>Nothing - no driver...</p>

<p>"We'd have to find a driver..."</p>

<p>The machine has no wireless, is not networked.</p>

<p>"You could use a floppy..." - the home PC has one... "but the computer you have to give the presentation from probably won't; so you'd have to use the floppy to put it back on the PC, then copy it onto the memory stick... Do you want a new laptop?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Do we need that PC? Do you just want a new laptop? And we'll put Office on it?"</p>

<p>Thinks - I have a new laptop for a robot project... Sighs... "Use this... the account is X and the password is Y" (there's a big label stuck on the machine with those details...</p>

<p>"What? Hang on. I'll write it down..."</p>

<p>"There - it's written there...[arghhh]... "</p>

<p>Starts... starts Powerpoint - something or other version incompatibility...</p>

<p>"There's a 'version incompatibility..."</p>

<p>"What? WHAT?" Click it away... "There, it's fine, what's the problem?.... Now just make sure you only save to and from the memory stick, because I need to keep that account clean..."<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hassle" rel="tag">hassle</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/office" rel="tag">office</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Just before the summer break, one of my colleagues, John Monk, put together a series of short video clips (voiced over images and short animations) that describe various ICT related concepts. In his own words:<br />
<blockquote>I produced a number of short videos to assess what was involved in asking students to produce media clips as part of their assessment, whether or not it would add to learning and what would be involved in marking. My conclusion is that a combination of media clip and story board used in the preparation of the clip has some potential. (It is quite taxing to explain a concept in a few seconds and you really get to the essence of things even if it does not quite emerge in the finished product).</blockquote></p>

<p>You can see them all on <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=monkjoh&amp;p=r">John Monk's YouTube Channel</a>.</p>

<p>Here a complete list of the 16 movies John made:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq16cBscgA">Information: symbols</a> Threatening technologies are symbols of intent that aim to affect peopleâ€™s behaviour more by their symbolism than their capabilities.</li><br />

<li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnop0CTY0DA">Information: context</a> It is impossible to react to a sign in a way the sign writer intended without being aware of the context of the sign.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=C6LpQx_Qmk0">Information: environment</a> Information systems, signals and signs consume resources such as energy. With dispersed systems it can be difficult to assess which are the best options.</li><br />

<li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dezRyg9H4pc">Information: social states</a> Many signs report or establish a socially defined state. They are performative and declare something to be so and depend on their projection of authority.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=nGTsxBEMHAc">Information: surrogates</a> Some instruments provide information by mimicking the behaviour of something else. Occasional connections are necessary to synchronise the mimic to the imitated.</li><br />

<p>...was quite possibly the least successful sign I ever used when hitch-hiking years and years ago now (with somebody else, it has to be said), but we'd been stuck at Scratchwood services on the M1 for way too long, and we were in need of little light relief from the cars that obviously weren't going to stop anyway... It did raise a few smiles though, which was the desired effect...</p>

<p>Anyway&nbsp; - that phrase came back to me just now as I was listening to the deliciously, politically incorrect High Priest himself, Zodiac Mindwarp, and tinkering with the <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">Openlearnigg</a> CoRank site...</p>

<p>In particular, I've added a link to an RSS feed for each unit (sort of...) to the listings pages...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2067/1762026101_fb58568636.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="285" width="500" /></p>

<p><br />
...and if you click through on a "View course/Join Discussion" link you should end up on a page like this...</p>

<p><br />
What's that I see there? An OpenLearn Unit RSS content feed embedded in a Grazr widget?</p>

<p>Now why would I ever want to go to the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn website</a> again? Heh, heh :-)</p>

<p><small>(Just teasing.... err... maybe... ;-)</small></p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">Openlearnigg</a>.</p>

<p>PS Just as when I was hitching all that time ago, the joke is on me it seems ;-) Grazr seems by default to be (sensibly) limited to feed sizes greater than 512KB, which is smaller than some of the OpenLearn unit content feeds. So there may be a few feeds that don't display properly at the moment... But if I haven't thrown too many toys out of my pram, I'm hopeful that the Grazr folks may up the feed size for feeds rooted on http://openlearn.open.ac.uk ...</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Analytics, Part 2 - When Are Our Students Online?</h3>

<!--
<p>[<a href="#updateCAWhen">UPDATED</a> - with a whole load of qualifying statements and disclaimers!]</p>

<p>Google Analytics offers a couple of views of the same report that might be useful in identifying study patterns - the <em>Visitor trending - Visits</em> report.</p>

<p>(Note these reports are captured over slightly less than the 8 week period mentioned in the previous post.)</p>

<p><h3>Visits - By Date</h3><em>Visits - By Date</em> breaks down the number of visits by date over a particular period. The following snapshot suggests some sort of periodicity as well as "quiet days" during the week - Saturdays, for example, appear <em>not</em> to be popular study days for this cohort, whereas by observation Sunday, Monday and Tuesday are.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/1751654650_1f4752031f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="411" width="500" /></p>

<p>A more rigorous test would be to run this time series data through an autocorrelation function, or some form of spectral analysis, for example, to see whether it is "really" periodic. (But this is a quick blog post, not a formal paper, so here is not the place to run that sort of test... unless anyone knows of a quick'n'easy online tool I can paste my GA data into and get such a report out?)</p>

<p>That said - the report needs to be taken with a pinch of salt (also see <a href="#updateCAWhen">[update]</a> below...). I mentioned in the previous post that the number of unique visitors significantly outnumbers the number of students registered on the course (i.e. the number of people who have access to the course materials): that is, there is a many-to-one mapping from Google unique visitors to students. <em>It's also worth remembering that the course in question requires at least as much study time again on book reading and desktop computer activity...</em></p>

<p>A consideration of data across the whole length of the course also suggests that the periodicity is not so clear cut. There is also a clear "end effect" around the time of the end-of-course assessment, as I will show in the next post on this topic.<br />
<h3>Visits - By Time of Day</h3>Having got a handle (maybe) on what days of the week our students are going online, the next question to ask is what time of day students are logging in to the course materials.</p>

<p><em>Visits - By Time of Day</em> gives just such a report (my analytics settings are set to UK time, so the following should be the "real" time of access for our UK students. (A map overlay (not show) shows that virtually all the students on the course were coming form UK IP addresses.)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2391/1750804869_3433142057.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="430" /></p>

<p>The distribution suggests that&nbsp; we don't have so many night owls, nor a significant number of students studying early in the morning (before work or getting the kids ready for school, for example). Peaks around lunchtime might suggest online study at work (or there again, they might not...), with another bump in the evening between 7pm and 10pm.</p>

<p>A finer grained breakdown, e.g. giving time of day reports for weekdays, Saturday and Sunday, would help to unmask any differences between weekend (i.e. Sunday!) working compared to weekday working.<br />
<h3>Summary</h3>Identfying exactly <em>when</em> distance educations students engage with their studies is always problematic for distance education institutions. The move to online delivery and online study through a controlled website makes it possible to capture this information invisibly, without requiring students to self-complete and return study logs.</p>

<p>Two views of a single Google Analytics report - the Visitor Trending "Visitors" report - allow us to identify study patterns across time of day, and day of week.</p>

<p>Visual observation of reports collected over a two week period hint at patterns of behaviour across the week, with Sunday, Monday and Tuesday being popular study days, and Saturday being unpopular; and throughout the day - lunchtimes and early evening are popular, all night and early morning study unlikely.</p>

<p>[<a name="updateCAWhen">UPDATE</a>: The "Saturday effect" may be completely misleading insofar as it describes how students study the <em>whole</em> of the course... I mentioned that the course includes book reading and use of a desktop application, which are being studied - somewhen; the analytics reported here therefore only relate to the online portion of the course, which correspond to maybe 40% of the time spent on the course... oops... I'll try to focus more on what is maybe safer ground in future posts, and concentrate on what the analytics appears to tell us about <em>just</em> the way the students appear to be interacting with the <em>online</em> materials, at least, without worrying too much about those uncounted students who didn't just print the materials off and study them that way!)]</p>

<p><small>"Confession": maybe not publishing in peer reviewed circles for a bit has led to me losing some of the rigour of academic analysis? A couple of times I've been tempted to write: "-maybe, this is only a blog post after all and not a proper academic publication....", as if that let's me off... Hmm... I wonder how this sits with Martin's thoughts on <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/10/academic-discou.html">Academic Discourse and [Blogging]</a>? Certainly, Grainne Conole's excellent new <a href="http://e4innovation.com/">e4innovation</a> blog is something I would say does tend towards "formal" academic credibility (references 'n' everything ;-)</small><br />

<h3 class="title">Course Analytics, Part 1 - Visitor Behaviour</h3>

<!--
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">Course Analytics - Prequel</a> I set the scene for a couple of posts about student behaviour in an online course, as viewed through a <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> lens.</p>

<p>To clarify things a little further before I start, I'm not really interested at this stage in reporting course grades or identifying individual students who maybe about to drop out, or need some sort of additional support, (although outlier data points may points towards the existence of such individuals). In short I'm not really interested in <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/library/abstract/AcademicAnalytics/45275">Academic Analytics</a>.</p>

<p>For the moment, what I am interested in is how website analytics can be used applied to online course websites in order to gain a better understanding of online study habits and the bahaviour of students taking an online course.</p>

<p>The potential disconnect between this view of <em>online-course analytics</em> and <em>academic analytics</em> is something I may explore later - just not here, and not yet... (That said, finding ways of correlating/reconciling online-course and academic analytics (to create a fusion "elearning analytics"?!) to gain a more comprehensive view of individual performance on the one hand, and course performance in all its senses on the other, would I'm sure be an interesting exercise.)</p>

<p>One final disclaimer - the data shown here is partial data collected as a pilot exercise over the last 8 weeks or so from 10 week, online course, in the context of no other web stats reports.</p>

<p>The course is split into 10 one-week sessions, with assessment in weeks 5 and week 10. The online study materials amount to a nominal 2 to 4 hours of study per week (the course also includes reading from two supplied set books, and completing a series of practical activities using a desktop application, for which instructional material is provided via a set of downloadbale PDF documents and a desktop application launcher.</p>

<p>The intention of the exercise was to gain familiarity of Google Analytics in a familiar context, and identify meaningful course analytics that could inform a course analytics reporting strategy for future presentations of the course, and help identify appropriate conversion "goals" for a course website.</p>

<p>In this post I shall describe several reports relating to general visitor behaviour. In further posts I'll show reports on daily behaviour/weekly cycles, as well as activity surrounding assessment submission dates and user search behaviour from within the course materials.</p>

<p>Data that was not collected includes  - printing behaviour (whether students printed out copies of the online course materials) and outlink click-thru behaviour (whether students followed links to external web resources.</p>

<p>Unique visitors are identified by Google Analytics alone; that is, although individual students logged in to the course using their own credentials, those credentials - or the individual students' login identities - played no part in the collection of the analytics data. As such, we would expect the number of unique visitors over the period to be in excess of the number of students registered on the course if students access the course materials from more than one browser configuration.</p>

<p><h3>Visitor Loyalty</h3>The <em>Visitor Loyalty</em> report describes how often each visitor accessed the course materials over the 8 week data collection period.</p>

<p>The absolute number of unique visitors (not shown) is way in excess of the number of students registered on the course, so this report must be taken with a pinch of salt (the actual number of logins per student over the course period should be obtainable from "offiical" learning system reporting tools).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/1745710516_85396eda43.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="481" width="490" /></p>

<p>The report would seem to indicate that students are accessing the site multiple times (at least 50% of them more than 10 times).</p>

<p>(I actually find the above report confusing - does it read: "Of N visits, the visitors who made those visits visited Number-of-Visits times"? If so, the Number-of-Visits has dimensions "visits per visitor", in which case isn't the Visits divided by the Number-of-Visits the Number-of-Visitors, which should be an integer value?!)</p>

<p><h3>Length of Visit</h3>The <em>Length of Visit</em> report describes the amount of time a visitor spent on the site in a particular session. I would hazard a guess that computers left switched on, mid-session, overnight would report a long length of visit.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2008/1744858419_4b28b1da14.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="306" width="500" /></p>

<p>The distribution suggests that the majority of students are logging in for more than 5 minutes at a time, with a significant proportion spending at least, of the order of, half an hour online.</p>

<p>The granularity of reporting is obviously geared to sites where long sessions are atypical. I need to check whether I can get better resolution data for longer durations/lengths of visit.</p>

<p><h3>Depth of Visit</h3>The <em>Depth of Visit</em> report shows how many pages a visitor accessed on each visit. As with the <em>Length of Visit</em> report, short visits are not so interesting (except insofar as we might wonder what a visitor is doing on a short a visit?!)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/1744857941_44a0d522b2.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="346" /></p>

<p>What is far more interesting is the long tail, and the significant percentage of visits in which students are engaged with the online course materials for a long period of time. As a guide, each week's study is approximately 20 HTML pages of material, accessed from the course index page or course calendar.</p>

<p>Once again, the low resolution reporting for "deep" visits means it works against us, although it is tempting to draw the conclusion that some students might study the week's material in a single session.</p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>The above reports suggest that a significant proportion of students spend a significant amount of time studying the online materials. As a heuristic, designing materials in "chunks" that can be studied within a 30 minute online study session would seem to be reasonable.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/analytics" rel="tag">analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20analytics" rel="tag">course analytics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=42132">Stephen Downes</a> picked up on an <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB6101.pdf">EduCause report on <em>Academic Analytics</em></a>, which "describes how data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling". Academic Analytics can also be used to predict student success, as well as retention.</p>

<p>In this post, I thought I'd set the scene for a series of <em>course analytics</em> posts using data that I "acquired" from an online course earlier this year. (I've posted previously about some of my <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog/010481.html">early thinking on the topic</a>.)</p>

<p>In contrast to the academic analytics, one of the things I set out to explore was how an off the shelf web stats analytics tool (<a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>) could be used to help me learn more about what students were doing with our online course materials, and help me identify what - if anything - a "learning site's" <em>goals</em> could be, and what the site might be optimised for.</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty lies with the site not being a "selling" site. Optimising a mini-site like <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?A02">Study at the OU</a> is in the first instance all about securing registrations on courses. But for an online course, it's not so clear what the goal is, or what the important metrics along the way are.</p>

<p>(I asked a similar question at the Library Strategy workshop a couple of weeks ago: if the library website was Amazon, then success would be measured in taking someone's credit card number, shipping the goods, and not getting them returned. What's the success measure - or success measures - for a library website?)</p>

<p>Something I found useful in helping me think about this topic was this seminar on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgXDUuAK77M">Google Analytics - Non-Ecommerce Sites: Beyond Averages</a> from the <a href="Google%20Conversion%20University">Google Conversion University Playlist on YouTube</a> (the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/conversionuniversity.html">Google Conversion University website</a> also has some interesting articles...).</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LgXDUuAK77M"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LgXDUuAK77M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>In particular, here are four <em>distribution</em> (rather than average) measures that are useful for analysing user behaviour on non-ecommerce websites:<br />
<ul><li>Visitor loyalty - how often has each user visited the site over a given period;</li><br />
<li>Visitor recency - of all the people who have visited the site, how many have visited in the last N days;</li><br />
<li>Length of visit - how long do visitors stay on site;</li><br />
<li>Depth of visit - how many pages on the site are seen on each visit;</li></ul></p>

<p>Over the next week or so, I'll do a series of posts looking at these measures as obtained from an online course, and go way beyond reports like this...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2117/1727702520_4a4d90c605.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="348" width="500" />  </p>

<p>That said - there are a couple of interesting features in the above report - periodicity, for example (Tuesday's look busy...), and traffic peaks at the two assessment weeks...</p>

<p><small>PS Just by the by, if you use consultants to do your reading for you (i.e. you read through reports or sit through presentations that talk-up <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause-Great/dp/0875845851/?tag=ouseful-21">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustaining-Successful/dp/1578518520/?tag=ouseful-21">Solution</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190/?tag=ouseful-21">Blue Ocean Strategies</a> and so on) I'm guessing that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Competing-Analytics-Thomas-H-Davenport/dp/1422103323/?tag=ouseful-21">Competing on Analytics</a> will be the next "bestselling" Harvard Business School book they quote at you!

<h3 class="title">OpenLearnigg - Social Ranking for OpenLearn Units</h3>

Some time ago, I came across CoRank, which is not a hosted Digg-clone, (but it is, really...;-). Over the last week or so, I've been using an RSS import facility (available on request from corank) to populate http://openlearnigg.corank.com with links...

<p>Some time ago, I came across <a href="http://www.corank.com">CoRank</a>, which is not a hosted Digg-clone, (but it is, really...;-). Over the last week or so, I've been using an RSS import facility (available on request from corank) to populate <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">http://openlearnigg.corank.com</a> with links to OpenLearn Units (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007457.html">Time for an OpenLearnigg (sic) Environment</a> for my earlier doodles on this topic).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2078/1710833805_60779ad082.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="319" width="500" /></p>

<p>CoRank supports topic based and tagged classification, so I've mirrored the OpenLearn topic structure, and also added a handful of tags to each post (by hand! Ideally, this would be done automatically using some sort of  term extraction or content analysis tool).</p>

<p>I've set the permissions up so that:<br />
<ol><li>anyone can vote;</li><br />
<li>registered users can comment;</li><br />
<li>only I can add tags (I think) and new links.</li></ol><br />
All the links point back to the corresponding unit on the OpenLearn site.</p>

<p>Having got access access to al the template files (again - <a href="http://corank.zoomblog.com/archive/2007/08/30/one-more-step-towards-complete-customi.html">available on request</a>).</p>

<p>On the to do list template hacking wise is the addition of feed URLs for each unit, and then maybe a Grazr embedded feed view of the content from each unit.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking of collecting links to the MIT opencourseware units, agian by piping them in via <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/rss/index.htm">MIT OCW course listings RSS</a>.</p>

<p>TechCrunch are reporting that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/19/flickr-to-add-photo-editing-tool-via-picnik/">Flickr [is] To Add Online Photo Editing Tools Via Picnik</a>, which strikes me as a Good Thing... I also wonder if it's an opportunity for extending the reach of the OU short course course <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">T189 Digital photography: creating and sharing better images</a>.<br />
<blockquote>[T189] is a creative mix of practice, learning, sharing and reflection:</p>

<p>    * Practice: each week you do a practical photographic activity that broadens and strengthens your photographic experience. Together these activities form the basis of your portfolio that youll draw upon for your end-of-course assessment.</p>

<p>    * Learning: each week you learn about different aspects of photographic techniques, as well as relevant aspects of the technology behind digital photography.</p>

<p>    * Sharing and reflection: each week you share your work within the T189 online community of photographers. You'll steadily develop your ability to reflect upon your own and others' work, and to write about your increasing visual awareness.</blockquote>There are <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/photo+editor">many online photo editing tools</a> of course, and Adobe will soon be releasing an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/adobe_preparing_full_shift_to_online_apps.php">online version of Photoshop</a> (T189 trains students in the use of Adobe Photoshop Elements, which is provided free with the course, I believe) so the Flickr announcement is not necessarily offering a <em>new</em> service, although it does potentially open up a new audience for T189? </p>

<p>I don't know if anyone has explored a partnership with Flickr or Photobucket or even the Goog (in the context of Picasa) for T189, but the opportunity of doing a daily learning, or one-topic-per-visit version of the course in the context of a photo-hosting and editing site would seem to me to be a natural fit? And a natural place to offer a <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge</a> course on digital photography?</p>

<p>Opening up new revenue streams for our courses is something that I think is on the agenda as UK HE funding continues to undergo something of a review. Licensing Relevant Knowledge short courses to sites that provide an appropriate context for them might provide one way of extending their reach, and the revenue we can generate from them?<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/flickr" rel="tag">flickr</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/t189" rel="tag">t189</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digital%20photography" rel="tag">digital photography</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/relevant%20knowledge" rel="tag">relevant knowledge</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">RSS Content Analysis, Tag Clouds and OpenLearn Navigation</h3>

<!--
<p>Last week, I came across a service - <a href="http://www.jiglu.com/">Jiglu</a> - that claimed to "automatically create intelligent tags and links for your web content". One of the things I've been exploring lately is the potential for constructing thematic bundles of OpenLearn course units - as more and more units are added to the current OpenLearn topics, their usefulness as containers that support discovery through browsing becomes debatable...</p>

<p>So the Jiglu service looked interesting this respect; unfortunately, it seems that you need to add a Javascript snippet to the pages you want to analyse, which I don't have access to on OpenLearn (I didn't check this - maybe the javascript is just required for presentaion and you can find a API URL in the code?)</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://zoomclouds.egrupos.net/">ZoomClouds</a> - the tag cloud service I use on <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful Info</a> - only requires an RSS feed URL in order for you to benefit from <em>it's</em> content analysis and term extraction service, so I dutifully set up a demo.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is a cloud generated from the unit feed from <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1710">M248_1 Exploring data: graphs and numerical summaries</a> (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openLearnTagCloudDemo.html">see demo tag cloud</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/1660780178_450115c553.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="168" width="218" /></p>

<p>As far as I know, ZoomClouds doesn't offer an API for creating new ZoomClouds, although the <a href="http://clouds.zoomblog.com/archivo/2006/02/27/zoomclouds-Api.html">ZoomCLouds API</a>does publish an XML feed containing the tags extracted from a feed, so generating a ZoomCloud for each of the dozens and dozens of OpenLearn Units that are now available would be tedious, to say the least!</p>

<p>What might be more interesting could be to generate a single, spliced feed of several OpenLearn units - maybe even all the units in an OpenLearn topic area, or at least all the descriptions of courses in a topic area - and generate a navigational tag cloud that links into the course descriptions, rather than the sections within an individual course.</p>

<p>Ahh - what the heck - let's see how that might look. Let's take the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/filter.php?grouping=topic&amp;detail=10">feed of unit descriptions for the OpenLearn Science and Nature topic</a>, for example:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2247/1660779966_eb4dd613da.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="207" /><br />
<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openLearnTagCloudDemo.html">See demo tag cloud</a>.</p>

<p>As OpenLearn provides access to more and more units, supporting discovery of relevant content is going to become more and more of an issue. The use of ZoomClouds shows one possible approach to automating the generation of navigational widgets on the basis of content analysis, In a later post, I'll write up a tag based approach I've been exploring in the context of a Digg-like interface to OpenLearn - <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">OpenLearnigg</a>.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tagcloud" rel="tag">tagcloud</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/content%20analysis" rel="tag">content analysis</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/navigation" rel="tag">navigation</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>After a month or so of teasing, the first major push of our skunkworks <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=06d85b85540794e2fd02e9ef83206bf6">OU Course Profiles</a> Facebook app went live yesterday. Since mid-September, we've been quietly running an application on Facebook that allows OU students to declare the OU courses they've taken, are taking or intend to take. Until yesterday, the app provided a course badge panel on a user's profile page...</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/1640856721_ce898f1c06.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="278" width="486" /></p>

<p>... and announced courses added to their profile on their news feed...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2301/1641729824_7482870cd6.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="83" width="412" /></p>

<p>Courses are added to a profile using a course code. One of the motivations for the app was the observation that many students self-declare courses they have been involved with in the signature to their online conference postings. OU students often take just one or two courses per year over 7 month period, studying at a distance and often on top of the pressure of work and family commitments. Under such a regime, the course code often becomes unforgettable!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/1640854279_184a593719.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="330" width="500" /></p>

<p>The course title is pulled in from a database of course codes and titles. Whilst this data <em>can</em> be scraped from the OU courses and qualifications website (at least for currently presented courses), we managed to obtain <em>a</em> list of course codes from an internal OU database to drive the title auto-completion code from the start; more recently, an authoritative list of course codes and titles has been obtained.</p>

<p>Part of the philosophy of the development team (myself, <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=33">Stuart Brown</a> (comms) and Liam Green-Hughes  (AACS; thanks for all your development effort, Liam :-), with <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/10/first-ou-facebo.html">Martin Weller</a> riding shotgun and covering our backs) was that the application should not make use of privileged OU information; that is, we would only use information that is available on (scrapeable from!) the OU's public websites, or that is self-declared by application users.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of efficiency(!?;-), we decided we <em>would</em> exploit data such as course code and title tables if by doing so we could make an argument to the data holders that they really should publish a public API of the information, and that we could demonstrate a sensible use case for it.</p>

<p>That said, where data has been made available to us, we have reserved the right <em>not</em> use any data we are provided with until such a time as we can make use of it via a public API, even if this means we use lower quality data.</p>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>

<p>The new features released yesterday start to exploit various network related properties, as well as exploring integration with OU related services that are <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010591.html">keyed using a course code</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>View Course Information</em> panel currently links through to the 'external'  OU courses and qualifications code for that course (where it exists). However, we are exploring ways in which we might link to the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/occam/courseinfo.asmx">OU's XCRI web service</a> (SOAP, rather than RESTful with a JSON output option, unfortunately...) as and when course level details are made available through it. </p>

<p>The <em>OpenLearn Units</em> panel links through to a page that lists any OpenLearn Units derived from that particular course and links through to the corresponding units on the OpenLearn site. (Although we are not using this service, the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=eBdDcNdm3BGw5cCHy6ky6g">OpenLearn Units Derived from an OU Course</a> Yahoo! Pipe could be used to source this data.)</p>

As the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010778.html">OpenLearn Units in Facebook</a> app demonstrates, a Grazr widget can be used to display any number of OpenLearn Units in Facebook by making use of the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/index.php">OpenLearn Unit RSS Feeds</a>. Embedding of OpenLearn unit feeds in this panel is being explored. </p>

<p>The <em>Friends on This Course</em> link provides a list of friends who have declared their association with - or interest in - the same course, subject to appropriate privacy settings. Privacy has been one of our ongoing concerns, about which I'll write more in a later post (along with some notes on the development process behind the app).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2067/1641730120_134dfa68e8.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="221" width="500" /></p>

<p>The <em>Course Comments</em> feature started out as a Facebook comment wall, although we have since instituted a custom built wall. Whilst this means we host the comments and are in a sense responsible for them, it does mean we can remove a comment if it is flagged to us as offensive or abusive by application users.</p>

<p>The <em>Find A Study Buddy</em> feature starts to leverage the <em>course code declaration network</em> that we are beginning to map out. When a users tries to find a Study Buddy for a course, other users who have declared the same course, and whose privacy settings allow an introduction to be made to the user looking for a Study Buddy, are listed. A message can then be sent via the application to the potential Study Buddy.</p>

<p>A ranking algorithm <em>is</em> used by the Study Buddy finder tool, although you'll have to wait for a later post to find out more about it;-)</p>

<p>A further social tool is the ability to <em>recommend</em> a course to a friend. As well as promoting the application, there are obvious potential marketing benefits to the OU here (it would be handy if the OU offered an affiliate scheme, so we could get a percentage if anyone signed up to a course as a result a Couse Profiles app recommendation?;-).</p>

<p><em>However</em>, our intention has <em>not</em> been to develop a marketing tool - as a skunkworks team, we have been more interested in exploring the potential for cross-unit, agile application development (working on the <a href="">outside, inside</a>!) and the possibility of leveraging both the Facebook social network, and our users' self-declared OU course codes network, as a way of building OU student communities.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are approximately 3,500 members of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/networks/?nk=16827259">Open University Network</a> on Facebook, and about 800 in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2212434521">Open University Group</a> (which is the group I believe Facebook users who cannot join the OU Network (no *.open.ac.uk email address, I guess?) but who do want to participate in a general OU community, align themselves with).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=06d85b85540794e2fd02e9ef83206bf6">OU Course Profiles</a> application has  - as of 19/10/07 - almost 300 users, growing at several(?!) a day. It will be interesting to see how the app propagates through these two communities over the coming weeks, and whether anyone finds it OUseful ;-)</p>

<p>PS You'll notice that we called the application "Course Profiles" rather than "Open University Course Profiles". That's because it scales... if you want to know more, mail me...</p>

<p>PPS as well as adding OU course codes to the app, you can also add OpenLearn unit codes. So if you're interested in a particular OpenLearn unit, add the course unit code to your profile and see who else is interested :-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/skunkworks" rel="tag">skunkworks</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">A Really Simple Question About &lt;embed&gt;</h3>

In Reusing Third Party Materials, Not...? I asked the question:[J]ust how we might make use of online, third party materials ... because as far as I can tell, "open content" licenses don't really lubricate the process of reusing such materials...
<!--
<p>In <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog/010602.html">Reusing Third Party Materials, Not...?</a> I asked the question:<blockquote>[J]ust how we might make use of online, third party materials ... because as far as I can tell, "open content" licenses don't really lubricate the process of reusing such materials within our own courses, behind closed paywalls at all...</blockquote></p>

<p>I was at a meeting yesterday discussing this issue, and there's something about the rights clearance, permission soliciting and granting process that I just don't get*.</p>

<p>So here's one question that comes to mind - what's implied and commonly understood by an &lt;embed&gt; code?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2356/1598480814_10ac65208b.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="212" width="317" /></p>

<p>Who do I have to be to be able to take that code and just use it <em>without asking anyone</em>? Yes - I know - in the above case, the <a href="http://youtube.com/t/terms">YouTube Terms and Conditions</a> will tell me... ;-)</p>

<p>Who's responsible for ensuring that the content can be embedded and who's liable for any impropriety if the material is used subject to the license conditions on the page from which the embed code was obtained?</p>

<p>If the end user always has to clear rights, down the chain, widespread re-use of content won't happen - it's far too complicated...</p>

<p>I guess what I'm after is a clearing house, where the end user accepts the license from the page the embed code is originally made available on, and trusts that all rights <em>upstream</em> have been cleared as long as license conditions on the page the embed code was obtained from are honoured <em>downstream</em>.</p>

<p>In particular, I'm thinking of a clearing house for academic use - like <a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/">Jorum</a> [UPDATE: maybe not - <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2007/07/jorum-very-very-10.html">"Why I won't be using Jorum"</a> - thanks AJ...] or <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/">Intute</a>, I guess? (Intute is interesting - if I link to a 3rd party website, my rights department will want to check that I'm using the link appropriately under the Terms and Conditions of the site I'm linking to. If I pull that link in from Intute, will they still want to check? Or do we assume that because the link is pulled via Intute, all's okay?)</p>

<p>[UPDATE: Stephen Downes (correctly;-) points out how rubbish a central repository is, and remind me of his <a href="http://www.downes.ca/files/DDRM_14April2004.doc">"OpenID for DRM"</a> model. What I was struggling with was how to avoid the need for repeated rights confirmation by different end users in the same sector. I guess if a digital object has had rights clearance checked by one institution, and these clearance credentials are acceptable directly by other institutions, then the okay only has to be achieved once, and then on the way out (so only resources that someone wants to use get cleared...]</p>

<p>Why should education get this favoured treatment, anyway, of <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/10/understanding-me.html">commercially hoarding</a> other people's work and saving ourselves the cost and trouble of producing it ourselves? Because I believe that the <em>learner</em> should have to put some effort in too, to get value from the material that is being used in the learning context.</p>

<p>I don't really hold with students as customers, buying enlightenment. If they <em>are</em> customers, then yes, educational institutions should pay for every scrap of 3rd party material we draw on. But if they are <em>students</em>, and they need to put their own effort in for the learning payoff, then our use of the 3rd party content is one of the ways we're helping them create their personal skills and knowledge structures. And we're helping the students unlock value from the 3rd party materials for themselves by putting those materials in some sort of context... We're not taking 3rd party ingredients, baking a cake, and handing it to our customers (if we were, we should pay for those ingredients); we're looking for sample ingredients that we can help our students learn to make their own cakes with...  Maybe... I'm a bit out of my depth on this one!</p>

<p>* I do now, I think... Note to self - our rights department <em>check</em> that we are using 3rd party materials under the Terms and Conditions they are made available by. As course authors, we are not responsible. Wherever we get material from, Rights will want to check the usage rights. Maybe one day, rights clearance can be automated by making use of something like <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP">license information specified in XMP</a>. Using CC material does not simplify the rights process - the rights will still need checking <em>by someone else with the authority to sign off on them...</em>.</p>

<p>PS for anyone commenting on OpenLearn units or uploading content to <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn LabSpace</a>, be sure to take note of the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=15">Terms and Conditions</a>, which state:<br />
<blockquote>6.6 You may not through any submitted content create a hypertext link to a third party's website (home page, web page or documents contained within) without the prior consent in writing of us and the third party in question.</blockquote></p>

<p>Just as a matter of public record, I assume that <em>written permission</em> has been obtained for every link to every external website that is mentioned in all the course materials on OpenLearn, as well as any links to third party content mentioned in unit comments?</p>

<p>PS In '<a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/10/understanding-me.html">Understanding Me</a>', Stephen Downes reflects on the nature of open content licences, which is relevant to this topic, I think...</p>

<p>PPS this industry promoted declaration of <a href="http://www.ugcprinciples.com/index.html">Copyright Principles for User Generated Content Services</a> is also worth a look (via <a href="http://b2fxxx.blogspot.com/2007/10/content-cos-agree-copyright-principles.html">Ray Corrigan</a>:-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/creativecommons" rel="tag">creativecommons</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/licensing" rel="tag">licensing</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>In a post about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010569.html">OU Regional Offices on Google Maps</a>, I demoed an <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=http:%2F%2Fwww.open.ac.uk%2Fgoogle-earth%2Fthe-open-university-uk-all-regions.kmz&ie=UTF8&z=6&om=1">official OU regional offices map</a>, along with an unofficial Yahoo mapmixer map that overlaid an OU campus map onto a Yahoo map.</p>

<p>On that note, Stuart Brown recently posted a YouTube movie that the comms team put together showing a Walton Hall campus tour.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to add embedded Youtube movies to the pop-up boxes associated with push-pins on Google maps, so I added the tour to my <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&z=16&om=1">interactive OU campus map</a>.</p>

<p>Although I haven't been keeping up with new stuff in photography for last the couple of weeks(?!) - the last lookaround I did was when I started assembling the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010527.html">Future of Photogrpahy</a> video compilation - it struck me that there was a whole raft of tools out there that I could see estate agents (realtors?) making use of in the coming years...</p>

<p>So here's a quick roundup...</p>

<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=l7lzDG6nTUE">3D animated room tours</a> from <a href="http://www.3dplanview.com/">3DPlanView</a>.<br />
 <br />

<p>For viewing the outside the property in 3d, all you need is a  photo - <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=nPt7GmIpXo8">Fotowoosh version Alpha</a> from <a href="http://fotowoosh.com">fotowoosh</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Another 2D to 3D mapping comes from <a href="http://www.metropix.co.uk/mtpix/index.aspx">Metropix</a>, which allows you to create 3D walkthroughs from 2D floor plans. I couldn't find an embeddable video demo, so you'll have to <a href="http://www.metropix.co.uk/mtpix/walkthroughs.aspx">try here</a>.</p>

<p>Getting measurements is always likely to be problematic - so how about using a photo to get your measurements: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ShhxxAEPRjU">iphotomeasure tutorial</a> from <a href="http://www.iphotomeasure.com/">iphotomeasure</a></p>

<p>Decorating the room can be done with somethign like the <a href="http://www.designmyroom.com/">Design My Room</a> <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/centernetworks/videos/58/">room decorating tool</a></p>

<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/58f4a318/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/58f4a318/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler" ></embed></object></p>

<p>On a similiar theme is <a href="http://www.scenecaster.com/">Scenecaster</a>, which allows you to reuse models form the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse">Google Sketchup 3D model warehouse</a>as <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Z8CYzLnULnY">this movie shows</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need to check local information about a property of course - <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/">UpMyStreet</a> is a good place to satrt, as are <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/">Google mapplets</a> - check out the <a href="http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/2007/06/27/nestoria-uk-property-search-google-mapplet/">Nestoria mapplet</a> to get a feel for what's possible.</p>

<p>You'll probably also want to keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/apihowto.php">planning notices</a>, and then maybe consider online conveyancing, e.g. using things like <a href="http://www.landregisteronline.gov.uk/lro/index.html">Land Registry online</a>.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/estateagents" rel="tag">estateagents</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Last night, I came across a really simple recipe for <a href="http://gathadams.com/2007/06/18/how-to-write-a-facebook-application-in-10-minutes/">writing a facebook app in 10 minutes</a> last night, and was pleased to find it actually takes less than that, once you get your eye in.</p>

<p>The app builder is not really an app builder, as such, it's a recipe for embedding a webpage in an iframe with an applications "canvas" page on Facebook (<em>not</em> the actual profile page), very much in the style of <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, to get things started, here's an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=ec265cfb01504408c7b751bcb1098d3c">OpenLearn Course Units</a> facebook app. Add it to your Facebook profile and you can read the content of <em>every</em> <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> unit via the unit RSS feeds, which are bundled using my own <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010577.html">OpenLearn OPML bundles</a>.</p>

<p>Having cracked the recipe, it was easy enough to build some other apps:<br />

<h3 class="title">My RadiOBU Confusion...</h3>

Earlier today, I got tipped off to an Open2.net/OU programme listing feed (which I have vague memories of being told about, but don't recall having seen on the Open2.net site, where it should really be autodiscoverable on every page ;-)...
<!--
<p>Earlier today, I got tipped off to an <a href="http://open2.net/feeds/rss_schedule.xml">Open2.net/OU programme listing feed</a> (which I have vague memories of being told about, but don't recall having seen on the Open2.net site, where it should really be autodiscoverable on <em>every</em> page ;-)</p>

<p>What this means is I can now use something like <a href="http://30boxes.com">30 boxes</a> to get a calendar interface to the listings, and probably also generate an iCal feed easily enough (what would be handy would be to have the programme listing available in a Google calendar...).</p>

<p>(Just in passing, <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/06/30-boxes-and-the-facebook-revolution/">30Boxes calendars can be added to a Facebook profile...</a>.)</p>

<p>Digging around the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> site, I also found a handful of podcast feeds: for <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/podcasts.html">Ever Wondered About Food</a>, <a href="http://www.open2.net/thingsweforgot/podcast.html">The Things We Forgot To Remember</a>, <a href="http://www.open2.net/weekendbreak/index.html">Weekend Break</a> and <a href="http://www.open2.net/society/education/talking_languages_podcast/index.html">Talking Languages</a>, in fact.</p>

<p>It was trivial to add these to a Grazr reading list using the new <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010585.html">Grazr 2.0 drag'n'drop reading list interface</a>, along with a current podcast feed from the Material World website on the BBC Radio 4 website (Material World is another programme that the OBU (the Open Broadcasting Unit) have a hand in producing.</p>

<p>I also added an 'enriched' Click On bookmark feed using a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010401.html">feed enrichment pipe</a> that augments a delicious  RSS feed with media attachments, in this case a link to a <em>ram</em> (Real Audio) stream - many widgets (such as Grazr) will embed an appropriate player if they find a media enclosure in  a feed, so you can play it without having to leave the widget at all.</p>

<p>Stumbling across some Reith Lecture pages, I bookmarked the Real Audio feeds to delicious with some appropriate tags to seed a couple of Reith Lecture "channels" too.</p>

<p>(I need to do a new pipe that generates the <em>ram</em> enclosure URL automatically from a bookmarked webpage on the BBC website, <em>assuming</em> an appropriate URL mapping exists, of course!)</p>

<p>So here's a link to my <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0">RadiOBU Grazr Widget</a>:</p>

<div style="height: 350px; width: 300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0"></script></div>

<p>And here's where confusion sets it... How, why and if at all is this interesting? (I've doodled around this before, in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009962.html">What's on the Web RadiOU?</a>.)</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I put together an OU SplashCast player containing several OU related channels (I'll add some radio ones when I get a chance). And as I put together more OBU related programmes, I'll add them to that channel and this RadiOBU ("radio, boo") widget. But so what?</p>

<p>I'm starting to feel as if I've found lots of OU broadcast related jigsaw pieces (including some from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006117.html">BBC Programme Catalogue</a>), but I've no idea whether they can be put together in a compelling way?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, here are couple more bits of confetti that are muddling my thinking further, both from meetings today:<br />
<ul><li>an interest in our new department to produce regular "podcast" material for our department website. My impression was that this could be something like <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> rather than <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a>, a short form <a href="http://talk.talis.com/">Talking With Talis</a> rather than <a href="http://www.twit.tv/twit">TWiT</a>, but we'll have to wait and see...</li><li>"traditional production models rule, okay?" - a takeaway for me today from a course team meeting for a course that will start in 2010, is that we invest a <em>huge</em> amount of effort in course production, but very little in exploiting OBU productions, particularly radio. IMHO, the recent series of <a href="http://www.open2.net/clickon/index.html">Click On</a> could be used as the basis of an interesting magazine website, with content to wrap the "listen againable" programmes, and suitably selected and filtered news feeds providing fresh content to keep the pages up-to-date without human intervention. I started to explore this in the context of Click On series 1 some time ago: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On in Context</a>. Of course, OBU already do this to a certain extent (if you need a Netvibes tutorial, why not point pople to the <a href="http://www.open2.net/sciencetechnologynature/computing/web2workshop/personal_portals.html">Click On Web2.0 Workshop</a>, for example?) but we donlt exploit OBU material at a departmental publicity level.</li></ul></p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a> is putting out more and more content <em>all the time</em>, and yet I get the feeling we don't really have much idea about how we can <em>really</em> start to exploit its publicity-through-use value alongside the public service education payoff.</p>

<p>Maybe it will all become clear to me in the morning...</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: because it was so easy to do, I created a proof-of-concept <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5230153497">RadiOBU Facebook application</a> that allows you to listen to RadiOBU from a Facebook application canvas page.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/obu" rel="tag">obu</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20OU" rel="tag"> OU</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20broadcast" rel="tag"> broadcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Whilst having a little look around for sites that explore the "mood of the web" last night, I came across <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/MoodViews/">MoodViews</a>, "a collection of tools for tracking the stream of mood-annotated text made available by LiveJournal."</p>

<p>I'm not a LiveJournal user, but it seems that when you post to LiveJournal, you can associate a mood icon with it - <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/moodlist.bml">LiveJournal Moods - Mood Theme Previews</a>.</p>

<p>The MoodViews app aggregates this information to produce a mood of the web report.  Some of the 'moods' show periodicity:</p>

<p><img src="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/MoodViews/Moodgrapher/CyclicEvents/awake.graph.png" alt="moodview - periodicity"/></p>

<p>Some anticipate forthcoming events:</p>

<p><img src="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/MoodViews/Moodgrapher/GlobalEvents/christmas2005-excited.png" alt="moodview - christmas excitement" /></p>

<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006260.html">Google Trends</a> in search terms also reveal similar dynamic features - when do you think people search for <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=toys">toys</a> for example, or <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=equinox">equinox</a>?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/MoodViews/Moodsignals/">MoodSignals</a> service is partuicularly interesting - large changes in mood can be seen to correspond to particular events.</p>

<p>It'd be interesting to see how well these Mood Signals correlate to particular events as signalled by changes in particular Google searches using Google trends?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think either service offers an API at the moment?</p>

<p>PS what I meant to mention in this post was how the MoodView scanning approach could be extended out from Live Journal to other status services, like Facebook or Twitter. Prompted buy: Andy Powell commenting on using Twitter to update Facebook status entries - <a href="http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/10/andy-is.html">Andy is...</a></p>

<!--
<p>Chatting earlier today around an app in development (that we're not talking about in public yet, Martin... ;-), we started thinking about mood profiles and how we might capture mood information. One approach we discussed was to use a simple mood slider.</p>

<p>What feels like an age ago, I posted about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010355.html">Facebook News Mixing Desk</a>, which provided a list of sliders that let you blend the mix of news items appearing in your Facebook news feed.</p>

<p>A quick dig around today turned up the following application on the Walmart website, of all places, where a range of sliders are used to describe how you're feeling as the basis for a movie recommendation: <a href="http://mediadownloads.walmart.com/mmce/jsp/movieMatch.jsp?filter_levels=100,1,120,20,40,110">Walmart Movie Match</a></p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/1544855930_c4cf807235.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="495" width="500" /></p>

<p>The search doesn't seem to work that well (some of the movies dominate some of the mood components), but the idea is an interesting one.</p>

<p>The interface actually reminds me of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/gsl/search/finder/002-1527640-2908837?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;productGroupID=loose%5Fdiamonds">Amazon Diamond Search</a>; here, sliders are used to limit various diamond options, such as the price, cut, or size of the diamond</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/1544915518_cf2d89bf7f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="486" width="500" /></p>

<p>A long time ago I doodled on paper a rotary switch style interface for white goods selection, that allowed you to set a median price point and power efficiency, and then use a simple vector calculation to rank the results. Maybe I should have another look at that, one day?!</p>

<p>Finally, whilst on the topic of slider interfaces, <a href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo MindSet</a> is another I'm aware of; this allows you to shape the ranking of results from Yahoo based on whether you are doing research or shopping...</p>

<p>I haven't really been keeping up with visual search engines, but here's where I tend to bookmark them to: <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/visual+search">http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/visual+search</a><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/slider" rel="tag">slider</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/UX" rel="tag">UX</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20user%20interface" rel="tag"> user interface</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20UI" rel="tag"> UI</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20user%20experience" rel="tag"> user experience</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I don't know about you, but my bank uses my birthday as one of the ways to find out that I am really me... which is why I try to be wary about posting my real birthday on public profiles.</p>

<p>However, many people <em>do</em> like to declare their birthday on their MySpace or Facebook profile, so how about this: we take a lead from the Queen and have <em>two</em> birthdays - one on the anniversary of our birth, and <em>another one</em>, that we announce on our public web profiles?</p>

<p>I mentioned the idea to Brian Kelly earlier this week, and he was in all in favour of it, suggesting that our <em>web</em>, <em>internet</em>, or just plan old <em>public birthday</em> might correspond to the date we first logged on... I'm not sure I can remember that far back, though..</p>

<p>On Friday, I was at an OU Library Futures workshop, scoping areas and issues for Library strategy and planning to 2012. (As at ILI2007, I'm not sure how well it goes down when I mention the things Google and the other public web search engines can do? ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the things that I'd said was how broken the OU search engines seems to be, at times, which was why I tend to search the public OU pages using <em>site:</em> limits (knowing subdomains can help, here ;-) and some of the other internal search engines.</p>

<p>I did promise to a colleague that I'd try and pull out some examples of where Google maybe more effective than our own search engine (like this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010430.html">classic example</a>, for example;-), but I'm way behind on things to do this week already, so I built a little tool that hopefully encourage some others to post their favourite OU search engine failures ;-)</p>

<p>All it is, is a side by side display of OU search results and Google search results limited to the <em>open.ac.uk</em> domain. I probably should have produced a Google Custom search engine with a few refinements, e.g. to mirror the tabs on the OU search results page, but that's left for another coffee break (or as an exercise for the reader, maybe?)</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2109/1531363459_7f7eaec8c5.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="323" width="500" />  </p>

<p>...and here's a link: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ousearchways.php">OU and Google "site:open.ac.uk" searches, side-by-side</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to bookmark searches, there's a simple "URL API" of sorts; for example, here's a search on <em>search engine</em>: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ousearchways.php?q=search%20engine">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ousearchways.php?q=search%20engine</a>.</p>

<p>PS for any new readers of this blog from ILI2007, that's a good example of a throwaway, twenty minute app I get the urge to build and post about most days  via <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.Info</a>  ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/quality" rel="tag">quality</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I've just got back from a very enjoyable couple of days at <a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/index.shtml">Internet Librarian International (ILI2007)</a>, where I spoke about <em>search hubs</em> and custom search engines.</p>

<p>It was interesting that Phil Bradley, search engine aficionado and the closing keynote speaker also picked up on custom search engines as one of the technologies that the library and info professional crowd should go and have a  play with.</p>

<p>Chatting to a member of the OpenLearn team last week, a comment was made about the state of OpenLearn search. I have to admit, I don't search the site directly that often, though when I do it's often via a Grazr widget that consumes a feed from a Dapper application that scrapes the results from the OU search results page (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009224.html">Search OpenLearn Anywhere</a>).</p>

<p>It would be handy if the OU search engine produced an <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Home">OpenSearch</a> feed, but then again, maybe working on the results quality would be handy too.</p>

<p>Anyway, it didn't take long at all to produce a Google Custom Search over the OpenLearn domain, with refinements to let you tunnel in to results from the unit descriptions, unit content, unit forums, and so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2220/1514118014_583ef4739f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="277" width="500" /></p>

<p>[I've added a "feeds" limit since I too that screenshot which also lets you refine the search results to just contain feed URLs.]</p>

<p>I haven't produced a skin or landing page for the app yet, but you can try it here: <a href="http://google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3Augr-oyrmt-4">OpenLearn CSE Demo</a>.</p>

<p><script src="http://gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://google.com/coop/api/009190243792682903990/cse/ugr-oyrmt-4/gadget&amp;synd=open&amp;w=320&amp;h=75&amp;title=OpenLearn+Search&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;output=js"></script></p>

<p>I'm not sure that a topic based search would be that useful? At the moment, I think that units are allocated to one and only one topic area, which for a subject like <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2504">Babylonian Mathematics</a> is confusing (is it a Maths unit or a an Arts and History one?).</p>

<p>PS I notice that the OpenLearn topic feeds appear to be capped at twenty items, which means they don't necessarily list all the units in a topic?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20cse" rel="tag"> cse</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Anyone who watched the <a href="http://youtube.com/theopenuniversity">OU on YouTube</a> show on the SplashCast channel I posted to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010630.html">Fond Memories of Late Night OU TV Programmes, Relived</a> may well have been taken aback to see this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34pf9U_XxMw">Lab Rats movie</a>, which represents something of a new wave in OU film-making, I think!</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/34pf9U_XxMw"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/34pf9U_XxMw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Apparently, "there is interest in finding OU academics who might like to do short promos for new or existing courses".</p>

<p>So if any internal readers are interested, get in touch with <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/">comms</a> (my fee is the normal 10% ;-)</p>

<p>TechCrunch reported today that UC Berkeley have been putting a wide selection of their lectures up on YouTube: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/03/uc-berkeley-puts-courses-on-youtube/#comment-1658154">UC Berkeley Puts Courses On YouTube</a>, though <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/2007/10/bored-at-berkeley.html">AJ</a> isn't much impressed...</p>

<p>I was intrigued as to whether it's possible to search videos by user on YouTube and get the result via a feed using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html#SearchingVideosKeywords">YouTube/GData API</a>, and it's easy... For example: <a href="http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/videos?q=skeletal+biology&amp;author=ucberkeley">http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/videos?q=skeletal+biology&amp;author=ucberkeley</a>.</p>

<p>Using a simple bit of <a href="http://docs.grazr.com/script/tutorial/">GrazrScript</a>, it doesn't take much to build a little search widget around this feed, that you could then embed in your own page.</p>

<p>To make things a little more interesting, though, I also added a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?query=biology+skeletal&amp;_cmd=Run+Pipe&amp;_id=yGlMnlty3BGax5jTCB2yXQ&amp;_run=1">feed embellishment via a Yahoo Pipe</a> that adds the movie as an enclosure to the feed so that it can be played directly within the Grazr widget (scroll down on the result in the widget... the embedded player may look a little broken at first, but it works fine if you click on it).</p>

<p>So here it is: <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=3p&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/ucberkeleyYoutubeVideoSearch.opml">UCB Video search via Grazr</a></p>

<p><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=3p&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/ucberkeleyYoutubeVideoSearch.opml"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1099/1482965186_22e080d09d.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="420" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I maybe need to look around YouTube to see if there are any more universities putting their content up there.</p>

<p>If you know of any, feel free to add them in a comment.</p>

<p>PS add the UC Berkeley lecture search tool to Facebook with this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6118334781">UCB Video Lecture Search Facebook App</a> <br />

<p>Looking at the OU and OpenLearn presence on Youtube just now (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity">OU on YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openlearn">OpenLearn on YouTube</a>), it struck me that the days of stumbling across OU programmes in the early hours of the morning could well be here again...</p>

<p>I currently have a Mogulus channel streaming techie programmes 24 hours a day, including through my FaceBook page, and it would be easy enough to do the same thing fro OU related content.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here's an <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/full_screen/?channel_code=IDVR4004KO">OU Channel</a> via Splashcast.</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/p/SYBZ7327OU" wmode="transparent" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="300" width="400"><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="400"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=IDVR4004KO" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add OU Snippets to your page</font></a></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>It contains several shows - OpenLearn, OU, Open2.net, and some flotsam and jetsam from elsewhere on YouTube...<br />

<p>PS it's worth pointing out that the above channel only took a few moments to put together. Splashcast lets you cretae a show by subscribing to an RSS feed. The OU, Open2 and Openlearn shows were created in exactly that way- by entering the approriate YouTube username for each YouTube channel I wanted to subscribe to into the YouTube feed subscription slot on the definition page of each show...  <!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/splashcast" rel="tag">splashcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>The OU Library website has just been relaunched as <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk">Open Library 2.0</a>, so congrats to all concerned :-) </p>

<p><a title="Open Library 2.0 front page" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1471204269/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1404/1471204269_8d7347b0b8_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>You can tell it's 2.0 because of the fluid layout and the orange RSS button (err, wot no feed icon?!) in the news panel!</p>

<p>As ever, I assume it's all good and will only comment on the bits I don't like much ;-) For the lowdown on the new features, great new things to look for, check out the site's release notes... er.. hmmm... this is the closest I could find:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1382/1471262635_f68a14d50a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="354" width="500" /></p>

<p>(I don't really want to do a 101 here, but if you do have a feed from a page, <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/384.cfm">feed autodiscovery</a> and persistent URLs for each story item might be an idea on that page? And a proper <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">feed icon</a>? And if there aren't any related links, why bother with the header? The separate items could also be separated a little bit more clearly, maybe?)</p>

<p>I did notice a <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/lib20servs/index.cfm">Library 2.0 toolbox</a> in the services section too, so it'll be interesting to see how that develops. </p>

<p><a title="Open Library 2.0 Toolbox" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1472066558/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1404/1472066558_5c3ed1475d_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>(Maybe I need get things like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OU Library Traveller</a> up to production standard?  In fact, that post was part of that process... now I wonder, did it get finished? I remember tweaking the styling (which I guess would need to be orange, now?))</p>

<p>There are now quite a few Library feeds listed, some of them using Feedburner, which was interesting...</p>

<p>My immediate impression of the site was: "lots of words, lots of lists of links."</p>

<p>I'm also not too sure how the site is intended to be used? Is it supposed to be sticky? Or is it supposed to be a place I go to occasionally in order to find a particular link to somewhere else, which I can then bookmark?</p>

<p>At this point I probably should declare that I have no idea what I want from a library website or what I think other people might want from it (though analytics should help work that one out...). I look up books in the OU library "by proxy" on Amazon or Google Books using the Traveller script, or via my browser address line using a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html">smart keyword</a> or a  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html">custom keyword</a> to a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/redirects.php">OUseful redirect</a> (<em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/voyager/author/<strong>authorName</strong></em>, <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/voyager/isbn/<strong>ISBN</strong></em>, <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/voyager/keyword/<strong>keyword</strong></em>). I use a libezproxy bookmarklet to get me into commercial databases, I track library news and new books via my feedreader and so on. But then - I am hardly a typical user...</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the site...</p>

<p>Signs of personalisation and community are not too evident on the front page, although I did the site without any OU authentication (not that I could see anywhere to log in?). I wonder what sort of news is going to appear in the Library News box, too (and more importantly, who is that news targeted to?)</p>

<p>When I loaded the page, the featured links were "Libraries near you", "Your subject", "Services for you", which shows me the page is not mine. Maybe if I visited the site with an OU authentication cookie it would have links to "Libraries near me", "My subject(s)" and "My Services"?!</p>

<p>But that would be confusing navigationally... a bit like some of the current navigation. Clicking on the "Research" tab and the "Open Research Collections" graphic on the front page take me to two different pages. Which is fine... But how do I tell which page I'm on when I do go to one or the other of them? By using the coloured background cue in the sidebar navigation panel?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/1472096070_61ede9cdff.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="186" width="500" /></p>

<p><a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001443.html">Lorcan Dempsey</a> picked me up earlier in the week for posting "a little harsh[ly]" that librarians would rather record city of publication than an ISBN. I'm sure if I mentioned that I thought librarians should be kept well away from information architecture I'd get into even more trouble... so I won't... err... ;-)</p>

<p>PS I guess the new site launch means that all my previously posted links to library services are now well and truly broken! ;-) Good job Voyager is still in place though, and handy that it's searchable from the front page, even if it does violently hurl you into the stylistically very different Voyager site when you make a query...</p>

<p><a title="OU Voyager Catalogue" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1472057350/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1424/1472057350_b7ddc19d84_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>2.0&nbsp; has come to mean many things to many people,depending on when they first heard about it... style and presentation, underlying technology, personalisation, social networking features, leveraging "crowd intelligence", APIs, and so on. So how many 2.0 features - of whatever sort or legitimacy - are there on Open Library 2.0?</p>

<p>I'll spend the next week exploring and counting. If you'd like to play along, please send in your answers on a postcard/via a comment, etc etc. ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/library" rel="tag">library</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
