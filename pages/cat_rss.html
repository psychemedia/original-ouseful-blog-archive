<h3 class="title">"Feeding from Open Courseware" - OpenLearn Conference Abstract</h3>

<p>Earlier today, I had to combine a couple of abstracts I'd put in to the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007">OpenLearn Conference</a> for the single speaking slot I've been allocated. Although I normally keep everything, I couldn't track down either of the abstracts for quite some time, so I mailed the organisers to see if they could let me have copies back (unfortunately, the abstracts weren't on the conference website - I checked; and come to that, the same is true for the abstract of the presentation I'm giving at <a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/">Internet Librarian International 2007</a>, which I also appear to have, err, misplaced...!)</p>

<p>Anyway, assuming that I'm likely to have trouble tracking the new abstract down when I come to prepare my presentation in the <s>hours</s>, err, <em>days</em> (okay, Patrick? ;-) before the OpenLearn conference (30-31 October 2007), here it is... just in case...<br />

<strong>Feeding from Open Courseware - Exploring the Potential of Open Educational Content Delivery Using RSS Feeds.</strong><br />
Tony Hirst<br />
Faculty of Technology, The Open University</p>

<blockquote>Abstract
An implicit aim of many opencourseware projects, including OpenLearn, is to encourage the informal use of open educational resources, as well as its reuse. In this presentation, I shall describe several examples of how open courseware can be disaggregated into component parts that can be easily shared and republished using RSS and OPML web feeds.

<p>From 'daily learning chunks' delivered to candidate PLEs such as PageFlakes using a Web 2.0 mashup to mobile access, this approach can also be used to turn bibliographies into online bookstores and provide a way of displaying media assets in a rich media slideshow.</blockquote><br />
The original wave of opencourseware initiatives, such as MIT's OpenCourseware project, sought to make high quality educational resources available for reuse and repurposing by whosoever wanted to avail themselves of that content. More recent thinking implies that just providing the content is not enough. Approaches such as OpenLearn provide a learning environment around the content that can provide personal learning support tools and support the formation of learning communities and.</p>

<p>Although providing 'reuse and remix' opportunities forms part of the war cry for the OER community, few demonstrations of just how the content may be used in such a way are offered. In the same way that the learning object economy that was much heralded by educational technologists never seemed to be as successful as was originally hoped, is it possible that the hoped for reuse and remix of OERs will similarly fail to take off (Lamb, 2007)?<br />
 <br />
The granularity at which open courseware content is typically published - the course, or course unit - makes it difficult to consume bite size chunks of content easily, and arguably makes it difficult to discover reusable or remixable items of content.</p>

<p>As I have written elsewhere, '[t]he easiest remix is not really a remix at all, and barely counts as a reuse, though it is a republish or represent - just take a direct copy of someone else's content and make it your own property/publish it on your own site, in your own content area' (Hirst, 2007).</p>

<p>At the simplest level, exposing open educational content via an RSS feed immediately opens up this republishing opportunity.</p>

<p>Taking a lead from social websites such as youTube and flickr, where content can be shared at a fine level of granularity (the movie or picture level) as well as at an aggregated level (a playlist or photostream), I shall describe several implemented examples of how both MIT Open CourseWare courses, and Open University OpenLearn units, can be disaggregated into component parts and then republished in a syndicated way using OPML and RSS feeds, as well as through social networks.</p>

<p>One advantage of making content available via RSS is the wide variety of pre-existing tools that are capable of consuming RSS feeds. For example, it is possible to consume RSS feeds RSS readers (e.g. Bloglines or Google Reader) or webtops (e.g. Netvibes, iGoogle or PageFlakes), as well as republishing content in RSS format as PDF documents, or even audio files. Mobile support for RSS feeds is also widespread.</p>

<p>However, the use of RSS feeds as a significant route for publishing OER content does not seem to be widely recognised. For example, the Open Educational Practices and Resources. OLCOS Roadmap 2012 (Geser, 2007) uses its section entitled 'RSS feeds enrich educational portals and learners can subscribe directly to thematic content feeds' to refer more to the way learners can aggregate content around a particular topic from formal and informal publishers, such as news services and bloggers, without suggesting that OER providers themselves might publish educational content in this way. This in part reflects the mindset that RSS is used to publish changeable content or content that is regularly updated, as opposed to providing a way to syndicate fixed or static content, such as unchanging course material.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I will describe the process by which early demonstration RSS feeds for OpenLearn content were generated from the original OpenLearn XML content and MIT OCW web pages using various third party online tools. Essentially, this is just republishing the materials in the RSS medium, in addition to the HTML pages or printable PDF documents that are typically made available.</p>

<p>This "RSSified" content can be used as the basis for republishing and remixing the content by third party users, or consuming it in the location of their choice. For example, RSS versions of course units can be viewed using candidate personal learning environment "webtops" such as Netvibes and PageFlakes, or distributed as "daily learning chunks" using OpenLearn_daily, a Web 2.0 mashup involving OpenLearn and Yahoo Pipes; and simple content remixes can be derived using RSS feed filters and simple content analysis tools.</p>

<p>Reusing or repurposing material at the level of granularity with which it is published (that is, at the course or unit level) is problematic on several counts: the physical format of the materials may not be appropriate, the way multiple topics covered by the materials are bundled together may not deliver the correct storyline for the person wishing to reuse (elements of) the course, the materials may not have the correct blend of media assets for the intended reuse, and so on.</p>

<p>By disaggregating content and individual assets and republishing them as separate items in a single RSS feed, the component parts of a course can be made available as a cleanly packaged bundle of separate items without the need for heavyweight packaging formats.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, I will show how an MIT OCW course can be atomised in such a way that bibliographic information and media assets related to course examples can be republished via shareable, rich media feeds, and how the course as a whole can be disaggregated into component parts that can then be republished in aggregated form using an OPML feed.<br />
 <br />
I will also describe an automated process for treating an OpenLearn course unit in XML form as a database that can be "mined" - or "asset stripped" - in several different ways to expose particular components of the course, such as link collections or image collections. The link collections can then be used to seed custom search engines, and media assets can be passed into course related photostreams or online radio channels.</p>

PS Not having any 'proper' references to hand (as requested by several referees of the original abstracts who didn't hint at what those references might be, or even where they might come from), I put out a shout to a couple of people who work in the area to see if they had any good ones to hand. Apparently not... Now I used to be a real academic reference junky (honestly!) back in my PhD days, although even then I'd be as likely to cite a pre-print or technical report I'd found on an individual's web page as something from a heavyweight (= slow turnaround) journal. But now? I am soooooooooo out of the formal literature and don't even know what conferences or workshop series to follow, let alone what journals to read ... So if you do know offhand of any good references that might bolster the above, can you, err, please mail me link or DOI? Or share me the link via delicious? Ta muchly... (I'll give you an acknowledgment, of course :-)</p>

<p>PPS don't forget the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010364.html">OpenLern Remix competition</a>... there's still plenty of time to enter...</p>

<h3 class="title">Visualising OpenLearn Course Listings: Prequel</h3>

<p>Several weeks ago, I was chatting to Coral Stanion-Nazeri (who's running the <a href="http://ouclusters.ning.com/">OU Clusters</a> "social web tools for practice based learning" project for the Library) about visualising course data. I'd been thinking about visualising OU Courses and Qualifications data (for example, see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010472.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010499.html">here</a>) but Coral was thinking more in terms of improving the user experience on <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> - courses are listed by topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093270889175786498"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rq7u424pJAI/AAAAAAAAAOM/SNglGVKgAqM/s800/openlearnCourses1.png" /></a></p>

<p>and then by unit - often over several pages. The 'advanced' ordering options are useful, but it can still be a chore to discover a particular course:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093270906355655698"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rq7u524pJBI/AAAAAAAAAOU/pP8qyrgWnh8/s800/openlearnCourses2.png" /></a></p>

<p>Navigation within a course unit is also problematic (for example, see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009144.html">Navigating LabSpace</a>), but that's another story!</p>

<p>Anyway, Coral had been inspired by the treemap browser for a <a href="http://historywired.com/">collection of museum objects</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093273543465575458"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/Rq7xTW4pJCI/AAAAAAAAAOk/zHV6u9daLss/s800/historyWiredTreemap.png" /></a></p>

<p>and wondered whether a treemap browser for OpenLearn would aid navigation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app">Many Eyes</a> visualisation tool doesn't (yet?) support links from data to arbitrary URLs, so it can't be used for navigation, but it maybe can help with discovery, or at least demo the visual component for a possible navigation scheme.</p>

<p>So I thought I'd pop some OpenLearn course info into Many Eyes and see what it looked like.</p>

<p>The first issue was how to get the data in. It just so happens that there are some RSS feeds (due for release in mid-August, I think?) on the acceptance testing server that contain lists of courses by topic area, as well as a complete "all OpenLearn Units" feed. The feeds contain the course title, topic area, and course description for each course, as well as other metadata.</p>

<p>To generate a tabular listing of courses (i.e. to get the data into a format that I could copy and paste into Many Eyes) I ran the feed through a Yahoo pipe and took a JSON feed out, formatting the HTML display using a slightly modified version of the Yahoo pipes <a href="http://blog.pipes.yahoo.com/2007/06/12/working-with-pipes-on-your-web-site/">Working with Pipes on Your Website</a>.</p>

<p>I also used the pipe to add a couple of extra tags to the feed - the OpenLearn Unit code, and and the original course code, both extracted from the unit URL. I also used the Yahoo content analysis tool to generate a some "tags" for each unit, based on a content analysis of the unit description:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093279418980836418"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/Rq72pW4pJEI/AAAAAAAAAPE/NAaWJ6iqFmM/s800/openlearnFeedAugmented.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the processed result:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093280424003183698"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rq73j24pJFI/AAAAAAAAAPU/jvf0S2aAn3o/s800/openlearnFeedTabular%20view.png" /></a></p>

<p>The tabular layout means that when I select all this data and cut and paste it into Many Eyes, the columns are separated by tabs, just how Many Eyes likes it.</p>

<p>In the next post, I'll give a quick overview of how Many Eyes can be used to visualise the Openlearn course information...</p>

<h3 class="title">Static RSS Feed Content, Delivered Daily</h3>

<p>Something I realise I haven't posted about, but which has been sitting in my Yahoo Pipes area for some time, is a "daily feed item" pipe that will deliver items from a <em>static</em> RSS feed - like an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">OpenLearn Unit RSS feed</a> - according to a daily schedule, personalised according to the time you subscribe to the feed: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=_HA1AGDs2xG4VFhRCB2yXQ">Serialised Feed Pipe</a></p>

<p>That is, on subscribing to a feed with a particular "start time" and "duty cycle" (or "period"), you will receive items from the feed according to your own schedule: one feed item per day, for example, or one per week.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful for delivering <em>static</em> feed content, where the feed items do not change. In a "normal" RSS feed, such as a blog RSS feed, the feed contents reflect the most recent blog postings, and as such change whenever a new post is made. In a static feed, the content is fixed and "just" represented using an RSS format, so that subscription models and RSS rendering techniques can be used to syndicate and republish the content. One might imagine abridged versions of books being syndicated in the way, like the BBC Radio 4 "Book of the Week", only delivered as text, via an RSS feed, with one chapter delivered per day. (Of course, "static" podcast feeds can also be serialised and delivered in this way.)</p>

<p>The approach used in the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=_HA1AGDs2xG4VFhRCB2yXQ">serialised feed pipe</a> is essentially a generalisation of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a> approach, which allows you to sign up to OpenLearn course feeds and receive a new feed item from a particular unit according to your own schedule.</p>

<p>The pipe takes in a start time (in universal time), a delivery period (one additional feed item will be delivered for each period after the start time - one item a day, for example) and the URL of the feed to be serialised.</p>

<p><img alt="pipeFeedSerialiserInput.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeFeedSerialiserInput.png" width="379" height="292" border="0" /></p>

<p>Internally, the pipe passes this information - along with the <em>current</em> time - to another <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=hObiAyHs2xGeU6lEEpPZnA">pipe that calculates the number of items required in the feed</a>: </p>

<p><img alt="pipeSerialNumItemsCalc.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeSerialNumItemsCalc.png" width="929" height="492" border="0" /></p>

<p>The calculation simply subtracts the start  time from the current time, and divides it by the specified period.</p>

<p>This pipe then uses <em> yet another</em> internal pipe ("Feed Serialiser") to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=XPfTMuTP2xGUL12c3C7BQA">deliver the <em>specified number</em> of feed items</a> by simply truncating the feed after that number of items have been delivered.</p>

<p><img alt="pipeNumItems.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeNumItems.png" width="627" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's the actual "top level" pipe:</p>

<p><img alt="pipeFeedSerialiser.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeFeedSerialiser.png" width="911" height="565" border="0" /></p>

<p>I'll try and provide a web page interface to this over the next week or two, probably by tidying up this <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily/feedCycle.php">very basic "feed cycle" form</a>. I also need to add a couple more parameters in that let the user specify the number of feed items they want in the first delivery, as well as the additional number of feed items delivered in each feed cycle.</p>

<h3 class="title">Facebook Profiles and OpenLearn Annotation Streams</h3>

<p>I posted just now/the other day* about an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010482.html">OpenLearn Feed Annotation Stream</a>, that takes an RSS feed and annotates it with hopefully relevant links from OpenLearn. (You can try out the service with any RSS feed here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openlearnAnnotations.php">OpenLearn feed annotator</a>.) Re-reading a post from Martin (<a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/07/mo-facebook.html">Mo' Facebook</a>), I notice he picked up on a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010477.html">thought of mine</a> where I "suggest[ed] ways in which a status like function could be mined to aid learning and networking."</p>

<p>So here's a demo screenshot of how it might work, in part, using the feed from my Facebook Status as the basis for an OpenLearn Feed Annotation Stream.</p>

<p><img alt="facebookStatus.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/facebookStatus.png" width="699" height="527" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you have a Facebook account, you can find your status feed linked to from here: <em>http://www.facebook.com/minifeed.php?status&id=<strong>nnnnnn</strong></em>, where <em>nnnnnn</em> is your Facebook ID number, which you can find in the URL of your Facebook profile page (<em>http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=<strong>nnnnnn</strong></em>). So for example, here's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/minifeed.php?status&id=506612605">my Facebook status feed</a>.</p>

<p><small>*I'm at OU Residential a school in Bath for a week (ping me if you want to say hi and go for a pint!), so I'm queuing up a few posts so I can keep them dribbling out through the week. If someone beats me to this idea - well - this post was actually written about 10 mins after the previous post I made... ;-)</small></p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard: Filtered RSS Feed Display</h3>

<p>In response to a "user request" <a href="http://www.fredscapes.nl/2007/06/19.html#a1613">;-)</a> I added a couple of extra features to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard">OPML Dashboard</a>:<br />
<ul><li>(optional) limit on the number of items that are displayed in a the feed panels (the default is 4);</li><br />
<li>(optional) single word filter term applied to each feed. For example: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloglines.com%2Fexport%3Fid%3Dpsychemedia%26folder%3Dcorporate&filterterms=google&numFeedItems=&src=url&submit=Display+OPML">my "corporate" feedroll, filtered on "google"</a>.</li></ul></p>

<p>The filter was trivial to implement - if a search term is passed to the <em>opmlDisplaymanager</em> script, the feed that is loaded into each panel is actually a routed via a simple <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=8LTN1Jge3BGdW_SlJZhxuA">Yahoo filter pipe</a>. Only feed items that contain the filter term make it out of the pipe and as far as the feed display panel.</p>

<p>The pipe took all of five minutes to build an integrate and is good enough for proof of concept/rapid prototyping, methinks?</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard View: A Glanceable Display of Recent Social Bookmarks</h3>

<p>Having got the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010427.html">OPML Dashboard Display</a> prototype posted, I had a quick look around some of my previous OPML generating tools to see which ones would obviously benefit from a dashboard view. First up is the <em>Social Bookmarks Feed Roller</em>, which allows you to generate an OPML feed containing links to user-specified tagged feeds from some of the most  popular social bookmarking sites.</p>

<p>OUseful web page application: new, improved <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/sbfeedRoller.html">social bookmarks feed roller</a> ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5077924018241752050"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rnho_Ze5S_I/AAAAAAAAAGc/36dG-p2RPIs/s800/sbfeedroller.png" /></a></p>

<p>What this tool does is let you generate an online OPML file that points to a set of RSS feeds from one or more social bookmarking systems using one or more user names and tags.</p>

<p>For example, you can generate links to feeds from several different tags on you own social bookmarking account to provide you with a birds eye view of the latest links you have save to those particular tags (<em>use a single user name and several tags to generate the OPML</em>). Here's an example with half a dozen tags from my delicious account: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?src=url&id=http%3A%2F%2Fouseful.open.ac.uk%2FsbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%26tags%3Dopml%2Bmanager%2520web2.0%26services%3Ddelicioushttp%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%26tags%3Delearning%2520web2.0%2520design%2520video%2520audio%2520search%26services%3Ddelicious">single  user, multiple tags demo</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you a part of a group that is collecting resources using the same group tag on personal accounts across one or more social bookmarking sites, you can easily generate a feed that will provide you with an overview of the latest bookmarks from each individual (<em>use several user names and a single tag to generate the OPML</em>; note that at the current time, a link to the feed from <em>each</em> individual on <em>each</em> selected social bookmarking site will be generated).  Here's an example with the same tag from half a dozen delicious users (identified from my delicious network): <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?src=url&id=http%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%2520meisenstadt%2520nessman%2520jjn1%26tags%3Delearning%26services%3Ddelicious">multiple users, single tag demo (OPML Dashboard)</a>, <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&view=3p&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php?usrs=psychemedia%20jjn1%20meisenstadt%20nessman&tags=elearning&services=delicious">multiple users, single tag demo (Grazr)</a>. </p>

<p>To create the current version of the app I tweaked the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006101.html">original Social Bookmarking OPML Feed Roller</a> app by adding a couple links of OPML feed display tool links. In particular, it's now possible to open an automatically generated online OPML feed for a particular profile directly into an <em>OPML Dashboard</em> display, as well as a <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr widget</a> view.</p>

<p>Once you have opened the dashboard display, you can of course bookmark the page and revisit it for live bookmark updates whenever you choose.</p>

<p>More complex OPML files an be created <em>on-page</em> by generating an OPML Roll from a set of selected profiles. In order to view this compound OPML feed, you will have to select the OPML code, save it to a file, and upload it to an OPML hosting site such as <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr.com</a>.</p>

<p>Try it out here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/sbfeedRoller.html">Social Bookmarking Service OPML Feed Roller</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find a link to the service from the main <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard">OPML Dashboard</a> homepage.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard Display</h3>

<p>Generalising the approach for an dashboard (webtop) style OPML display protoyped in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010416.html">OPML Powered Dashboard Prototype - sort of...</a> , and originally idled about in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010415.html">OPML Powered Dashboards</a>, I've popped up an <em>OPML Dashboard Display Manager</em> at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/"http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/</a>.</p>

<p>The manager allows you to enter the URL of an OPML file (or public user details for popular OPML publishing/hosting sites)<br />
and the <em>OPML Dashboard</em> service will do the rest, displaying feeds that are pointed to from the OPML file in dashboard style:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5076009115662765026"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnGbZZe5S-I/AAAAAAAAAGM/NMivSRu6cHA/s800/opml2html.png" /></a></p>

<p>At the moment, folder structure in the OPML is completely ignored, so there's no way (at the current time) you can influence the grouping of the tabs, other than by changing the order of feeds in the OPML file: the OPML display manager scans left to right, adding panels in the order feeds are presented in the source OPML file.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Although the current OPML Dashboard Display Manager does not, as yet, really handle any OPML elements other than ones that point to RSS/Atom feeds, I have started experiment with various "intelligent" handlers for simple link items in the OPML file. First up is a handler for YouTube Playlists (using the tool developed in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010419.html">YouTube Playlist RSS Feeds With Video Enclosures (Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists Redux)</a>). If a link to a youTube playlist is present in an OPML file, this handler will display a Grazr widget that can play the movies contained in that playlist.</p>

<p>(A separate handler is also available to display a particular youTube movie, given the URL of its youTube page. At the moment, though, the styling used to display multiple playlists/movies is, err, completely missing...)</p>

<p>The styling of the panels is pretty much the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/documentation/reference.html">Google Feeds API default styling</a>. If anyone has suggestions for an improved style (or knows where to find a Google feeds API online style editor/scratchpad), please feel free to pass them along... :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">YouTube Playlist RSS Feeds With Video Enclosures  (Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists Redux)</h3>

<p>In what will (hopefully!) be the last post on this topic for a bit, here's a link to a Yahoo Pipe that will take in a YouTube Playlist URL, and produce an RSS feed of that playlist - with the appropriate movies attached as an enclosure to each item in the feed.</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg">YouTube Playlist Feed With Video Enclosures</a>.</p>

<p>What the attachment means is that you can <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9">view a YouTube playlist in a Grazr widget</a>, for example:</p>

<div style="height:400px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&amp;_render=rss&amp;_run=1&amp;youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9"></script></div>

<p>This pipe supercedes the approach described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</a>, which took a snapshot of a playlist and generated the feed from an enumerated list of movie IDs that were explicitly captured within a fixed URL; the new pipe scrapes a <em>live</em> feed from the playlist using a <a href="http://www.dapper.net/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=youtubePlaylistscraper">youTube Playlist scraper Dapp</a>.</p>

<p>If generating the feed URL from the Yahoo Pipes page is too much for you, this <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml">youTube Playlist viewing Grazr widget</a> (here's a youTube Playlist URL to try it with: <em>http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=398D1C0A2DC0ED05</em>):</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml"></script></div>

<p>Or if you'd rather watch a youTube movie playlist using a native Google gadget, check out this post:  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010394.html">Google Gadgets - RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, I now fully expect to see that youTube has opened up an API onto their playlists, making this stuff all redundant!</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Powered Dashboard Prototype - sort of...</h3>

<p>Picking up on the previous post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010415.html">OPML Powered Dashboards</a>, I couldn't resist seeing how easy it would be to build a demonstrator OPML powered dashboard using pre-existing components pulled off the web.</p>

<p>A quick search turned up an <a href="http://www.phpied.com/opml-to-html-via-javascript/">OPML2HTML Javascript routine</a>, which I complemented with this <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/importxml.html">XML import routine</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/">Google AJAX Feed API</a>. The feed API loads feeds into a page with a single line of code, via an RSS2JSON proxy (which gets around security issues), as well as offering display routines.</p>

<p>So here it is (only tested in Firefox...): <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/opmlDisplayTest2.html">minimal OPML powered dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5076009115662765026"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnGbZZe5S-I/AAAAAAAAAGM/NMivSRu6cHA/s800/opml2html.png" /></a></p>

<p>The feed displayed currently needs to reside on the local server in accordance with browser security policies. For the three column display to work properly, the OPML file must be of a particular form, in particular using the <em>column:left</em>, <em>column:middle</em>, <em>column:right</em> naming convention referred to in the previous post.</p>

<p>Other layout strategies are possible of course (e.g. just trundling through the OPML file and distributing the feed panels across each column).</p>

<p>At the moment, the only OPML elements that are recognised are the column outline elements and elements that point to RSS feeds. As mentioned in the previous post, it should also be easy enough to display straghtforward text/HTML in a simple text panel.</p>

<p>More of a challenge would be trying to handle GrazrScript... ;-)</p>

<p>All told, it took no longer than a couple of hours of tinkering to get the demo together, including finding the code resources and a basic 3 column CSS style. Sorting out the styling is the next challenge, and one I always have to battle with. Checking the code for cross-browser Javascript and CSS gripes is also required.</p>

<h3 class="title">GeoRSS from delicious Geo-tags via a Yahoo pipe</h3>

<p>Although there are now several ways to create geo-tagged feeds using map based interfaces - for example using <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/map-making-so-easy-caveman-could-do-it.html">Google Mymaps</a> - there may still be occasions when you want to get geo-tagged resources from social bookmarking systems such as delicious (err, maybe...?! ;-)</p>

<p>So here's a Yahoo Pipe that will do just that. It looks for tags of the form <em>geo:lat=</em> and <em>geo:long=</em> in a delicious feed and if it finds them it augments the feed item with corresponding <em>&lt;geo:lat&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;geo:long&gt;</em> tags:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075248365285493682"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm7nf5e5S7I/AAAAAAAAAFg/dT2EU8QoGDU/s800/deligeotag.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the pipe: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?urlinput1=del.icio.us%2Fpsychemedia%2Fou&_id=OujaT7cY3BG1RcJjyjUFzw">delicious geoRSS annotation pipe</a></p>

<p>And for example, here's a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Fpipes.yahoo.com%2Fpipes%2Fpipe.run%3F_id%3DOujaT7cY3BG1RcJjyjUFzw%26_render%3Drss%26_run%3D1%26urlinput1%3Ddel.icio.us%252Fpsychemedia%252Fou&ie=UTF8&z=9&om=1">demo feed plotted on a Google Map</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">delicious Feed Enhancer - Auto-Enclosures</h3>

<p>One of the nifty things about the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> feed processing widget is that it scans RSS feeds for media enclosures and embeds an appropriate player in the widget, wherever possible:</p>

<div style="height:400px;width:450px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&_render=rss" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&amp;_render=rss"></script></div>

<p>For example, if a Flash movie (<em>.swf</em> file) or audio file (<em>.mp3</em> or <em>.ram</em> (Real Audio)) are available as feed item enclosures, the Grazr widget will embed an appropriate video or audio flash player (see the above Grazr widget for a demo).</p>

<p>What this means is that <em>if</em> you can easily generate a feed with enclosures, you can easily create a multimedia channel.</p>

<p>This is exactly what <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> does: it provides an environment in which you can create multimedia playlists that feed a really nifty player widget (here's an example of a crude <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009963.html">Splashcast learning channel demo</a>). Splashcast can also scrape the content s of an RSS feed in search of media assets, and will provide a player for those, although I don't think it (yet) acts as a player for media enclosures (which I'd suggest is something of an oversight...)</p>

<p>However, the approach suggested here is to use a Yahoo pipe to <em>automatically</em> augment an RSS feed from the delicious social bookmarking tool with appropriate media file enclosures.</p>

<p>That is, users should be able to bookmark pages that may themselves contain embedded media resources, and then the pipe should be able to generate an enclosure link to the embedded resource from the bookmarked URL.</p>

<p>The reason why you'd want to bookmark the page containing the media resource rather than the resource itself is because the link to the resource is not necessarily very useful and is not the thing users are likely to naturally bookmark...</p>

<p>This allows you to create a social bookmarking RSS feed to act as the source of the media channel programme information, and then use Grazr to automatically embed an appropriate player for the media enclosures:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA">deliEnclosures</a> - augment an RSS feed from delicious with media enclosures.</blockquote>

<p>In particular, the pipe will augment bookmarked links from delicious with the following media enclosures:</p>

<p>- bookmarked mp3 files with an MP3 file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked ram (real audio) files with an ram file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked swf (Flash) files with a swf file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked youTube movie web pages with a swf video file enclosure.<br />
- bookmarked show pages from <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> with an MP3 audio file enclosure for that show.</p>

<p>The example Grazr player referred to above (available <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&_render=rss">here</a>) is "playing" a pipe augmented feed from <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl">del.icio.us/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl</a>. (The pipe also works if you link straight to the RSS feed: <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl">http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl</a>.)</p>

<p>At the moment, the pipe is set up to consume a list of links from delicious. With only a slight modification to the top of the pipe, it could be used to augment <em>any</em> feed when provided with its URL and so provide a general purpose feed augmentation pipe.</p>

<p>The pipe is also easily extensible in the sense that if media resource URLs can be easily derived from bookmarked page URLs (as in the case of youTube movies, for example), the pipe can be extended to process these URLs and add an appropriate media enclosure.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075080715532061586"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm5PBZe5S5I/AAAAAAAAAFA/Eo1mZ0ZhATg/s800/feedMediaEncl.png" /></a></p>

<p><s>(Not showing IT conversations augmentation...)</s></p>

<p>Here, the pipe filters the feed on items that can be augmented with media enclosures, and then processes items that can be directly augmented with an enclosure pointing straight to the bookmarked resource by simply copying the bookmarked URLs (like bookmarked links to MP3 files) straight to the enclosure. The next stage performs more complex mappings, in this case rewriting bookmarked youTube movie pages to the appropriate youTube movie file URL.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a> is not so well behaved in the way it formulates the URLs for the Flash movie associated with uploaded slideshows - an effectively arbitrary number is appended to file information contained within the URL of bookmarkable pages associated with each SlideShow. For example, the slideshow at <em>http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/social-bookmarking-sort-of/</em> is published via the Flash movie at <em>https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?doc=social-bookmarking-sort-of-12110</em>. The identifier <em>12110</em> is effectively unique, and can only be identified by scraping the resource web page.</p>

<p>If you know of other media sites - like youTube - that afford a mapping from a usefully bookmarkable(?) URL to a media resource URL. let me know and I'l add them to the pipe...</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Gadgets - RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player</h3>

<p>Some time ago, I posted a bookmarklet that created a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">YouTube Playlist RSS feed</a> by scraping a playlist page and calling a feed generating service with the IDs for the movies in that playlist.</p>

<p>Although YouTube provides RSS feeds for many services, playlists is not (currently) one of them. For example feeds by user, tag, most recently viewed, most favourited and so on (see the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/rssls">full list of YouTube RSS feeds/feed URL patterns</a>).</p>

<p>One problem with the bookmarklet approach was that a static feed was created for movies listed on the playlist at the time the feed was created. If the playlist changed, the changes would not be propagated to the feed.</p>

<p>So here's a temporary stopgap - a minimal, Dapper created <a href="http://www.dapper.net/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=youtubePlaylistscraper">YouTube Playlist RSS feed</a>. Given a YouTube playlist ID, the Dapp scrapes the actual YouTube playlist page and generates a feed. The link element in each feed item points to the YouTube page for each movie described in the playlist.</p>

<p>The Dapp actually creates a feed with an additional empty link on the end (bad scraping design on my part). Rather than tidy the feed in the Dapp, I thought I'd create a Yahoo! Pipe that would clean the Dapp feed and only pass on links that genuinely referred to a YouTube movie page: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg">clean YouTube playlist feed pipe</a>.</p>

<p>Having generated this feed, I thought I should provide a player for it. The feed items don't contain enough information to power a <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> channel - each feed item is limited to a title and a link at the current time - so I thought I'd try to find a way of wiring the feed into  another widget platform, in this case Google Gadgets.</p>

<p>For inspiration (i.e. code I could reuse ;-), I had a look at the Google create your own  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/gmcreator?moduleurl=gm_youtube.xml">YouTube Channel gadget</a> and a simple RSS viewing gadget (I've lost the reference for this at the mo :-(.</p>

<p>(To simplify the internals of the gadget, which actually feeds off the tidied Yahoo pipes filtered version of the scraped Youtube playlist feed, I use a good old fashioned URL rewrite, which takes URLs of the form <em>http://searchfeedr.com/youTubePlaylistFeed/FEEDURL</em> and rewrites them to the Yahoo pipe URL, which has the form <em>http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&textinput1=FEEDURL</em>.)</p>

<p>Here's the result: a <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?root=%2Fig&dpos=top&num=24&url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player gadget for iGoogle</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?synd=open&num=24&url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player gadget for your webpage</a> . (If you want the code, you can find it here: <a href="http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google Gadget - Youtube Playlist video player code</a>.)</p>

<p><script src="http://gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml&amp;up_mtitle=youTube%20Playlist%20Player&amp;up_mfeed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3D398D1C0A2DC0ED05&amp;synd=open&amp;w=320&amp;h=290&amp;title=YouTube+Playlist+Player&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;output=js"></script></p>

<p>This gadget can be added to your <a href="http://google.com/ig">Google iGoogle Personal page</a>, or embedded in your own blog or social network personal page, in the normal way. <a href="http://fusion.google.com/ig/add?synd=open&source=ggyp&moduleurl=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml" ><img src="http://gmodules.com/ig/images/plus_google.gif" style="border:0" alt="Add Google Youtube playlist player gadget" /></a></p>

<p>By default, the gadget is subscribed to a demo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=398D1C0A2DC0ED05">OUseful Media Futures YouTube Video Playlist</a>.</p>

<p>[UPDATE: if you don't want to use a Google Gadget, here's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010419.html">live youTube playlist feed video playing Grazr widget</a>]</p>

<p>To customise the gadget to use a YouTube playlist of your own (or your own choosing), simply go to the gadget customisation panel and paste in the URL of the YouTube playlist page you want to subscribe to:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073653261676399426"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rmk8wpe5S0I/AAAAAAAAAD4/cZ-PnjhtdVM/s800/youtubeGadgetConfig.png" style="border:0" /></a> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073654069130251090"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rmk9fpe5S1I/AAAAAAAAAEE/-eqBA-DfTFM/s800/youtubeGadgetHtmlConfig.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In retrospect, a far more efficient way of creating the gadget would be to simply use the gadget to scrape the YouTube playlist page directly rather than letting Dapp do this. I shouldn't really be using the extra URL rewrite step either, but it's a trick that can help speed up prototyping, so in that sense it's worth recording here. The gadget based scraper on my to do list, by the way, but way down there at the moment. (If you beat me to it, please post me a link. ;-)</p>

<p>Rather more pressing is the need to improve the gadget interface a little. What I have in mind is displaying a list of movie titles as the initial gadget view (simply reusing the simple feed gadget code). An additional <em>Menu</em> control item between the <em>Next</em> and <em>Previous</em> controls would link back to this list. Clicking on any menu item would play the corresponding movie in the gadget.</p>

<p>As to why would I want to access playlist feed? Partly because it provides an easy way of allowing users to programme an embedded YouTube player from a personally managed control panel, thus getting round the problem of subscribing a tag based feed that is open to spam attacks via the tags (that is, third parties injecting content into the tag feed by tagging movies in that way).</p>

<h3 class="title">Machine Tags and Automatic Feed Annotation</h3>

<p>Having had <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/07/rss-feed-annotation-streams.html">feed annotation streams</a> brought to mind recently, I was thinking today about a <a href="http://machinetags.org/">machine tag</a> processor that could be used to augment feeds from a service like delicious via some form of <em>tag based programming</em>.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>geo:lat=</em> machine tagging convention allows you to add geo-data to bookmarked items in services like delicious:</p>

<p><em>The Open University in the West Midlands : Home<br />
ou region ouregion region=04 geo:lat=52.4601 geo:long=-1.9449 geotagged</em></p>

<p>(In this example, I further use the "geotagged" tag to identify resources I have geotagged.)</p>

<p>A form of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006019.html">perfomative tagging</a> could then be used to invoke automatic feed annotation - in a sense, I guess the <em>geotagged</em> tag could be used to trigger a geo-annotation service that mines the informal tags of a bookmarked resource for <em>geo:</em> machine tags, and then augments the original feed with the correct geoRSS elements.</p>

<p>Alternatively, just passing the feed through a feed annotation service might cause it to be inspected for machine tags that can trigger feed annotations directly.</p>

<p>This augmented (annotated) feed could then be piped straight into a Google map, for example, to allow the feed items to be displayed directly on a map.</p>

<p>Another useful feed annotation service might be to identify a bookmarked resource as a multimedia file to trigger the annotation of the feed by adding an enclosure tag that could deliver the multimedia item as a payload. This could be done in a couple of ways, for example by virtue of an appropriate filetype suffix (e.g. <em>mpg</em>) or an automatically added <em>mime:type=audio/mpeg</em> machine tag. </p>

<p>(Do any social bookmarking services add mime-type machine tags to bookmarked resources? I wonder how useful it might be if they also did autodiscovery and popped and feeds or microformats that were duly discovered into a <em>feed:url=</em> machine tag...?)</p>

<p>Feed annotations could also be applied pre-emptively to feeds passed through the service: for example, given the bookmarked URL of a youTube movie page, it's easy enough to create the URL for a Flash movie enclosure for that resource.</p>

<p>So what would my <em>feed annotation processor</em> ("feed annotator") do? Well, for starters it would:</p>

<p>- accept an RSS feed, e.g. of resources on delicious;<br />
- inspect each item;<br />
- process machine tags appropriately (e.g. add appropriate geoRSS elements on finding <em>geo:</em> machine tags);<br />
- add enclosure tags based on heuristics (e.g. file suffix, URL (youTube page etc)).</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing I'd like to be trivially able to do in <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a>, but I can't think offhand how to do it?</p>

<p>Maybe <a href="http://popfly.ms">Popfly</a> or the new <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Mashup Editor</a> (any invites going for the latter??? ;-) could be used to implement this sort of functionality easily...?</p>

<h3 class="title">Disaggregating an MIT OpenCourseware Course into Separate RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>Picking up on a couple of points raised in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010211.html">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</a>, I've atomised the MIT OpenCourse Course <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a>  a little further and replaced some of the OPML items with RSS feeds.</p>

<p>In particular, I've replaced the list of video games with a feed containing those items pulled from an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/MITOCW-CMS610-Games/lm/R2356SXQHQ8XBJ/">Amazon Listmania list</a> via a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">third party Listmania2RSS service</a> (which I've used before in a similar context: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009154.html">OpenLearn/OCW Reading Lists</a>).</p>

<p>I've also created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1751CECCEFC5615C">youTube channel</a> with trailers/reviews of some of the example video games mentioned in the course. Applying the bookmarklet mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</a> to the youTube channel page creates a static snapshot (i.e. not live:-( RSS feed of the playlist, which can also be mixed into the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">course OPML</a> (or <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=on&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">view the course via grazr</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="mitocwdemo2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitocwdemo2.png" width="794" height="579" border="0" /></p>

<p>Finally, I added another Listmania list, this time for the books cited in the course.</p>

<p>..and as an afterthought, a link to a delicious feed pointing to a list of bookmarks of the books on the reading list that appear in Google Books. [Latency on replicating bookmarks across the delicious servers is really becoming an issue, methinks?]</p>

<p>Whilst I haven't done this (yet!), it's trivial to pipe the Listmania lists into an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">online shop</a>, courtesy of something like Amazon aStores.</p>

<p>This incremental disaggregation approach (?!) is a route I'm keen on exploring further as a way of identifying patterns that can be used <em>in reverse</em> as <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/just-try-it-mister/">exemplar mashup strategies</a>, by aggregating content from reusable raw components, rather than disaggregating it into reusable component parts.</p>

<p>The disaggregation step does, however, have the beneficial side effect  of producing reusable components from effectively closed (i.e. not trivially mashable or remixable) open content ;-)</p>

<p>PS for another take on educational mashup activity, check out the <a href="http://openconnectedsocial.learningparty.net/wiki/page/Mashups">Open, Connected, and Social: mashups</a> wiki page.</p>

<h3 class="title">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</h3>

<p>Over the weekend, I noticed that MIT OpenCourseWare courses were offering a "Download this Course" option. Intrigued, I immediately grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a> course and had a poke around inside it.</p>

<p>The download bundle is - I guess(?!) - a standard (?) IMS  - err - package? (can you tell I'm not up on educational material interoperability standards?!;-)</p>

<p>That is to say, the zip archive file opens into a set of nested directories with an <em>imsmanifest.xml</em> document.  The archive file also contained copies of the HTML pages used on the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">course website</a> as well as the PDF versions of the course lecture notes.</p>

<p>What I <em>had</em> been hoping for was a 'clean' XML version of the course webpages (i.e. a single source document from which they had been generated). Some hope!</p>

<p>Anyway, my initial enthusiasm curbed somewhat, I felt there was still some mileage to be made in RSSifiying the course, for three main reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly to see if what came out was "sensible" - i.e. whether a feed based version of the course could be sensibly viewed in a <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> or <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a> environment, for example.</p>

<p>Secondly, to get a feeling for how to decompose a feed-delivered version of the course into separate component feeds.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to see whether those component feeds could be automatically generated from the IMS manifest, or scraped from the MIT OpenCourseware web pages.</p>

<p>The course - as published on the MIT OpenCourseWare website - is structured according to the course syllabus, readings, lecture notes, projects (i.e. group and individual activities) and related resources.</p>

<p><img alt="mitHTML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitHTML.png" width="802" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>As a first pass, I have generated an OPML version of the course that follows a similar structure. At the moment, this OPML feed is - to all intents and purposes - a monolithic feed. Over the coming weeks I intend to disaggregate it into separate component feeds that can be reaggregated in an OPML feed that pulls in separate OPML and RSS component feeds.</p>

<p>You can view the OPML version of the course here: <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=off&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo.opml">MIT OCW CMS610 Spring, 2006, Comparative Media (via Grazr)</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="mitOPML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitOPML.png" width="911" height="317" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that at the current time, some of the links (to New York Times) resources require a NYT login. I will patch these as and when I can. In addition, the links to audio-visual resources should really be made available via an embedded player, as well as link to the original site.</p>

<p>A cursory scan of the OpenCourseWare site suggests that the way individual web pages are composed across different courses is rather arbitrary, which will make scraping the site to automate feed production somewhat tricky.</p>

<p>I should be thankful for small mercies in the way OpenLearn content is bundled as XML I suppose!</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/resistance-is-fertile/">this is spot on</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Unit Search Hub</h3>

<p>Picking up on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010189.html">previous post</a>, I knocked up a Yahoo Pipe that will use an OpenLearn course unit as an <em>outlinks <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005914.html">search hub</a></em>, demonstrating an automated way of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">extracting value from a course unit</a>: <em><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=CsnuX5Tu2xGWTorhJhOy0Q">OpenLearn Unit Outlinks Search Hub Pipe</a></em></p>

<p>The pipe uses this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkStripperRSS.xsl">OpenLearn link stripper XSLT</a> to extract all the outgoing links from a course unit, then feeds these into a Yahoo Search pipe, which uses the domains as search limits for the search (just as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009969.html">deliSearch</a> does with links pulled in from delicious and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010000.html">searchfeedr</a> does with links pulled in from an arbitrary feed:</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=CsnuX5Tu2xGWTorhJhOy0Q"><img stle="border:0" alt="outSearch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/outSearch.png" width="653" height="502" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>I'll add a link to a Grazrscript form for this search pipe to this post when I get a chance to cobble one together.</p>

<p>I'll also have to try and find 10 mins somewhere to add it to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn<em>_XMLProcessor</em></a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Yahoo Pipes Just Opened Up Arbitrary XML Input</h3>

<p>No time to play with this just at the mo, but worth reporting I think... A new block has appeared at <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Fetch Data</strong><br />
This module retrieves any XML or JSON file and tries to extract a list of elements using the provided path parameter.</blockquote></p>

<p><img alt="yahooDataFetch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/yahooDataFetch.png" width="504" height="378" border="0" /></p>

<p>The example pipe is empty at the moment: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/XsuoOujc2xG2GpwezKky6g/">http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/XsuoOujc2xG2GpwezKky6g/</a> (21:34, 29/3/07)</p>

<p>However, see a working example here: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=ypEo0_zd2xGgEDTaJhOy0Q">OPML RSS links 2 RSS</a>: "Aggregates all the RSS feeds listed in an online OPML file into a single feed. The title of every item in the aggregated feed is modified to include the title of its source feed. The newest items will appear first in the aggregated feed, and the maximum number of items may be specified (the default is 200). This Pipe! utilizes the new "Fetch Data" source."</p>

<p>There's also another <em>really</em> interesting block listed in the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=modules">Complete List of Pipes</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Web Service</strong><br />
This module posts XML or JSON to an outside REST web service and tries to parse the results.</blockquote><br />
The example link is to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/DEEMmujc2xGFlLFtlfXiAA/edit">http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/DEEMmujc2xGFlLFtlfXiAA/edit</a> but it currently points to non-existent pipe (21:34, 29/3/07)</p>

<p>So what? So - we can now get arbitrary XML into a pipe with the <em>Fetch Data</em> block, and soon will presumably be able to make complex XML calls to third party webservices.</p>

<p>For example, let's call an Amazon web service (creating the call URL using the <a href="http://www.awszone.com/scratchpads/aws/ecs.us/index.aws">AWS Scratchpad</a>, for example):</p>

<p><img alt="yahooAWS.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/yahooAWS.png" width="664" height="355" border="0" /></p>

<p>All we need now is the ability to output arbitrary XML... in the meantime, the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/VvHxcyG92xG60OkCEpPZnA/">Rename</a> module "lets you rename or copy item attributes." Which is a start...</p>

<h3 class="title">Pesky RSS Feeds, They Turn into All Sorts...</h3>

<p>A quick ack to <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/">Stuart Brown</a> who's picked up the 'so what can we do with these here OpenLearn content RSS feeds then?' baton and started running like crazy with it...</p>

<p>Today was a heads up to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/19955/Computers-bits-bytes">T171 on Scribd</a>. The route to this upload was an <a href-="http://xfruits.com/">xfruits RSS2PDF</a> conversion. Of course, now the content is in Scribd, it's available as a Word doc (just need the bookmarklet now to open this into Zoho ot Google docs...).</p>

<p><img alt="scribdT171.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/scribdT171.png" width="1043" height="479" border="0" /></p>

<p>Scribd also offers an audio version of the file, supposedly, but all I get is 'dash dash dash...'</p>

<p>Anyway, that's not really a problem because Stuart also tried the feed in <a href="http://en.blog.vocalfruits.com/">VocalFruits</a> and he mentioned it worked okay (public feeds aren't available yet).</p>

<p>Stuart's also been trying feeds out in various mobile browsers/feed readers, like the (secret) Grazr one and - err - a couple of others I cant find the links to, offhand... I'm not sure if he's tried it out inthe <a href="http://m.netvibes.com/">mobile Netvibes</a> feed reader though (how contrived was that link?!).</p>

<p>Just by the by, the OU has been looking at an XML to whatever production route fro several years now (and I believe have something available that's pretty reliable - at least, for documents written using the OU XML schema (which I guess is pretty close to the one used to release LabSpace XML).</p>

<p>The <em>ad hoc</em>, multi-format publication route described above is probably brittle as anything, but I reckon I could produce readable PDFs, Word docs, MP3s, RTFs, mobile browseable, widget readable versions of any text/image based OpenLearn content in at most an hour or two. Such is the good enough nature of - and widespread support for - RSS...</p>

<p>I'm sure LTS can also do the 'publish in any format' trick, far more reliably, and in a much shorter time than I can, too... (wanna race? ;-) But maybe the point is that it's not that clever in design terms (that is, almost anyone can use a variety of third party tools to achieve a similar effect), it's achieving the required reliability and scaleability that takes the effort.</p>

<p>Finally for today, another weak link: for readers who've been tinkering with OpenLearn materials, maybe even playing with some of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">OpenLearn course content feeds</a>, there's a call just gone out for the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php">openlearn 2007 conference</a>, taking place on 30-31 October 2007 in Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>The conference is free if you register in time and promise to talk, so I'm thinking maybe I should try and submit something...</p>

<h3 class="title">Grazr and the Question of State</h3>

<p>For a reason I can't quite work out, I woke up this morning wondering how to get state information into Grazr. What is state, you may ask? Think of it as the set of configuration data or information contained within a computer program, or web page. What is state good for? Configuring web forms, for one...</p>

<p>When you load a web page, the page itself is generally stateless. That is to say, the web page itself knows nothing about you. It is generic, although it may be customisable.</p>

<p>How then, do sites like Amazon always manage to know who you are, and serve you a customised page that identifies you explicitly?</p>

<p>One way is to use a <em>cookie</em> (<a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=84854">read about cookies on Openlearn</a>). Cookies are little data records that are stored on your computer by a website. When you first visit a website and enter your personal details, the website collects this information, creates a unique identifier for you and stores that identifier in a cookie on your computer. When you revisit the webpage, it looks for the cookie, sees who you are, and customises the page as a result. Cookies could store your personal details explicitly on your computer rather than a unique identifier, but this is usually a bad idea, for privacy reasons if nothing else.</p>

<p>To make things concrete in the Grazr world, consider the <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml">deliRolls</a> script that lets you view feeds corresponding to bookmarks tagged in a particular way by particular delicious users.</p>

<p>The form has two customisable inputs - one or more delicious usernames, and one or more tags. As it stands, there is no way I can preconfigure this particular widget (as it stands, and as far as I know...) so that it displays the feeds I was looking at previously each time I reload the page containing the widget.</p>

<p>A cookie would let me do this. A cookie could be used to save the delicious usernames and tags each time I change them, so that the next time I visit the page I see the widget configured as it was the last time I used it with the same browser.</p>

<p>Cookies are set in a browser using Javascript. However, whilst Grazr does support Javascript, the Javascript runs on the Grazr server to build the rendered OPML file, not in your browser. The Grazr widget itself is built using Javascript, but this is not accessible to the user.</p>

<p>So cookies can't be used at the moment to load state data into a Grazr widget (one for the wishlist, maybe? Some cookie handlers?).</p>

<p>Another way of getting state information - such as the delicious username(s) and tag(s) required by the deliRolls widget - is via the URI. This approach is taken by the Yahoo Pipes team: each interface/input element in a Yahoo pipe is exposed as an argument in the URI.</p>

<p>The same approach can easily be achieved in Grazr <em>if</em> it is possible to associate arguments with a GrazrScript URL.</p>

<p>For example, the deliRolls script lives at <em>http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml</em>; the script contains two arguments, corresponding to the input fields: <em>deliName</em> and <em>deliTag</em>. If these could be set via the OPML URL, it would be possible to load a preconfigured deliRolls widget.</p>

<p>For example, loading the Grazr widget with <em>http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml?deliName=psychemedia&deliTag=grazr%20opml</em> should load the form with two feeds from my delicious account: one with items that are tagged "grazr", the other with items that are tagged "opml".</p>

<p>By supporting the passing of arguments "into" GrazrScript OPML files in this way, it would also be possible to write Grazr wrappers that could set and read cookies, and then load in an appropriately configured GrazrScript file <em>without</em> the Grazr widget having to offer cookie support.</p>

<p>The stop gap is to write a GrazrScript generator that does accept URLs and that generates a customised OPML file that gets loaded into the Grazr widget (which is the approach taken for the generators listed in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009993.html">GrazrScript Generator Studio</a>) but it would be far more elegant if Grazr could handle this directly.</p>

<p>So here's my feature request:</p>

<p> - for every form variable in a GrazrScript file, expose it/handle it as a URL (HTTP GET) argument to the GrazrScript/OPML file.</p>

<p>I guess it would also be handy to be able to run an onload function, too, e.g. to simulate the form submit action so that the arguments passed into the form can be used automatically as a form submit action to preload the Grazr form result node.</p>

<p>PS here's another request too; it's possible to pass the name of a frame you want Grazr links to open in via the <em>linktarget=</em> argument. What would also be handy would be the ability to pass the URL you want to open into a callout function in the browser; for example, in the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a> environment, I'd like to be able to call a function that ensures the correct tab has the focus when a page is loaded from Grazr.<br />
Without thinking too deeply about it, what I'd like to be able to say is <em>callOut=foo</em> and then, whenever I click on a link in the Grazr widget, call <em>foo(url)</em> in the parent window, where <em>url</em> is the URL I clicked on in the Grazr widget.</p>

<p>PPS hmm, is it possible to run a GrazrScript serverside javascript function from a Grazr link, I wonder? That is, when a link is clicked, call a GSJS function?</p>

<p>PPS hmm, too - (after a msg from Mike) - I wonder if a GSJS <em>onload</em> callback/callout would be useful; that is, the ability to call a parent window Javascript function once the Grazr form has loaded.<br />
Mike also mentioned a hack that lets you display just the results of running a script in Grazr that I'll have a tinker with over the next few days...</p>

<h3 class="title">deliRoll - Scripting Grazr with Javascript</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the folks over at Grazr released serverside support for <a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2007/03/19/grazrscript-v12-beta/">Javascript contained within GrazrScript OPML files</a>.</p>

<p>What this means is that you can now script the OPML that a Grazr widget displays.</p>

<p>So what, you may say.... so Grazr widgets are now <em>programmable</em>; that is, Grazr can inspect what you have entered into a Grazr form then generate and render an appropriate set of feeds as a result.</p>

<p>I have <em>no time</em> for distractions at the moment but couldn't resist posting a demo, which is actually a minor reworking of some of the code in the rediscovered <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010032.html">social bookmarking feedroller</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="deliRoll.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliRoll.jpg" width="821" height="457" border="0" /></p>

<p>Enter one or more space separated delicious usernames and/or one or more space separated tag combinations, and a corresponding set of delicious feeds will be automatically generated.<br />
 <br />
You can <a href="http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml">view the OPML</a> directly, or view it on the <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml">deliRoll page</a>.</p>

<p>Or here:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/deliRolls.opml"></script></div>

<p>(You can find several other OPML and GrazrScript generators in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009993.html">GrazrScript Studio</a>.)</p>

<p>The Javascript support is still lacking one or two js features, but there's more than enough support already to start tinkering with.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like to see (and haven't tried yet - so it may already be supported) is a script include - that is, the ability to load in external Javascript files...</p>

<p>...and support for xmlhttprequest too, of course ;-)</p>

<p>But as I said - plenty to play with in there already... good stuff, chaps :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">More OPML Generators (old ones, restated...!)</h3>

<p>Regular readers probably know from all sorts of sources the Grazr folks are now hosting OPML files. So here's a couple of blasts from the past that may be of some use if you're new to OPML and want to try out some of your own feeds.</p>

<p>(You may also find them useful if you're a feed junky!)</p>

<p><em>Social bookmarking feed roller</em>: enter a list of usernames, a list of tags, select from a list of social bookmarking services and generate an online hosted OPML file that points to corresponding feeds from them all... (that is, for each service, feeds will be generated for each combination of the supplied usernames and tags): <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPMLFeedBlender.html">Social Bookmarking Feed Roller</a>.</p>

<p><em>News feed roller</em>: select one or more internet news providers (Yahoo, Google, MSN), enter a list of search terms and then generate an OPML feed that points to each news service with each search term: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsFeedsOPMLFeedBlenderC.html"> News Feed Roller</a></p>

<p>As well as generating links to online OPML feeds, you can use both services to construct more complex OPML files containing OPML folders that contain feeds generated for different combinations of social bookmarking system/user/tag or news service/search term combinations.</p>

<p>I've also got a set of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009993.html">GrazrScript generators</a> that will generate Grazr forms to search over various services (such as Amazon and OpenLearn) and that integrate with various Yahoo pipes.</p>

<h3 class="title">Auto-filtered deliSearch Pipe</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if this is working completely as I'd like it to  - I need to set up a clean delicious account to do some testing - but what it's <em>supposed</em> to do is take in a list of links from delicious, and then search each domain listed with the <em>tags</em> that the corresponding link was bookmarked with...</p>

<p>Try it: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=4jGS1M7T2xGdURL71fC6Jw">deliAutoFilter Pipe</a></p>

<p>That is - what I want to do is use the tags associated with each link as the search terms I search the corresponding domain with...</p>

<p><img alt="deliAutoFilter.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliAutoFilter.png" width="579" height="431" border="0" /></p>

<p>This makes use of the fact that delicious lists all the tags associated with a link in the <em>dc:subject</em> field associated with each feed item.</p>

<p>So what? So you can use delicious to define a custom filtering engine that limits on domains <em>and</em> search/filter terms applied to each domain.</p>

<p>PS this was my 400th <aem>OUseful.info</em> post, apparently... :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Serialised OPML</h3>

<p>Just a placeholder post this one, to a leave a 'note to self' to take the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009972.html">serialised feeds</a> idea a step further and look at producing a <em>serialised OPML</em> scheduler that will take an OPML file and release top level OPML nodes/directories according to a user specified schedule.</p>

<p>The generalised version should also be able to support:</p>

<p>- <em>nested scheduling</em> that will further schedule the release of the contents of subfolders (so for example I could define monthly scheduled folders containing weekly scheduled ones); and</p>

<p>- <em>sub-scheduling</em>, where feedcycled RSS feeds are automatically generated within an OPML folder (so for example when an OPML folder is published, it might contain feedcycles whose schedule/start time is dependent on the release date of the OPML folder that contains it).</p>

<p><a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/ ">Todd</a>, you interested in bouncing some ideas around relating to this?</p>

<h3 class="title">Serial Web Feeds via Yahoo Pipes</h3>

<p>Todd Slater over at <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/">Big IDEA</a> has just started developing a <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2007/03/serial-podcast-feed-generator/">podcast serialiser</a> (and <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2007/03/improved-serial-podcast-feed-generator/">here</a>):<br />
<blockquote>What if an instructor wants to podcast (subscription model) audio files? He has a few options. He can tell students to subscribe to his blog and then post audio files there on a weekly basis. This is a great option for the first quarter, but what does he do in subsequent quarters? All of the previous posts will be "old" and new students won't see them when they subscribe to the blog in a subsequent quarter. What he needs is something that will update the RSS feed based on the quarter's start date and a determined update interval.</blockquote></p>

<p>(Todd's app is developing apace, so it's worth checking hos blog for more recent posts, such as <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2007/03/podcast-feed-generator-getting-better/">this one</a>. I'm also with you on the abuse of the "podcast" term, Todd, and keep having to fight that battle here...).</p>

<p>This has a lot in common with the ideas I've been working up for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009213.html">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, and has prompted me into a bit of a tinker today.</p>

<p>The original plan was to subscribe to a feed with some user-specific info, like the time of subscription and the way in which they wanted the content delivered. From this info, and the current time stamp whenever the feed is polled, an appropriate number of feed items would be delivered to the user.</p>

<p>Stephen Downes commented in a personal email (I think) about the resource requirements/server load for popular feeds and I've been in several minds about the best way to count of items whenever a personalised feed is polled....</p>

<p>So, I've taken the easy way out, and rather than doing all the work myself (not much work in fact, but anyway....) I've handled the 'count the appropriate number of feed items' task over to <a href="http://pipes/yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=XPfTMuTP2xGUL12c3C7BQA">Feed Serialiser Pipe</a> takes in a couple of arguments - a feed URL and a digit - and simply counts out the corresponding number of feed items.</p>

<p>A form I've been doodling with over the last couple of weeks (and that <em>seriously</em> needs tidying!) provides the interface that allows the user to customise the delivery schedule and generates an appropriate, customised URL to subscribe to: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily/feedCycle.php">Serialised feed subscription form</a>.</p>

<p>The form lets you enter <em>any</em> feed URL (err, maybe....?;-) and a schedule according to which you'd like the feed items to be delivered. It then generates a URL for you to subscribe to which will deliver items as and when required. (At the moment, the items are delivered in narrative order, rather than reverse chronological order; when I get a chance, I'll add a switch that lets you select the ordering of your choice).</p>

<p>Some logic located at the customised feed URL then works out how many items are required in the feed whenever it's polled and calls the Yahoo Pipe with the appropriate arguments.</p>

<p>The server's still got work to do - quite a bit in fact, as it's acting as a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/howto-proxy.html#phpproxy">proxy</a> for the Yahoo Pipe feed and doesn't make use of cacheing (oops!) - but I'm hoping that as time goes by the Pipes folks offer more and more functionality and I can pass more and more of the logic over to them and hopefully end up with a purely Pipes based solution :-)</p>

<p>(One thing I'd like to see in the Pipes toolbox, which should be simple, is  a 'reverse the order of items in a feed' block for items that have no timestamp. This isn't anywhere near as complex as the current Sort block, so any chance of it guys? [SOLVED, I think... just using SORT to display descending order on <em>pubdate</em> works (I think), even though there is no pubdate...The question now is - how do I put logic into the Pipe, so I can supply a user argument and reverse sort if a 'reverseOrder' option is set by a user]:-)</p>

<p>Feel free to try the service out, and mail me - or comment - with any problems.</p>

<h3 class="title">Delicious2Opml Converter with optional deliSearch Tool</h3>

<p>Checking my weekly TechCrunch stats (a couple more people blogging with links into <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.Info</a> and I should break 400 subscribers on a 7-day average ;-) I came across a report of someone clicking through to a delicious2opml converter that I'd written some time ago, <em>and completely forgotten about</em>!</p>

<p>With <a href="http://grazr.com/files/psychemedia">Grazr now hosting OPML files</a> (that you have to upload as a file from your desktop) the cut, paste and save as OPML route followed by the delicious2OPML utility maybe useful at last :-)</p>

<p>At least - it may be useful now in revised form.</p>

<p>Firstly, I've added a couple of heuristics that will try to identify RSS and OPML feeds that have been bookmarked to delicious, and add them to the generated OPML file using an appropriate outline type.</p>

<p>Secondly, I've added the option to add a GrazrScript deliSearch form to the generated OPML. This form provides an interface to a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009301.html">deliSearch pipe on Yahoo</a> that will search over the domains listed in the feed generated from the supplied delicious username/tag combination.</p>

<p>Here's the new version:  <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog/deli2opml2.html">Revised delicious2OPML generator (with optional deliSearch)</a>.</p>

<p>You can see an example <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/grazrDeliLinkSearch.opml">here</a>:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?fview=o&ile=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/grazrDeliLinkSearch.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/grazrDeliLinkSearch.opml"></script></div>

<p>(To see how the generated OPML adds value over simply piping a delicious RSS feed into Grazr (aside from the deliSearch feature), compare the above with <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/opml+demo">this example</a>.)</p>

<h3 class="title">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</h3>

<p>I was just having a look at the RSS feeds that YouTube provides - and that Grazr can consume - and it seems that RSS feeds of individual playlists aren't provided.</p>

<p>[UPDATE - this post has largely been superseded by this one: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010394.html">Google Gadgets - RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player</a> which describes a live feed scraped from a YouTube playlist, and a way of publishing it via a Google Gadget.]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 2: here's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010419.html">live youTube playlist feed video playing Grazr widget</a>]</p>

<p>As a stopgap, here's a bookmarklet that will <a href="javascript:(function(){d=document;b=d.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];function ss(src){s=d.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src',src);b.appendChild(s);};ss('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/youTubeItems.js');})()">generate an RSS feed from a YouTube playlist page</a> (viewed either from one of your personal playlists or from a public playlist).</p>

<p>Pop the bookmarklet onto your browser bookmarks toolbar, visit a YouTube playlist page (like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=E341B7BCBE832CA0">this one</a> for example) and fire off the bookmarklet to go to a URL for an RSS feed based on that page.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/youTubeOPMLPlaylist.php?id2=Xabm8hRyXrk;Zoho%20Notebook%20Announcement,nsa5ZTRJQ5w;Web%202.0,6gmP4nk0EOE;Web%202.0%20...%20The%20Machine%20is%20Us/ing%20Us,">example feed</a> (generated from this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=CA23DDFA84A2ACC9">OUseful YouTube playlist</a>) and here's what happens when you view it in a Grazr widget:</p>

<div style="height:450px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=12pt&view=s&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/youTubeOPMLPlaylist.php?id2=Xabm8hRyXrk;Zoho%20Notebook%20Announcement,nsa5ZTRJQ5w;Web%202.0,6gmP4nk0EOE;Web%202.0%20...%20The%20Machine%20is%20Us/ing%20Us," target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?font=arial&amp;fontsize=12pt&amp;view=s&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/youTubeOPMLPlaylist.php?id2=Xabm8hRyXrk;Zoho%20Notebook%20Announcement,nsa5ZTRJQ5w;Web%202.0,6gmP4nk0EOE;Web%202.0%20...%20The%20Machine%20is%20Us/ing%20Us,"></script></div>

<p>You might also notice that Grazr is now CSS customisable and that a wide variety of different canned themes are available.</p>

<p>The"API" such as it is is as follows:</p>

<p> - ROOT URL: <em>http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/youTubeOPMLPlaylist.php</em> (the final resting place will be somewhere on the ouseful.open.ac.uk site, but I can't get in there via VPN to upload stuff at the mo :-(<br />
 - ARGUMENTS: *either* <em>id=</em> for a comma separated (no spaces) list of YouTube clip identifiers (e.g. <em>id=GQ3AcPEPbH0,D4upvi5ytFI,</em>, *or* <em>id2=</em> for a list of comma separated (no spaces) list of <em>semicolon delimited </em> YouTube clip identifiers and escaped clip descriptions (e.g. <em>d2=Xabm8hRyXrk;Zoho%20Notebook%20Announcement,nsa5ZTRJQ5w;Web%202.0,6gmP4nk0EOE;Web%202.0%20...%20The%20Machine%20is%20Us/ing%20Us,</em>).</p>

<p>This is ropey as anything of course (I expect it will break if a semicolon or comma appears in the title for example), but it's okay as proof of concept and for use in (constrained) rapid prototyping reuse of YouTube playlist feeds...</p>

[<s>For some reason, when you try to create the embed code from the actual widget, the <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html">Create a Grazr</a> page loses the escaping on the URL in the embedding code, which breaks the widget.</s> 21/2/07:FIXED (thanks, Mike)]</p>

<p>If I get a chance, I'll see if I can knock up a bookmarklet/GM script to automatically add a 'Grazr UI for this Pipe' link to appropriate Pipe run pages...</p>

<p>...or maybe the Pipes team will reveal their UI solution? (I wonder, are there any generic/easily customisable widgets out there that do this already?)<br />

<h3 class="title">Delivering Personally Scheduled Web Feeds</h3>

<p>Chatting to Nick Heap, Chair of the OU's <a href="http://telemat.open.ac.uk/webapps/">Web Applications Development Certificate courses</a>, about 'feedcycles' (like the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em></a> feeds) the other day, he pointed out yet another obvious and efficient way of doing part of it if we're to deliver content at scale using feedcycles ('static', pre-written, web feeds whose content is delivered according to a schedule determined by the user when they subscribe):</p>

<p>Simply run a job on each feed to create offline files/records that contain either a single item (one each for each delivery item - so e.g. delivery_item(n) would contain the <em>n</em>the item) or the list of items to date, plus the current one (so for example, the delivery_to_date(3) record would contain the first three delivery items, plus the current one (indexing from 0...)).</p>

<p>I've also started wondering what other options we might offer to allow users to schedule deliveries within their own feeds.</p>

<p>The options I've come up with include the <em>delivery time</em> (i.e. time of day each new item appears), the <em>delivery start date</em> (so for example I may want content to start next Tuesday; a 'header' item describing the feed would be made available immediately);  the <em>delivery period</em> (i.e. how frequently new items should appear); the <em>number of items in the first delivery</em> (a user may want to start with several items immediately - hmm, so I need an <em>Immediate start</em> button somewhere...); the <em>number of items per delivery</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a demo: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedCycle.php">schedule my feed</a> [URL subject to change]</p>

<p>I need to define some URL arguments to carry this information, which maybe something the folks at <a href="http://feedcycle.co.uk">FeedCycle</a> would be interested in chatting about/would have an opinion on?</p>

<p>I also need a way for subscribers to a feed to  - somehow - demand additional items? Hmm - maybe a <em>getahead</em> argument could do this? Users would add <em>?getahead=2</em> to the subscription URL to get the next 2 items over an above what they are already being fed? <em>getahead</em> would have to be relative - so to get the next two items over and above the additional two that have already been demanded would require the argument to change to  <em>?getahead=2</em>.</p>

<p>This suggests a model for updating feeds in a feedreader. A subscription option to 'get ahead in this feedcycle' would automatically take care of the <em>getahead</em> numbering.  The reader would also have to not think this were a completely new feed  - you would want to preserve the read/unread state of items that have already been delivered via the feedcycle.</p>

<p><em>getahead</em> could also be used to provide a negative offset, in effect a 'halt delivery' option, that would <em>delay</em> the delivery of new items by a particular number of delivery slots.</p>

<p>I suppose for completeness, you'd also need to support a 'pause' option, that would halt delivery of items until the user was ready to restart the cycle, at which point a relative negative <em>getahead</em> offset could be automatically generated. </p>

<p>And finaly, a 'fast forward to end' or 'all' option that would deliver the complete contents of the feedcycle.</p>

<p>Hmm - this is possibly richer than I thought - and achievable too?</p>

<p>PS in reply to <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38180">Stephen Downes</a> on this post, (whose commenting system doesn't work for me at the mo, which is why I'm posting here):<br />
<blockquote>I've learned from experience that you don't want to "run a job on each feed" - or, more accurately, that you want such a job to involve as few CPU cycles as possible. After all, if each feed represents several database lookups, some processing, and some file writing (and in my case, emailing) then customized feeds begin to generate some serious overhead</blockquote></p>

<p><em>I agree with what you're saying about server overhead for feed delivery, Stephen.</p>

<p>What I was thinking was that when you register a feed *as a publisher*, it's processed to produce N  (or 2N) flat files for an N item feed (newfeed_firstMitems.xml and newFeed_Mth_item.xml), each flat file file containing either the first M items or the M'th item.</p>

<p>When a feedreader polls the feedserver, the current timestamp is checked against the one in the feed URL, offset items (one ahead, etc) accounted for, and the corresponding number of items to be delivered calculated. The corresponding thisfeed_firstMitems.xml (or thisfeed_Mth_item.xml) is then returned. </p>

<p>I see the carving up of the submitted feed as an offline, run it once service executed to generate static files that can be returned as required. Judicious use of metadata to tell feedreaders when would be sensible to ping the feedserver should also be part of the mix. The path to a fully working, scaleable system is likely to be a twisty one, but the payoff in terms of utility to users is woth it, I think?</p>

<p>As to the comment - "I refused to call them 'serialized web feeds' because RSS is not a 'web' technology" - ok, slack use of language on my part, but I'm trying to get away from saying RSS feeds... ;-)</em></p>

<h3 class="title">Netvibes Search and the Pageflakes Browser</h3>

<p>Over the last few week, <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a> have both gone up a version and <a href="http://excite.co.uk">Excite.co.uk</a> has released its own <a href="http://mix.excite.co.uk/">Excite webtop/startpage</a> as a beta ("European grown all the way!!" apparently - which seems to be the way of a lot of this display surfaces?). Paying a visit today to Pageflakes and Nettvibes (seeing how they handle a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">course content feed</a> derived from an <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn LabSpace</a> course) a couple of new (to me at least) features caught my eye.</p>

<p>Firstly, Netvibes has a search filter that is applied over the feeds coming into a tab (the search is over link text and item description text, I think?):</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesFilter1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesFilter1.jpg" width="657" height="245" border="0" /></p>

<p>The filter also highlights the search/filter terms in the feed item description:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesFilter2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesFilter2.jpg" width="669" height="366" border="0" /></p>

<p>In Pageflakes, there is the option of opening links (fin the example I'm using, from a delicious RSS feed) in a floating, pop-up browser within the Pageflakes environment:</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOpenLinks1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOpenLinks1.jpg" width="292" height="233" border="0" /></p>

<p>I like the feel of this interaction - it's reminiscent of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">"Now follow this link" lightbox</a> pattern I doodled with a month or two ago.</p>

<p>Ideally, though, this pop-up embedded/floating browser requires a large screen resolution to allow the pop-up window to render the linked to page sensibly, yet still retain the Pageflakes context:</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOpenLinks2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOpenLinks2.jpg" width="720" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you don't use either of these applications regularly, or you use one and not the other, it's worth popping back every so often, I think, to see what new innovations they have come up.</p>

<p>And finally, just to recap on how these services display the OpenLearn course content feed, here are a couple of screenshots. </p>

<p>First, Pageflakes:</p>

<p><img alt="ccFeedPageflakes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ccFeedPageflakes.jpg" width="809" height="453" border="0" /></p>

<p>And here's the same feed in Netvibes:</p>

<p><img alt="ccFeedNetvibes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ccFeedNetvibes.jpg" width="617" height="451" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to try out the feed, here are a couple of links:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">Sample OpenLearn Course Content Feed</a> <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/subscribe.aspx?url=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml"><img alt="RSS Feed - Pageflakes" src="http://www.pageflakes.com/subscribe2.gif" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/subscribe.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fouseful.open.ac.uk%2Fopenlearnplayground%2FT180_8_rss.xml"><img src="http://www.netvibes.com/img/add2netvibes.gif" width="91" height="17" alt="Add to Netvibes" /></a> <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml"><img src="http://www.bloglines.com/images/sub_modern9.gif" alt="Subscribe with Bloglines" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p>It's also worth checking out the feed directly in Firefox and IE7...</p>

<h3 class="title">Online OPML Feed Management</h3>

<p>A couple of people have asked over the last week or two whether I knew of an online OPML manager that could be used to create and organise hosted OPML feeds that could then be wired directly into <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a>.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a play over the weekend, and again today over lunch, and from the <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/opml+manager">list of OPML managers</a> I've collected, <a href="http://opmlmanager.com">OPML Manager</a> seems to fit the bill nicely.</p>

<p>So nicely, in fact, I'm using it to feed the default Stringle environment:</p>

<p><img alt="stringleOPMLManager.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringleOPMLManager.jpg" width="672" height="494" border="0" /></p>

<p>What this means is I now have a completely online solution for handling what gets fed into the Stringle navigation panel (remember, you can enter your own URL for the OPML feed using the customisation panel or the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008357.html">StringLE URL API</a>).</p>

<p>I've added a link to OPML Manager from the top bar of StringLE. These tool links open in the Tools tab/panel (links from the Grazr navigation widget on the left hand side open in the Web panel).</p>

<p>You'll notice that the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> widget is now displaying a couple of OPML files (the blue feed icon). These are fed into Grazr as links - Grazr sniffs out the opml suffix and then handles them as you might expect it to...</p>

<p>I'm actually use these OPML files to pull in GrazrScripted search boxes - one for the OU Voyager library catalogue, one for Amazon (read more about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon in Grazr</a>).</p>

<p>The Learning Materials section pulls in <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn/Labspace</a> content that I <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008208.html">transformed to RSS</a>, both directly and in a crude 'remix'  - feeds generated from two Openlearn courses and piped through <a href="http://feeddigest.com/">FeedDigest</a>, along with a podcast feed, filtered using a couple of keywords, and then displayed in another Grazr widget (I'll pop a diagram up to show how it works in a couple of days...;-)</p>

<p>One thing I noticed doing this is that Grazr is capable of playing audio files embedded in a feed - there are some examples in the Learning materials section under 'Search Related IT Conversations' and here:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03"></script>
</div>

<p>Apparently, embedded movies are also on the way...</p>

<p>If you try out StringLE, why not pop in to the chat room to see if anyone else is there. There is also a wiki that I'm going to start adding content to, too, but feel free to chip in (anonymous access is allowed but you need the password: <em>StringLE</em>).</p>

<p>If anyone wants an invite to the demo whiteboard or Elgg space, mail me... or leave a note in the wiki (create an <em>Invites...</em> page if there isn't one there already...)</p>

<h3 class="title">The Three Faces of Grazr</h3>

<p>I've been playing with Grazr quite a bit lately (doodling with an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon Grazr search widget</a>, for example, as well as <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a>) and here are three distinct ways I've found of using it:<br />
<ol><li>for navigation - links can be fed into a Grazr sidebar widget configured to open clicked links in a named frame (typically a large central panel), using a <em>linktarget</em> argument in the Grazr URL; the script at <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php</em> takes two arguments - <em>s=</em> sets the URL for the 'splash' page that is displayed in the central panel when the page loads; the <em>u=</em> argument is the URL for the feed that is loaded into the Grazr widget; <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php?s=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr&u=http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/opml">Grazr <em>navigation</em> example</a>;</li><br />
<li>reading content - a Grazr widget can be used as a feed reader; just pass the Grazr widget the URL of the feed you want to read; <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=9pt&view=3p&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">Grazr <em>feedreading</em> exmple</a>;</li><br />
<li>as a (search) widget - the introduction of GrazrScript means that Grazr can make use of form elements to create customised, feed generating URLs; for search engines and catalogues that <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazon.opml">Grazr <em>form based (search) widget</em> example</a> (Amazon search); it is also possible to create a search engine widget if you can get search results into an RSS format, like this <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php?u=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrGoogleOPML.php">Google search Grazr widget</a>;</li></ol></p>

<p>Another three faces of Grazr are the three views it supports: slider view, outline view and three pane view. I also just noticed there's a built in audio player, so for podcast feeds that have an audio file attachment, you can listen to the podcast directly within Grazr... :-)</p>

<p>Try this, for example - I started pulling together a collection of audio files in the <a href="http://podchains.net/">Podchains</a> podcast playlist builder. Using Grazr, I now have a really handy way of playing the files contained in my <a href="http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03">podchains OUseful Audio feed</a> - try it out here: <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03">Grazr does audio...</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like StringLE will now be able to do audio ;-)</p>

<p>PS I just added this as a PS to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon Grazr widget post</a>, but I know how rarely I read reposts, so I'm going to post it here too:</p>

<p>Here's a quick way of customising a Grazr/Amazon search widget to let you 'hardwire' the locale and product type for the search. There are two buttons in the form  - one uses Javascript, the other doesn't:<br />
<script type="text/javascript">function createGrazr(){var countryNode=document.getElementById("country");var country=countryNode.options[countryNode.selectedIndex].value;var searchtypeNode=document.getElementById("searchtype");var searchtype=searchtypeNode.options[searchtypeNode.selectedIndex].value;window.location="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonOPML.php?country="+country+"&searchtype="+searchtype;}</script><form name="amznform" action="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonRedirect.php" method="GET">Amazon Search:<br />
Locale: <select name="country" id="country"><option value="uk">Amazon.co.uk</option><option value="ca">Amazon.ca</option><option value="us">Amazon.com</option><option value="de">Amazon.de</option><option value="jp">Amazon.jp</option><option value="fr">Amazon.fr</option></select><br />
Shop: <select name="searchtype" id="searchtype"><option value="Books">Books</option><option value="Classical">Classical Music</option><option value="DVD">DVD</option><option value="Electronics">Electronics</option><option value="Software">Software</option><option value="Music">Music</option><option value="SoftwareVideoGames">Software &amp; Games</option><option value="Toys">Toys &amp; Games</option></select><br />
Javascript: <input type="button" value="Grazr It!" onclick="createGrazr()" /><br />
Form Action: <input type="submit" value="Grazr It!" /></form></p>

<p>If the form doesn't appear in you feedreader, you can find one here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonConfig.html">Amazon/Grazr search widget customiser</a></p>

<h3 class="title">(Library Catalogue) Search Forms in Grazr</h3>

<p>One of the things I've been trying to figure out for Stringle is how to get search forms into the OPML fed navigation widget. RSS feeds can carry form elements, which was how I was going to try and address the problem.</p>

<p>But no need - because today <a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/03/grazrscript-beta/">Grazr announced GrazrScript</a>, "a programming language for feeds".<br />
<blockquote>At its core GrazrScript runs against a web service that parses the special GrazrScript directives embedded in the files to do interesting things and returns valid OPML or Feed files. GrazrScript 1.0 allows the embedding of XHTML forms, and a 'search and replace' template that, while relatively simple, enables all sorts of interesting applications.</blockquote></p>

<p>Here's a v quick demo, in StrinGLE, of using GrazrScript to provide a search in Grazr over the <a href="http://www.hclib.org/pub/">Hennepin County Library</a>, which has an OpenSearch/RSS interface to its Library Catalogue - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?s=http%3A//blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/03/grazrscript-beta/&o=http%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrScriptDemo1.opml">GrazrScript library catalogue search in StrinGLE</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the top level navigation - you can see the link to the library catalogue search area:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript1.jpg" width="706" height="262" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's the search box:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript2.jpg" width="247" height="171" border="0" /></p>

<p>Make a search - note you can also click through to get the result in the main web window:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript3.jpg" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you prefer, check out the search result in the Grazr widget:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript4.jpg" width="394" height="325" border="0" /></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how GrzrScript develops, but this is a really good start :-)</p>

<p>Now I wonder, is there a SPARQL results to RSS stylesheet out there anywhere?</p>

<p>PS I just pinched the code for a more complex (job search) form involving several form elements, including drop down lists, from the <a href="http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2006/11/feed_applicatio.html">Eirepreneur</a> blog,  and added it to the demo...</p>

<p>Job ads are potentially a good fit for open educational sites (targeted at adult learners) that need to pay their way with advertising, or affiliate/commission/referral fees, I think...? (Though note that that's not how they're being used here...)</p>

<h3 class="title">searchfeedr, pageSearch and deliSearch Combined Interface</h3>

<p>To try and simplify matters with my various feed limited searches, I've pulled together a combined interface that allows users to enter the limit source (a web feed URL, a page URL, or a delicious username/tag combination) into one text box, and the search terms into another:</p>

<p>I've also posted a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedrGenericPanelPlus.user.js">Greasemonkey script</a> and <a href="javascript:(function(){d=document;b=d.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];function ss(src){s=d.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src',src);b.appendChild(s);};ss('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedrGenericPanelPlus.js');})()">bookmarklet</a> that will add a searchfeedr box to delicious user tag pages, Wink user collections, Technorati tag pages and H20 playlist pages, with more to come, including a straightforward 'search the links on this page' tool.</p>

<p>In the meantine, here are three links demonstrating the URL API to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedrplus.php">searchfeedr+</a>:</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, the pieces come together...it's just a shame I have so many other side projects on the go...</p>

<p>Next stop is to integrate the <a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com">xoxotools</a> running on <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> into the searchfeedr app directly, along with the pagescraping tools. Then I'll be able to accept <em>whatever</em> in the search limit text box without the need for the feedSearch/pageSearch/deliSearch selction buttons - a quick parse of the limit string, and a test of the header of the page if the limit specifies a URL (to see if the page is (x)html - a web page -  or xml - a web feed) - should provide enough of a signal to invoke the appropriate tool automatically :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Learn About Feeds</h3>

<p>Through my affiliation with the Library, I was asked beore the summer break to write a couple of guides for a new crib sheet series - <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/workspace.cfm?wpid=5868">Learn About...</a> - being put together as a collaborative effort by the Library, IET and LTS. The new guides are an attempt to provide a standard, uniform set of quick guide briefings/mini-training guides that will replace the independent, and often duplicated (in terms of subject matter), offerings that have  been developed by separate units in recent years.</p>
<p>Many of the guides are still in draft form (though internal readers can see them on the IET Knowledge network) and cover a wide variety of new technologies, from blogs to wikis, web 2.0 to the semantic web, mobile learning to VLEs.</p>
<p>The guides I was asked to write cover social bookmarking and RSS/web feeds. Partly in response to a couple of other requests I've had recently for a briefing on web feeds, here's a draft  of that mini-guide. Comments, as ever, appreciated...</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Learn About: RSS and Web Feeds</h2>
<h2>What are they?</h2>
<p>RSS used to stand for something, but it doesn't really any more - a better term is <span style="font-style: italic;">web feed</span>. Web feeds are XML documents that can be used to transport links, HTML content and multimedia resources (audio and video attachments) around the web. Web feeds are machine readable and can be used to introduce content from one site into another.</p>

<p>The presence of a web feed is displayed on a page using this icon: <img src="http://www.feedicons.com/favicon.ico" alt="Feed icon" /></p>

<p>Web feeds were originally popularised as a way of syndicating blog news. Blogs typically publish one or more web feeds that users can subscribe to from either a web based or desktop client. The client regularly checks the feed to see if new content is available - if it is, it is pulled into the feedreader automatically, without the user having to check back with the publishing site themselves.</p>

<p>Podcasts and video feeds, as well as blog posts, are also syndicated using web feeds.</p>

<p>Web feeds are increasingly being used to syndicate lists of weblinks as link blogs - regularly (often daily) - posted annotated lists of new and interesting weblinks, that may be fed into (and merged with) a blog web feed from a social bookmarking service.</p>

<h2>Who's using them?</h2>

<p>Web feeds are produced published by bloggers to support user subscription to a blog. Web feeds are increasingly used to syndicate news and media feeds. The BBC, for example, publishes a wide selection of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm">news feeds</a>, as well as giving guidance on the selection of a feed reader.</p>

<p>Many academic publishers are also starting to use feeds to syndicate the contents listings of current journals. The British Library maintains a list of these at <a href="http://zetoc.mimas.ac.uk/rssjnllist.html">Zetoc</a>.</p>

<p>Podcast publishers make podcasts available using feeds that support media enclosures/attachments.</p>

<h2>Why are they significant? </h2>

<p>Web feeds can be used to transport content - HTML, weblinks, audio files, movies - around the web in an invisible, machine readable way. Web feeds are a 'push' technology in that users can <span style="font-style: italic;">subscribe </span>to web feeds, releasing them from the need to visit publisher's web sites to check for updates. Unlike incoming email, over which the user has little control, users <span style="font-style: italic;">choose </span>whether or not to subscribe to a web feed in their feedreader, and have personal control over whether or not to accept content from a particular publisher.</p>

<p>Web feeds can be easily subscribed to from bespoke feedreaders and online personal portals/webtops as well as many email clients. Web feeds are readily integrated into tradtional websites using widely availabe feed-to-html services.</p>

<p>Items can be published to web feeds in timecontrolled ways, thus allowing the time managed distribution of content.</p>

<h2>What are the downsides?</h2>

<p>Feed subscriptions add yet another channel of communication - and potentially yet another inbox - to the users online environment and thus place yet another demand on the user's attention.</p>

<h2>Where are they going?</h2>

<p>One good indicator of how feeds might be used to syndicate information is the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/Data">BBC Backstage project</a>, which lists experimental BBC web feeds.</p>

<p>Many browsers are now capable of detecting the presence of, and subscribing to, a web feed contained in a web page, alerting the user to the fact by displaying a feed logo on the browser address bar.</p>

<p>Feeds are increasingly being used as a transport medium for search queries and search results, using the <a href="http://www.opensearch.org">OpenSearch </a>protocol. Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox are both capable of adding OpenSearch compliant search engines to the browser search tool.</p>

<p>There is an increasing need to manage feeds and transport bundles of feeds. At the moment, the OPML feed protocol is the <em>de facto</em> standard for creating "feeds of feeds".</p>

<h2>What are the implications for teaching and learning?</h2>

<p>Web feeds allow users to opt-in to information provision and subscribe to information they are interested in and that is relevant to them. Examples include subscriptions to influential blogs, news providers, and contents listing of electronic journals.</p>

<p>Web feeds can be used to transport content into environments such as Moodle from other systems - social bookmarking services, library systems and saved (persistent) searches using OpenSearch. Students may also opt to use their own <a href="http://www.rev2.org/2006/09/09/web-based-desktop-pageflakes-revisited/">webtop</a> (web-desktop) to aggregate feeds and services, creating their own <span style="font-style: italic;">personal learning environment</span>.</p>

<p>Web feeds can be used to deliver current content into online course materials, for example feeding links to electronic resources in to a Further Reading or Current News section of online course materials.<br/></p>

<h2>Further reading and resources</h2>

<p>Examples of web feed integration into Moodle can be found on the <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">VLE Library Demo</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Bulk Upload Feed for Feeds Listed on a Webpage</h3>

<p>As I mentioned in a previous post about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007199.html">Managing OPML</a>, I've been struggling to find efficient ways of getting feed collections together, whether from individual links or link collections held on single page (and where the publishers haven't provided an OPML feed). Like <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/">Science Magazine</a>, for example:</p>

<p><img alt="scienceMagFeeds.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/scienceMagFeeds.jpg" width="562" height="345" border="0" /></p>

<p>So it was with interest that I picked up the following up from John Tropea at <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/07/07/feedshow-has-an-opml-builder/">LibraryClips</a>: an <a href="http://www.feedshow.com/goodies/opml/OPMLBuilder-create-opml-from-rss-list.php">OPML Builder</a> tool from <a href="http://www.feedshow.com/">feedshow</a> that will look for XML or RSS feeds within a web page, extract them and generate an OPML file of the results for something like <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/directory/">Blogbridge Library</a> feed off.</p>

<p>Here's the builder form:</p>

<p><img alt="opmlBuilder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/opmlBuilder.jpg" width="618" height="381" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are filters for different file types, as well as the ability to define custom filters.</p>

<p>It doesn't quite go far enough for me though;-) What I'd really like to do woul dbe able to define OPML folderes to bundle links from a page into subcollections. For example, at the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">OU Library new books</a> page, feeds are organised on the page by Faculty. It would be so handy to be able to use an enhanced OPMLBuilder tool to create an OPML file with the feeds organised in subset by Faculty...</p>

<p><img alt="OUlibraryNewBooksRSS.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUlibraryNewBooksRSS.jpg" width="624" height="665" border="0" /></p>

<p>Anyway, for what it's worth, here's a link to the feed generated by the Feedshow OPMLBuilder from the OU new books page: <a href="http://www.feedshow.com/goodies/opml/tmp/OPML_797bd8aeaeaabe9e1d4efd65a63474e1.xml">OU New Books (OPML)</a>.  (I wonder how persistent that link is, or would be if I have lots of filters applied? Ah - "Temporary OPML files are created (files are purged periodically, so don't link to these files)." - so the service is good for a bulk upload then, but not persistent reading lists...)</p>

<h3 class="title">Managing OPML</h3>

<p>For whatever reason, I didn't really get into <a href="http://share.opml.org/"Share Your OPML</a> when it launched and haven't yet played with <a href="http://www.opmlworkstation.com/">OPML Workstation</a>, though it's on my to do list, but I have been playing with <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/directory/">Blogbridge Library</a> (here's <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/trial1/">my trial account</a>) becuase I like the shelf metaphor, and I've also been playing with <a href="http://feedcollectors.com/">FeedCollectors</a>, mainly I think because I saw it announced someowhere on the day I was looking for a way of collecting feeds into OPML files (so I could upload them to my Blogbridge Library.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a brief review on how the playing has gone since I posted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007105.html">my review of Blogbridge Library</a>.</p>

<p>First off, I've been struggling with a way of uploading individual feeds to a Blogbridge Library shelf. Secondly, I'd like to be able to reorder the shelves, and perhaps drag items from one shelf and drop them on to another.</p>

<p>The second is self-explanatory (hopefully) but the first I can perhaps describe a little more clearly by comparison with <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a>, a 'lensing bookmarking service' that lets you collect bookmarks related to a particular topic  ina user managed 'lens' and organise links within the topic/lens in a set of user-defined subtopics (modules). (Stanford's <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H20 Playlists</a> are similar.)  For those of you who haven't visited Squidoo, here's a lens I set up to go with a talk about Firefox: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/ffSearch/">ffSearch on Squidoo</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="squidoo.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/squidoo.jpg" width="525" height="561" border="0" /></p>

<p>What I like about Squidoo, and what I'd like to see developed for the Blogbridge library, is the way you can bookmark pages (as in a social bookmarking system) from a bookmarklet, and associate them first with a lens:</p>

<p><img alt="squidooLens.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/squidooLens.jpg" width="283" height="515" border="0" /></p>

<p>and then a module/subtopic within a lens:</p>

<p><img alt="squidooModule.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/squidooModule.jpg" width="226" height="253" border="0" /></p>

<p>The mapping I'd like to see made form the Squidoo way of doing things, to a Blogbridge Library equivalent, is hopefully obvious: "lens to bookshelf" and "linklist module to item (i.e. feed collection) on bookshelf".</p>

<p>For bookmarking feeds that are hidden in a link tag (and so autodiscoverable), as for example in blog posts, it would be handy if the bookmarklet could avail itself of feed autodiscovery, as for example, demonstrated by this demo <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005818.html">+ feed 2 delicious</a> bookmarklet .</p>

<p>However, until that all becomes available (here's hoping) I've needed a way of bundling feeds into different OPML collections so I could upload to the Blogbrdige Library. For some things, I could perhaps have tweaked my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html">Pagelinks2OPMl</a> code, or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006527.html">OPML persistent feedroll generators</a> biut I figured there must be a 'delicious for OPML' service out there, and there is: <a href="http://feedcollectors.com/">Feedcollectors</a>.</p>

<p>The service is still a little ropey, but shows promise. You can order feeds by collection and get OPML feeds from the collection for example:</p>

<p><img alt="feedcollectorScience.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedcollectorScience.jpg" width="717" height="466" border="0" /></p>

<p>and upload feeds to a collection either individually or via an OPML feed itself.</p>

<p><img alt="feedcollectorScience2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedcollectorScience2.jpg" width="580" height="473" border="0" /></p>

<p>Several of my Blogbridge Library shelves are actually fed from OPML feeds from my FeedCollectors collections.</p>

<p>As with the Blogbridge Library, bookmarklet support for FeedCollectors is sadly lacking at the moment, something I may try to address if I ever find a spare half hour again...!</p>

<h3 class="title">O'Reilly Books Full Text from Amazon? Almost...</h3>

<p>This is just a placeholder post for a half hour (?) hack I don't have time to do just at the moment... <strong>Update:</strong>Safari/Amazon library lookup bookmarklets now added... </p>

<p>As O'Reilly are coming to the OU tomorrow (I think) [internal readers: email c.bailey for info] to talk about their <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a> electronic book service  - which even has its own <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?mode=file&file=html/SafariLabs1">labs</a>! - and their <a href="http://safariu.oreilly.com/">SafariU build-you-own-textbook service</a> I wondered about how they reference their ebooks in a URL, and whether it was URL based.</p>

<p>Well, it is... though to see the book text you need a subscription (which we have via the library of course...): for example, <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId=0596102356">this book</a> (the 'free' page is <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId=0596102356">here</a>).</p>

<p>Now, you can also get hold of book ISBNs in an <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">Amazon wishlist feed</a> (I have one of these feeds driving  a Firefox live bookmark) which has given me the idea of a <em>live booklist</em>... </p>

<p>Take one <strong>Amazon wishlist feed</strong>, to which I post O'Reilly books that interest me (perhaps I could scrape the publisher info from the ISBN and use a mixed publisher wishlist?), add a dash of <strong>libezproxy</strong> (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">here</a>) and republish as an feed. Consume as a <strong>live bookmark</strong>.</p>

<p>The user model is then this: I see a Safari book I like on Amazon, I add it to my Amazon O'Reilly wishlist, and then can pick up the full text of the book via a link fed to a live bookmark in my browser...</p>

<p>PS I hadn't noticed this at first:<br />
<blockquote>Safari  is an e-reference library where you can search across thousands of books from O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley, Cisco Press, Microsoft Press and more. Read books cover to cover or flip directly to the section you need in seconds.</blockquote></p>

<p>You can also search within books, and even with code fragments contained in the books:</p>

<p><img alt="oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" width="180" height="376" border="0" /></p>

<p>As it's lunchtime, here's a 5 minute hack/reversion of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Udell's library lookup bookmarklet scheme</a> - a 'public' <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari Library lookup</a> bookmarklet, and a libezproxified one: <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari (OU) Library lookup</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>I'll try and remember to add this to my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Feedrolled Persistent Federated Search</h3>

<p>On Friday, I had a quick tinker with the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006462.html">Persistent News Search OPML FeedRoller</a> and added a couple of links from it that already exist in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006101.html">Social Bookmarking Feedroller</a> - e.g. links to an OPML2PDF service, and an online OPML file for each profile. As a proof of concept, I also added an embedded OPML viewer (<a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/">Optimal</a> into the page  (please don't hammer this - I haven't had chance to install my own copy of the viewer onto a local server so it's being called from <a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/">http://optimalbrowser.com/</a> at the moment):</p>

<p><img alt="optimal.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimal.jpg" width="659" height="407" border="0" /></p>

<p>The results from each feed can also be viewed:</p>

<p><img alt="optimalView.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimalView.jpg" width="446" height="209" border="0" /></p>

<p>What the viewer does is allow you to inspect the feeds returned from each profile within the OPML feedroller page.</p>

<p>Now this was v easy to do, and it has got me thinking about how easy it is to cobble together federated search engines when easy to use interfaces exist. (I'm still waiting for a Z39.50 to RSS service to appear somewhere, but in the meantime I'll just have to keep trawling for OpenSearch interfaces.)</p>

<p>So - here are three things I'm going to be mulling over, over the next few days:</p>

<p>- OPML feedrolled persistent searches viewed in Optimal;<br />
- <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006428.html">history searching</a>; and<br />
- searches over socially bookmarked sites (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005877.html">deliSearch</a>).</p>

<p>All of these are potentially sensitive to the user - either helping you rediscover things you've seen, or thought memorable in the past - or allowing you to set up persistent searches in collections/over sources you trust.</p>

<p>And the idle question I'll have in mind to start things off will be whether these sorts of thing may be useful for students, and if so where, and  how we'd make the search box available, and perhaps more importantly, how we'd make the search <em>results</em> available.</p>

<p>PS if you want to try the persistent news search with embedded viewer, there's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsFeedsOPMLFeedBlenderC.html">demo here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">ROUTES AJAX Search</h3>

<p>Just going through the bombsite that is my mailbox, I came across a message I meant to blog but didn't: a demo AJAX based search for the OU <a href=h"ttp://routes.open.ac.uk">ROUTES</a> service:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/routes2.html">AJAXy ROUTES Search</a>.</p>

<p>A the moment, this searches over item descriptions (I think). I did wonder whether the following would be useful:</p>

<p>http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish&type=keyword<br />
http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish&type=description<br />
http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish&type=all</p>

<p>although it has the downside of being bespoke rather than compliant with some standard.</p>

<p>With IE7 consuming the opensearch (http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/) format, it would be good to see ROUTES search becoming OpenSearch compliant.</p>

<p>As a first (untested) guess, I imagine the OpenSearch definition might look something like this:</p>

<p>    &lt;?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?&gt;<br />
    &lt;OpenSearchDescription xmlns=http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchdescription/1.1/&gt;<br />
                &lt;ShortName&gt;OU-ROUTES&lt;/ShortName&gt;<br />
                &lt;Description&gt;Open University Example ROUTES Search&lt;/Description&gt;<br />
                &lt;Tags&gt;OU ROUTES&lt;/Tags&gt;<br />
                &lt;Contact&gt;J.C.Mcnulty@open.ac.uk&lt;/Contact&gt;</p>

<p>                &lt;Url type="application/rss+xml" template="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search={searchTerms}"/&gt;<br />
  &lt;/OpenSearchDescription&gt;</p>

<p>or perhaps even:</p>

<p>                &lt;Url type="application/rss+xml" template="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search={searchTerms}&amp;type={description}"/&gt;</p>

<p><br />
For OpenSearch compliance, I think there are a couple of tweaks required to the ROUTES RSS output:</p>

<p>RSS namespace:</p>

<p>&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:opensearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/"&gt;</p>

<p>In the &lt;channel&gt;, before the first item:</p>

<p>  &lt;opensearch:totalResults&gt; WHATEVER THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RESULTS IS&lt;/opensearch:totalResults&gt;<br />
    &lt;opensearch:startIndex&gt;THE NUMBER OF THE FIRST RESULT RETURNED&lt;/opensearch:startIndex&gt;<br />
    &lt;opensearch:itemsPerPage&gt;THE NUMBER OF ITEMS</opensearch:itemsPerPage&gt;<br />
    &lt;opensearch:link rel="search" href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/testOpensearchDescription.OR_WHATEVER.xml" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"/&gt;<br />
    &lt;opensearch:Query role="request" searchTerms="THE SEARCH TERMS" /&gt;</p>

<h3 class="title">A Bitty Browser and pagelinks2OPML URL Pipeline</h3>

<p>I've just been going through a holiday break's backlogged feeds and noticed that <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/">John Tropea</a> has been looking at finding ways of making <em>pagelinks</em> (i.e. the list of links referred to in a web page or blog post) useful and useable.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/04/14/web-browse-a-list-of-links-in-a-blog-post-via-opml/">recent post</a> he describes <a href="http://www.bitty.com/">Bitty Browser</a> - a <em>little browser that goes on any Web page, it's like Picture-in-Picture for the Web</em> - and asks how you could  get pagelinks browseable in this browser.</p>

<p>Err - how about using a pagelinks2opml web service <a href="http://www.bitty.com/manual/?contentvalue=http%3A%2F%2Fouseful.open.ac.uk%2Fpagelinks2opml.php%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59%2F006023.html&contenttype=opml">like this</a>, which uses an experimental pagelinks2opml web service (<em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php?url=</em>) to pull the links from an HTML page, shove them into an OPML feed, and pass this to <em>http://www.bitty.com/manual/?contentvalue=</em> for display in a Bitty Browser - a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006045.html">URL pipeline</a> in action you might say :-)</p>

<p>This service is a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html">web based version</a> of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005946.html">pagelinks2opml bookmarklet</a>. Unfortunatley, it's stability leaves something to be desired on some pages containing complex URLs (I need to tweak the settings I think) but it's okay with pages containing simple links.</p>

<p>Is this useful? Hopefully - at least as proof of concept.</p>

<p>The above example shows how it can be used to embed pagelinks in a Bitty Browser.</p>

<p>More generally, by using something like &lt;link rel='pagelinks' type='text/opml' href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php?url=THISPAGEURL' &gt; in the page header, then in principle anyone picking up the page can autodetect the OPML file containing the pagelinks. (Indeed, they could just feed the page URL into any pagleinks2opml service they have the URL <em>anyway</em> without needing to autodetect the pagelinks reference.)</p>

<p>However, using the &lt;link&gt; tag may be useful if it also signifies a small amount of additional markup in a page. Why? Well, the simple bookmarklet (and the above server script) potentially scrape ALL the links on the page, including links in the header, navigation links etc., although links with the suffix .js or .css can easily be ignored.</p>

<p>Perhaps what would be better would be to enforce the convention that the user adds a particular class attribute to any links they explicitly want to be included in a pagelinks2OPML listing (e.g. class='pagelink').</p>

<p>This could then be used to key the pagelinks2OPML bookmarklet/server script and ONLY the desired pagelinks would be included.</p>

<p>This approach does incur an overhead for the author - they have to additionally mark up those links they want included in the pagelinks2OPML OPML file - but if they are savvy enough to be able to add &lt;link&gt; tags to a page, this is probably acceptable.</p>

<h3 class="title">URL Pipelines</h3>

<p>A few more thoughts on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006038.html">URL pipes</a> and URL pipelines.</p>

<p>If you recall, the aim is to formalise in some way a scheme or pattern for feeding the output of one web service into an other via URLs. The intention? To provide a simple mechanism for wiring the web using URL pipelines...</p>

<p>(Just trawling some old bookmarks, I stumbled across a couple of related items which I may need to re-read: <a href="http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html">Udell on URL-line commands</a> and a piece on <a href="http://idealliance.org/proceedings/xtech05/papers/02-07-04/">APIs and social software</a>.)</p>

<p>For example, imagine something like the following, which would take an RSS feed from a social bookmarking system, generate an OPML version of it and pass this on to an OPML browser:</p>

<p>http://example.com/displayOPML?url=http://example.com/generateOPML?url=http://del.icio.us/tag/library</p>

<p>Loads of precedents exist already, of course, for example this XSLT knocked up by <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2006/02/07/delicious-reading-lists/">Danny Ayers</a>:<br />
<em>http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http%3A%2F%2Fpragmatron.org%2Fxslt%2Fdelicious-to-opml.xsl&xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%2Frss%2Fdanja%2Freadinglist%2Btech&transform=Submit</em></p>

<p>The form of this URL command is:<br />
<em>http://example.com/XSLT?xslfile=...&amp;xmlfile=</em><br />
and the output is an XML (OPML) file, which could in principle then be consumed by an OPML viewer, for example:<br />
<em>http://example.com/OPMLviewier?url=http://example.com/XSLT?xslfile=...&amp;xmlfile=</em><br />
 <br />
In order to set up URL command pipelines, you need to have services that can be:<br />
1) accessed via a URL, (http://example.com/service or http://example.com/service2 )<br />
2) take a URL as an argument (http://example.com/service?url=), and<br />
3) provide a page that can be fed into another service via its URL argument, (e.g. http://example.com/service2?url=http://example.com/service?url=)</p>

<p>You can then start to wire different services together in one long URL 'command line'<br />
(http://example.com/service2?url=http://example.com/service?url=http://example.com/data)</p>

<p>Managing long pipelines of URLs, and in particular which arguments belong to which URL in the chain is likely to be problematic (would just saying that the URL argument is always the last one for a given 'URL command' work, I wonder?), so one workaround would be to have a URL pipeline executive service which would manage the pipeline on the user's behalf.</p>

<p>How so? Well, this is how I see it possibly working (all just vaporware at the mo, the product of idling time whilst dog walking...):</p>

<p>First off, we need some <em>argument datatypes</em>, for example <em>feedURL</em> (perhaps broken down further into OPML, RSS, Atom etc.), <em>FOAF</em> or <em>calendar</em> record, or for additional return type arguments such as JSON feed or even Javascript include (i.e. things we can use either within a pipleline, or to terminate a pipeline, as with a Javascript include that embeds a reader or tagclound in a page, for example).</p>

<p>Second, we need a way to name and register RESTful services that take feedURL (FOAF, etc.) arguments, and perhaps return feedURL (FOAF, etc.) files. For example:</p>

<p>Name: <em>pagelinks2OPML</em><br />
Location: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php</em></p>

<p>Name: <em>OPMLbrowser</em><br />
Location: <em>http://www.optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php</em></p>

<p>We also need to record the input and output/return arguments for the service:</p>

<p>Input argument: <em>&amp;url= [HTML|feedURL|atom|rss2|OPML_dialect etc.], &amp;xsl=[XSLURL]</em> etc.<br />
Output: <em>[feedURL|atom|OPML_dialect|HTML|JSON|JS_include etc.]</em></p>

<p>So we might have:</p>

<p>Name: <em>pagelinks2OPML</em><br />
Location: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php?</em><br />
Input argument: <em>[HTML]</em><br />
Output: <em>[OPML]</em></p>

<p>Name: <em>OPMLbrowser</em><br />
Location: <em>http://www.optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php?</em><br />
Input argument: <em>&amp;url= [OPML]</em><br />
Output: <em>[HTML]</em></p>

<p>Name: <em>XSLTengine</em><br />
Location: <em>http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?</em><br />
Input argument: <em>&amp;xslfile= [XSL], &amp;xmlfile=[XML]</em><br />
Output: <em>[XML]</em></p>

<p>We might also define specific implementations of general services, such as:</p>

<p>Name: <em>delicious2OPML</em><br />
Location: <em>XSLTengine</em><br />
Input argument: &amp;url= [XML], &amp;xsl=http://pragmatron.org/xslt/delicious-to-opml.xsl</em><br />
Output: <em>[OPML]</em></p>

<p>The next step is to consider the URL pipeline executive, or processor, which might work as follows:</p>

<p>http://example.com/URLpipelineprocessor/<em>service2</em>/<em>service1</em></p>

<p>In particular, the processor replaces URL services with the name of the service (e.g. <em>service2</em> replaces <em>http://example.com/service2</em>) and the trailing <em>&amp;url</em> with a '/'.</p>

<p>So for example, we would write something like:</p>

<p>http://example.com/URLpipelineprocessor/OPMLbrowser/pagelinks2OPML/blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html</p>

<p>rather than:</p>

<p>http://www.optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php?url=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php?url=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html</p>

<p>The pipeline processor could work in two ways - firstly it might just (using redirects?) a long URL pipeline, writing itself out of the final URL. I'm not sure whether this would work correctly at all...Secondly, it could act as intermediary, generating different intermediate URLs that can be passed to each service in the pipeline in turn, so that each service is only presented with a single URL.</p>

<p>That is, in this second approach, the role of the URLpipelineprocessor is to:</p>

<p>1) identify the intial input URL (e.g. blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html)<br />
2) feed it in to the first service (http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php), and<br />
3) relay the output via an intermediate URL to the second service (e.g.  http://www.optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php?url=http://example.com/d2a36e2); the intermediate URL (http://example.com/d2a36e2) is actually a page that republishes the output of the previous step (http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/pagelinks2opml.php?url=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006027.html) <em>or</em> translates it from the filetype output from the first service to the filetype required as input to the second service (this might be appropriate for example where one service produces an Atom feed output and the other will only accept RSS).</p>

<p>In other words, the processor would have to execute something like the following process:</p>

<p>- URL = get input URL<br />
- currentService = get first service<br />
- while there are further services in the pipleine<br />
-- outputPage = capture currentService?url=URL<br />
-- URL = republish outputPage at a local url<br />
-- currentService = get next service in pipeline</p>

<p>It us then up to the user as to how to display/consume final output (e.g. by embedding a Javascript include produced by the final serivce in a page, or letting the final serivce in the chain return an output HTML page).</p>

<p>Instead of building the pipleine processor as a webservice, another approach would be to embed it in a browser so that it could support keyword pipelining, for example.</p>

<p>By setting up a patchboard/matrix listing URL fed services, and identifying which can be fed into which by virtue of their input/output types, it would be possible to wire up and generate URL pipelines relatively easily.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> the <a href="http://xmlarmyknife.org/">XMLArmyKnife</a> uses <a href="http://xmlarmyknife.org/blog/archives/000253.html">URL Pipelining</a> to great effect...</p>

<h3 class="title">deliShow: A del.icio.us RSS Slide Show</h3>

<p>A year ago now I wrote a script  to run a slide show form a delicious RSS feed. For some reason,  I never posted it anywhere, possibly because it needed tidying up/styling.</p>

<p>Anyway - time has moved on, I still haven't styled the control panel, and I want to get this posted so I can refer to it... So: </p>

<p>If you want to run a slideshow or presentation of web pages, fed from a delicous RSS feed, here's a way to do it:</p>

<p>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/deliShow/<em>deliciousUsername/deliciousTag</em></p>

<p>A control panel will appear:</p>

<p><img alt="deliShow.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliShow.JPG" width="648" height="181" border="0" /></p>

<p>and a slide show of the pages listed in the corresponding delicious RSS feed (http://del.icio.us/rss/<em>deliciousUsername/deliciousTag</em>) will start after a short delay.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other arguments that can be added to the show:</p>

<p><em>&amp;num= </em> sets the number of 'slides' in the show before repeating;</p>

<p><em>&amp;td=</em> sets the delay (in seconds; default =10) between each 'slide' in the show.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p>OUseful Blog <em>feedthru</em> links: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/deliShow/psychemedia/feedthru">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/deliShow/psychemedia/feedthru</a></p>

<p>UPDATE 30/7/07: <a href="http://www.fichey.com/">fichey.com</a> (<a href="http://anerroroccurredwhileprocessingthisdirective.com/2007/07/26/fichey-is-out/">fichey blog</a>) has all but the personalisation bit up and running in a slick interface... at the moment, it uses feeds from delicious, digg, reddit etc. If personalised feed sources are enabled, I'll be using this tool for OUseful workshops...</p>

<h3 class="title">FeedFlaring OUseful Info</h3>

<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: are <em>you</em> subscribed to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful"><em>richest</em> OUseful Blog feed</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful" title="Subscribe to my feed, OUseful Info" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon16x16.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a>?</p>

<p>A little while ago, I started using <a href="http://feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a> to syndicate my <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Info feed</a>.</p>

<p>If you're still subscribed to the feed via <em>blogs.open.ac.uk</em> etc. here's a couple more reasons why you should move over to <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">the OUseful feed at Feedburner</a>:</p>

<p>1) The feed address is guaranteed not to change, even if I move the OUseful blog, which is quite likely to happen.</p>

<p><img alt="feedBurnedInBloglines.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedBurnedInBloglines.JPG" width="420" height="593" border="0" /></p>

<p>2) The new feed has a couple of additions at the bottom of each post - an <em>Email this</em> link, so you can email the post on, and an <em>Add to del.icio.us</em> for easier bookmarking. These additions come via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedflare">Feedflare</a>; with the introduction of the <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/api/feedflare">Feedflare API</a> a couple of weeks ago, I'm hoping for some interesting additional inserts being made available over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>3) I bookmark reasonably heavily on delicious, and while a lot of the bookmarks posted there are not really relevant to the themes of this blog, some are. So if you're reading this via Feedburner, you'll now get a daily insert of that subset of my delicious bookmarks tagged as <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">feedthru</a>. I'll also strat making an effort to annotate/comment the links, which I haven;t tended to do in the past.</p>

<p>So  - if you're a subscriber - check to see your subscribed via <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful</a></p>

<h3 class="title">OUseful Feed Now Available from Feedburner</h3>

<p>As this blog is hosted on an old, generic OU blogserver (one set up, in fact, some time ago for students on particular courses), and may be replaced as we move to our new, Moodled VLE, I'd like to encourage any readers to move their subscription to this blog over to my new Feedburner feed: <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner</a></p>

<p>Feedburner offers a few added value services too (like its <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedflare">Feedflare</a> extensions, which add <em>Email this</em> and <em>Add to del.icio.us</em> links, for example).</p>

<p>There's also the option to mix in a daily summary of <a href="http://del.icio.uc/psychemedia">my del.icio.us posts</a>, which I'll look at...</p>

<p>However, as my posts there can be v eclectic at times, I'll perhaps see if I can just mix in summaries of posts tagged in a particular way (<em>ouseful</em> perhaps...)</p>

<p>So - if you do subscribe to this blog via the unwieldy <em>blogs.open.ac.uk etc</em> feed, please consider moving the subscription to <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful" title="Subscribe to my feed, OUseful Info" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon16x16.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<h3 class="title">Feed Reading in Connotea?</h3>

<p>In a couple of recent posts (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005227.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005088.html">here</a>)  I've posted how the OU Library has started getting into the habit of producing RSS feeds (yippee!:-)</p>

<p>These can readily be integrated into an <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">official</a> or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html"><em>ad hoc</em></a> MyOpenLibrary page.</p>

<p>One question that just came to mind is this: how about being able to consume Library feeds from <em>within</em> <a title="Connotea - a free online reference management service for scientists" href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably know, Connotea is promoting itself as "a free online reference management service for scientists", but it is also admirably suited to providing an educational social bookmarking service, for HE (undergraduate, as well as postgraduate, Higher Education) at least.</p>

<p>One thing that prompted the integration thought is that Connotea <em>already</em> allows users to enter their academic library's <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=news_openurl">OpenURL resolver</a> information to allow for easy access to online academic content that the user's host library subscribes to.</p>

<p>By integrating a user's home library's alerts services (such as new books, and current loans information*) into Connotea, it will be one more stop towards a unified academic reference management tool.</p>

<p>*perhaps seemlessly bookmarking the latter as new books are borrowed, and highlighting the former as possibly worth a browse?</p>

<p>Hmm - I wonder whether Conntoea should be offering a MyOpenLibrary like interface too..?</p>

<p>PS I believe that the OU has just moved away from Athens authentication to letting users who have been authenticated by the OU's single authentication system gain access to Library mediated third party services. This should make accessing electronic resources via bookmarks easier (if the OU authentication cookie is set, of course!), and means there is no need for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003152.html">Athens toolbar</a> like services in any future <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library toolbar</a> (official one coming soon???).</p>

<p>PPS More and more eJournals offefr an RSS feed of contents for latest journal issues - for example, I subscribe to <a href="http://dlib.org/rss/dlib.rss">this one from Dlib</a>. It might be quite useful if I could subscribe to such feeds in Connotea, and copy references to my connotea library from the RSS feed, in much the same way that I can copy other uses' references.</p>

<h3 class="title">Playing With the ROUTES-XML Feed - Getting There</h3>

<p>I mentioned in <a title="OUseful Info: Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost..." href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004853.html">OUseful Info: Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost...</a> a quick demo looking at how to consume a ROUTES-XML feed, but all it used was a static, test page to deliver results.</p>

<p>However, I couldn't resist having another quick play and making use of the service for real, so here's <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/OUsefulROUTES.html">a more complete demo</a>.</p>

<p>It's very ropey of course, and the form doesn't work properly, but it's not supposed to be much more than a minimal proof-of-concept prototype for my own education.</p>

<p>I haven't tested the script properly of course, so it may get taken down at any point... <br />

<h3 class="title">TSCP Course News on Google Homepage</h3>

<p>I've commented in several previous posts about a few of the ways that course news feeds can be viewed in an everday and pain-free way (e.g. <a title="OUseful Info: Easy-to-use Course RSS Feeds?" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004111.html">here</a>  and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004181.html">here</a>),  and here's another - via a <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">personalised Google homepage</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="googleIgTSCPNews.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleIgTSCPNews.JPG" width="493" height="442" border="0" /></p>

<p>There's a limited amount of customisation of the feed allowed, specifically - you can change how many headlines are displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="googleIgPrefs.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleIgPrefs.JPG" width="441" height="227" border="0" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>If you want to see how easy it is to set this up, check out this (silent) <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googlePersonalRSS.wmv">screencast</a> (Windows only? or at least, you'll need a wmv viewer (sorry - experimenting with what produces the smallest files...)).</p>

<p>One of the downsides is that you'll need to register with Google, and use the personalised homepage http://www.google.com/ig (which I think is the default on the Google toolbar? It seems to work that way in my setup, but perhaps that's just because a Google cookie shows I'm usually logged in to <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> (or should that be <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/googlemail.html">Googlemail</a> here in the UK?;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Playing with the ROUTES XML feed - almost...</h3>

<p>Although an <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml.php?course=Technology">XML feed from ROUTES</a> has been available for some time (and as Ive mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=xml+routes">various posts</a> before), I'm not sure how widely it's being used to actually feed ROUTES information into other pages. Some course eDesktop pages do republish ROUTES information, and it's quite possible that this is captured from the ROUTES feed in some way (e.g. when publishing a site from its XML template), but a quick inspection of the ROUTES site itself suggests that the ROUTES search pages do not use the XML feed to display the results?</p>

<p>Why should they, though? Well, as ever, when I get a glimpse of how a Javascript trick works, I think it should be applied everywhere!;-) And the latest thing I've been tinkering with is xmlhttprequest... Now I know this has been around for a long time, but I've only recently just started to play with it, spurred on in part by it's 'rebranding' earlier this year as <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a> (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).</p>

<p>One of the main attractions of xmlhttprequest is that it can be used to modify content within a page with new content obtained from a server, without having to refresh the page. This generally makes for a far smoother user interaction, and also means that you cut down on exposing the user to messy URLs in the browser address line.</p>

<p>To give a quick example, here's a link to a ROUTES-XML search on the keyword <em>Technology</em>. The file I'm calling is actually a capture of a ROUTES-XML response - the xmlhttprequest security policy has been defined to prevent requests being made from one domain to another, so I can't actually make a request to the ROUTES-XML service itself.</p>

<p>Once you click on the link in the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/ajaxROUTESxmlDemo1.html" target="_blank">test page</a>, an xmlhttprequest is made to a test page, which returns the search response as an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/routes_xml.xml">XML document</a>. A Javascript function then parses this result, modifies the structure of the current page, and displays the result <em>without having to reload the page</em>.</p>

<p>Now that's all well and good, but you'll notice a few <em>issues</em> perhaps. In the first instance, the URL displayed in the list of results (now shown above, if you clicked on the link) are broken. What seems to be happening is that when I create an anchor link, it is being set relative to the local directory. Now I'm not sure if this is down to me <s>(probably!) or an enforced security policy - as I'm doodling this offline, I can;t check just at the mo.</s> [yes, it was my problem, of course...the query returns a URL filled with ASCII character codes, so the URL isn't recognised as a URL*... An alternative approach I should have noticed would have been to parse the resource ID field, and then append the ID number to a URL stub...]</p>

<p>Anyway, it does bring at least one thing to my attention, which is that the ROUTES-XML feed is really messy... How much cleaner would it be if the ROUTES-XML links could:</p>

<p>a) all be made relative to a common root domain (http://routes.open.ac.uk, for example), and</p>

<p>b) cleaned up path-wise by using a redirect (e.g. redirecting from <em>ixbin%2Fhixclient.exe%3F_IXDB_%3Droutes%26_IXSPFX_%3Dg%26submit-button%3Dsummary%26%2524%2Bwith%2Bres_id%2Bis%2Bres<strong>nnnn</strong></em> to <em>routesID%2B<strong>nnnn</strong></em></p>

<p>* Here's the js fix, which should be applied to the URL:<br />
<tt>function unASCIIChars( s )<br />
{<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3A/g, ':' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%2F/g, '/' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3F/g, '?' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%3D/g, '=' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%26/g, '&' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%2B/g, '+' );<br />
 &nbsp;s = s.replace ( /%25/g, '%' ); <br />
 &nbsp;return s;<br />
}<br />
</tt></p>

<h3 class="title">Paced Content Delivery via RSS</h3>

<p>I just stumbled across this announcement (<a title="Surfarama  RSS for serialized content" href="http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242">Surfarama  RSS for serialized content</a>) about delivering an e-book to readers, a few pages a day, via RSS:</p>

<p><em>"[It]doesnt matter when you first subscribe, this feed will deliver the book to your feed reader in the right order, a couple of chapters a day, over the next month."</em></p>

<p>The idea has apparently surfaced a few times in the past (such as <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I think I like this, and I think I like it a lot. The mechansim provides one way of delivering paced content to users of elearning materials.</p>

<p>Rather than having to log on to an elearning providers site, the mechanism allows course content to be pushed to the student a bit a time, whioch might be attractive to informal learners.</p>

<p>The content arrives in your personal reader, so if the chunks are small enough, then a reader might well be able to work through the chunk there and then.</p>

<p>If a user is allowed to tune the delivery times (i.e. the times at which their RSS reader picks up the content) then they could ensure that content is delivered at an appropriate time.</p>

<p>Say you have a slow Tuesday afternoon most weeks? Then schedule a content pickup for lunchtime Tuesday. The content won't be languishing in your RSS reader marked as unread for days as you wait for your study day to come around. Instead, the content arrives at a time you said you'd be ready for it. </p>

<p>The two things I like about this idea, then, are:</p>

<ol><li>Getting learning content pushed to a user's personal space, as a result of the user subscribing to it, as opposed to publishing it to a 'private' VLE the student must log in to and only uses for their learning activities. This personal space idea is an important one, I think, as it embeds the learning material/content in channel's thaty users use to receive content on a daily basis. That is, we are embedding learning in everyday activity (which may or may not be effective practise? But is is <em>one way</em> of rethinking lifelong learning, in the sense of integrating learning into everyday activities.</li>
<li>Allowing users to schedule delivery/pickup of content for times when they are likely to be able to consume it*.</li></ol>

<p>*This reminds me of another thread that keeps appearing, about the downside of subscription and the overload that's now facing more and more of us as we subscribe to more and more feeds. Just as my mailbox has hundreds of emails in various states (read, unread, replied to, must reply to, etc. etc.), now my RSS feeds are starting to back up with unread, and increasingly ignored posts. The problem is of too much info.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps one way round this is for me to:</p>

<p>a) start filtering feeds a bit more;<br />
<em>and</em></p>

<p>b) start scheduling different feeds for pickup on different days, say. So I could have a CSS day, and a Web 2.0 day...?! This introduces a lag, sure, but it does block out in an architectural way the days on which particular things I'm subscribed to feed me new content. (I guess it's also a way of using technology to help me out with my lack of discipline!)</p>

<p><br />
And finally, a PS - in case you haven't heard, the <em>flock</em> "social browser" is now available as a <a href="http://www.flock.com/developer">developer\download</a>...<br />
</p>

<h3 class="title">RSS Ripples Within the OU...</h3>

<p>For some time, I've been looking round the OU for signs of RSS being used to publish and syndicate information, both administratively, and in the context of course delivery.</p>

<h3 class="title">Course News Widget Wants List</h3>

<p>A couple more thoughts on the <a title="OUseful Info: T184 News Konfabulator Widget" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004181.html">T184 News Konfabulator Widget</a> posted earlier, specifically, how to meake it <em>useable</em>...</p>

<p>As you may remember, the widget looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="newsWidgetOpen.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsWidgetOpen.jpg" width="286" height="183" border="0" /> <img alt="newsWidgetClosed.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsWidgetClosed.JPG" width="286" height="111" border="0" /></p>

<p>The only problem is - how do I know when there is there a <em>new</em> news story, particularly for the Course News feeds?</p>

<p>The use of a hot colour, or unread flag, are two possible options. This would highlight the name of the feed containing the unread item when the feed list is collapsed, and the unread items when it is open.</p>

<p>So - how does the widget know when an item has been acknowledged? For the Course News items, clicking on a link takes you to the Course Website, which requires a login. Which is why - if the news item is pithy enough, it usually just suffices to hover over the link to see if it is worth the effort logging in to read the whole story...</p>

<p><img alt="widgetNewsItem.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/widgetNewsItem.JPG" width="334" height="212" border="0" /></p>

<p>This means, of course, that you can't guarantee that the user will acknoldge a link by clicking it (though they might by hovering over it).</p>

<p>At first I imagined that what would probably be more useful would be to have an <em>Acknowledge</em> button that would mark as seen all open, highlighted news items. However, it may be better if each item was flagged witha flag, that could be clicked on to acknowldge the message.</p>

<p>Another alternative, perhaps, would be to link some news feeds into a widget such as the What to Do</em> widget that ships with Konfabulator (or perhaps the tidier <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/index.php?search=what+to+do&x=0&y=0">Mini-What To Do</a> widget).</p>

<p>This widget could pop up each new Course News item on your To Do list. Where the frequency of nes postings is low, this wouldn't be too much intrusion on day to day behaviour (assuming you use the To Do widget, of course!) whilst ensuring a reasonably high impact on attention when a new item is posted.</p>

<p><img alt="toDoClosed.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/toDoClosed.JPG" width="327" height="198" border="0" /> <img alt="toDoOpen.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/toDoOpen.jpg" width="321" height="222" border="0" /></p>

<p>As the title of this post suggests, I haven;t implemented any of these alerting systems yet... But I shall pop them on to my To Do list ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">T184 News Konfabulator Widget</h3>

<p>Picking up on an earlier post about making RSS feeds easy to consume, here is a Konfabulator <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/MultiNewsReader.widget">MultiNewsReader Widget (with a default T184 News feed)</a>.</p>

<p>The widget is 99.9% the <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/index.php?search=multinews&x=0&y=0">MultiNewsReader widget</a> by Gair Heaton, with the smallest of mods to replace the default news feed. </p>

<p>To try it out, you'll need to install <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/download">Konfabulator</a>, followed by the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/MultiNewsReader.widget">widget</a>. Once installed, it should look something like this...</p>

<p><img alt="newsWidget.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/newsWidget.JPG" width="256" height="205" border="0" /></p>

<p>How easy is that? No need to set up a news reader, or login to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> (or whatever your preferred online RSS aggregator happens to be). Just a net connection and a bit of space on your desktop for the widget.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to add other relevant (or even <em>Relevant Knowledge</em>...) feeds to the reader, such as a search of news stories on <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=robot*&ie=UTF-8&output=rss">robot*</a>  from the new <a href="http://news.google.com/intl/en_nz/news_feed_terms.html">Google news RSS feeds</a>... </p>

<p>If you prefer, you can limit the search options to just retrieve news stories from your preferrred news agency, such as the BBC. Just make use of the <em>source:</em> switch, as in this search for <a href="http://news.google.com/news?svnum=10&as_scoring=r&hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=&as_mind=11&as_minm=7&as_maxd=10&as_maxm=8&q=computer-virus+OR+firewall+OR+spam+OR+phishing+source:bbc_news&output=rss">BBC news stories (<em>source:bbc_news</em>) about <em>computer-virus OR firewall OR spam OR phishing</em></a>, which may be of interest to <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t187.htm">T187</a> students (<a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t187/html/index.htm">course taster here</a>), for example...</p>

<h3 class="title">RSS2PDF - Yet Another Publication Route</h3>

<p>I've not really given much though to how RSS may be used to deliver course materials, but any delivery mechanism should provide students with a printable version if the material isn't too online interactive for print.</p>

<p>So when I stumbled across <a title="RSS2PDF.ORG The non commercial version PDF from XML, RSS, FEED RSS2PDF RSS2PDF.ORG" href="http://www.rss2pdf.org/">rss2pdf.org</a>, another piece of the jigsaw appeared...</p>

<p>Specifically, here's a service that does exactly what is says on the box. And what this means is the ability to effortlessly publish blog postings (for example) in a printable, paginated format, with branding if required, and no webpage navigational clutter. (For an example, here's a <a href="http://www.rss2pdf.org/rss2pdf/?feed=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/index.rdf&type=rss">PDF of this blog</a>). </p>

<p>At the current time, there don't appear to be any working/reliableWiki2PDF converters on the web, but I'm sure they won't be long in coming...</p>

<p>So - why's it interesting. Well, as XML production routes open up, it means the potential for a wide variety of authoring environments feeding in to production processes that feed off XML. And using blogs to source print material may be attractive for a rapid publishing model.</p>

<p>The bottleneck, of course, is getting incoming XML into a format that the production process likes, which means that the incoming XML should ideally be capable of marking up documents at least as richly as the desired production format (if that richness is called for, of course).</p>

<p>Just by the by, it would be useful if blogging environments started publishing RSS versions of each individual post, e.g. on the permalink page for a post, as well as the <em>most recent N stories</em> feed, so that users could just take away individual stories as a PDF... </p>

<p>PS A few new bookmarklets for the RSS2PDF service have just crossed my radar (you can find them <a href="http://rss2pdf.com/bookmark.php">here</a>). They include RSS2PDF (with or without images) for a displayed raw RSS page, as well as a pair of autodiscovery RSS2PDF bookmarklets (again, one for pages with images, one for pages without). </p>

<p>Just a quick note as I grab a coffee on a sitemap extension I've made to the index profile of this blog... </p>

<p>In response to the announcement of <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login">Google Sitemaps</a> (which I've also written about in a Micro-Info post on <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/06/towards-skeletal-web.html">Towards the Skeletal Web</a>) I made the mods suggested in <a title="Niall Kennedy's Weblog: Google Sitemaps using Movable Type" href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/06/google_sitemaps.html">Niall Kennedy's Weblog: Google Sitemaps using Movable Type</a> to produce an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sitemap.xml">XML sitemap of this blog</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Embedding RSS Search...</h3>

<p>If the combination of RSS and search is to be widely used, it has to be easy to implement...</p>

<p>So here's a test - I have a working RSS feed from the OU search engine, I have an RSSViewer script on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful</a> pages somewhere that will take a feed and embed it in a page, so surely I should just be able to plug them together, and e.g. embed a search of the OU on the term "technology"...?</p>

<p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUSearchScraperRSS.php?q=technology"></script></p>

<p>Easy peasy....</p>

<p>Next step, of course, is to use a proper search box...</p>

<p>Anyway - if you want to embed an OU keyword search query'n'results in your own webpage, here's some code (just replace KEYWORD with whatever your keyword happens to be...or use several, separated with + signs (and no spaces)   at the end of the query...  </p>

<p><em>&lt;script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUSearchScraperRSS.php?q=search+engine" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em></p>

<p>It's just as easy to do the same with an OU library search, of course...</p>

<p>First the code you'll need:</p>

<p><em>&lt;script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSS.php?q=technology" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em></p>

<p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSS.php?q=technology"></script></p>

<h3 class="title">...and here's an RSS feed from the Library catalogue</h3>

<p>Good fun this perl stuff, or at least at the naive level at which I'm using it...</p>

<p>Anyway, having got one RSS feed generator going, it doesn't take much to do another... so here's the OU Library Voyager catalogue searching on the keyword <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/library/technology"><em>technology</em></a> and giving me the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSS.php?q=technology">first 10 results back as RSS</a>.</p>

<p>Now, what else is there out there..? :-)</p>
