<h3 class="title">Changing Expectations: Educational Publishing</h3>

<p>If you follow any North American edublogs, you probably can't fail to have noticed a whole flurry of recent posts on "Edupunk". Capturing the spirit of the times, <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/">Jim Groom</a>'s call to arms last week inspired many, confused some, and even offended a few... There's a wealth of good posts on the topic, of which I've especially liked <a href="http://arynna.umwblogs.org/2008/06/01/edupinions/">EDUPINIONS</a> (for the student voice), <a href="http://injenuity.com/archives/186">@Injenuity</a> for the zen-like response, question setting <a href="http://www.chrislott.org/2008/05/28/edupunk-or-eduhacker/">edupunk or eduhacker</a>, and <a href="http://www.dougbelshaw.com/2008/05/30/are-you-an-edupunk-im-not/">Doug Belshaw</a> (for not liking it at all;-) The <a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3045/frustrated-with-corporate-course-management-systems-some-professors-go-edupunk">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> need thanking for legitimising the term to the extent it helped get it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edupunk">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2008/06/defending-edupunk.html">Downes</a> for providing some clarification and <a href="http://www.darcynorman.net/2008/05/28/on-edupunk/">D'ArcyNorman</a>, who <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2538449892/">seriously freaked some of us out on Saturday morning</a>... If it's a badge you're after, <a href="http://edtechpost.wikispaces.com/edupunk+merit+badges">Scott Leslie's done 'em...</a>;-) (but who's doin' the t-shirts?;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, stuck for a way of putting together a 5 minute presentation to a group of educational publishers on the topic of "Changing User Expectations: Finding and Using Content" that was (is) to be delivered in my absence this coming Friday (the CRiG Barcamp invite came first...;-), I took heart from Jim's rallying cry and put together a little something that I hope captures something of the energy and spirit of eduPunk, howsoever you want to define it or capitalise it...;-)</p>

<p>The following works best on full screen view and with the volume turned up LOUD!</p>

<p>(The original swf file came in at 21 MB and can be found <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/presentations/changingExpectations.swf">here</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/046651.php">Brian Lamb</a> and <a href="http://andremalan.net/">@ramcio</a> for sorting out the format translation and posting the movie to blip. I owe you one, guys:-) If you want to embed it (feel free:-) and would rather have a Youtube version, here's <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0"><em>changing expectations</em> on Youtube</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the mix tells it's own story...though I will post some notes to back it up later in the week.</p>

<p>It was put together on a Mac, using Keynote, with handcrafted timings. The original swf file was generated by loading the soundtrack into the presentation, and then exporting the presentation (with soundtrack) as a standalone, free playing presentation. To synch the slides and the audio, I set the presentation running from the first slide in whatever sequence I was working on, and played the music from an appropriately located start marker in Audacity. The original plan had been to create the whole mix in iMovie (which I've never used before), but inspiration failed me for the best way to create the slides... So I went into Keynote (looking for iMovie integration features) and ended up staying there... For a 4m 15s or song, I reckoned about 3s per slide, requiring around about 85 slides. I actually created 100 or so, including slides for each of the lyrics, which were copied from a random lyric server website, then edited the visuals down. All in all, it took about 6 and a half hours (including a quick dog walk for inspiration;-) Finding the images took a surprisingly long time... (mainly using flickr, with a Creative Commons licence search limit).</p>

<p>Next time, I figure on trying something like Jumpcut...?<br />

<p>Loved the movie (and its soundtrack). Here's a trackback (is that the right word?) to a repost that I made on the Swansea University e-learning Community Blog. Interestingly, I picked up the link via Abject Learning after following up on your repost of the Distributed Publishing screencast before I reached your original article in the RSS feed (which I have set to read in Chronological order). I love this web stuff .. but doesn't it take a lot of time?!</p>
