<h3 class="title">Encouraging Online Engagement with Wikis</h3>

<p>In <a title="OUseful Info: Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Software" href="./004403.html">Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Software</a> I discussed the motivation for the use of social software in encoraging online, student engagment in distance education. In this post, I shall consider how we might use <em>wikis</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikis</a> are straightforward to use, social publishing environments for the co-creation of web pages displayed according to a common design template. In their purest form, anybody can edit a wiki page, although it is possible to configure some wiki’s with a  variety of read and write permissions. (NB it would of course be possible to host an ‘open’ wiki behind SAMS so that only – but any – students on a particular course could access it.)</p>

<p>Wikis typically provide comprehensive roll-back facilities allowing users to undo edits by other users (this provides a straightforward mechanism for clearing a wiki of graffiti, for example).</p>

<p>Some wiki’s provide WYSIWYG editors, other require the user to write pages using a simple, though sometimes arcane, form of markup. Creation of new pages, linked to from existing pages, is straightforward.</p>

<p>Some wiki’s support the syndication (and hence reuse) of content by providing an XML output of content pages.</p>

<p><strong>Wikis – Potential Use within an Electronically Delivered Masters Course</strong></p>

<p>There are several possible uses of wiki’s within courses that require online student access.</p>

<p>For example, a wiki may be used as <a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/perth04/procs/augar.html">an icebreaker activity</a>, or as a discussion environment in a way that contrasts markedly with a conferencing thread: conference threads may evolve either with, or without, quoted text from previous messages contained in follow-up posts, one post might spawn conversations (within the same thread) that elaborate on different points, and which get confused in a simple threading system, and so on.</p>

<p>In a wiki, a conversation can evolve in a linear, or hypertext fashion over a period of time, yet individual contributions can still be identified though the history mechanism providing useful information for markers of assignments produced by student groups, for example. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/wikiAnimate.html">Animation tools</a> allow users to see how a conversation developed over time (again based on the history mechanism) and thus gain a feeling for the interest a particular topic raised (much like being able to identify in a conference the well-discussed threads).</p>

<p>Wiki’s may also be used to provide a mechanism by which students create content that may be used in future presentations of a course – for example, by producing case studies or work through discussions of example software programs.</p>

<p>It would be particularly interesting to explore the possibility of using a wiki as a discussion  environment, where ‘documents’ are constructed as a result of a conversation between participants, as well as a more traditional’ collaborative authoring environment within which several people collaboratively work together to produce a single, coherent document.</p>

<p>For example, experience from <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t396">T396</a> suggests that students use conferences to solicit help from CT and each other with regard to understanding how to achieve particular things within the Flex programming language. Whilst software documentation and programming examples are provided as part of the course, it is often simple examples produced in answer to particular queries that are most successful in pedagogical terms.</p>

<p>Whilst conference threads can be useful for promoting a discussion ‘in real time’, with students reading each new post in an evolving thread (and where real time therefore plays a part in constructing – or maintaining – the narrative flow), it can be a laborious exercise to extract the key information post hoc from a long thread replete with acknowledgement posts (“thanks for that”, “ah, now I see”) as well as ‘contentful’ posts.</p>

<p>In contrast, the structure imposed by the wiki (or the target of any collaboratively authored document) does away with the possibility of content repeated (i..e quoted) from thread post to post and arguably encourages the construction of a post hoc readable (and hence reusable) document.</p>

<p>As well as offering the possibility of using the wiki to construct a ‘conversational document’. For example, see <a href="./004000.html">Online Student Engagement</a> for a document that was produced by editing multiple messages in a convoluted email thread.</p>

<p>My intuition is that this sort of thing could be imagined to be the result of a ‘wiki conversation’ rather than being constructed post hoc by editing a series of email messages). Some wikis provide discussion pages that sit ‘behind’ (or alongside) content pages, as with the page history information. These discussion pages allows multiple authors to comment on the reasoning behind changes to a content page, and thus offer a ‘reflective space’ or ‘meta page’ within which discussion about the construction or continued evolution of (i.e. changes to) a content page may take place.</p>

<p><hr />Example Activity.</p>

<p>Imagine that you work as part of a team in small company that transfers technology from academia into industry.<br />
  <br />
In your tutor group, use social bookmarks or other ways to identify a recent academic research paper that describes the use of fuzzy logic or Bayesian reasoning in an industrial or business application.</p>

<p>As a group, create one or more wiki pages that review the application area and the techniques used in the paper. Also discuss how you might go about reimplement the application using FLINT, giving examples of the sorts of rule that might go into the program.<hr /></p>

<p>There is even potential in encouraging students to participate in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity">Wikiversity</a> project, since individual contributions can be identified with registered users. Peer review of a student's work by other Wikepedia users, for example, would provide not only informal assessment of the student's work (incorrect or badly written submissions would be removed or corrected) but also feedback via comments/discussion, as well as <em>post hoc</em> edits.</p>

<p>Getting students to <em>deliver</em> assessable material into a living knowledge network also adds a sense of realism - and use value - to the assessment (although the student could, for example, also submit their original work via a normal submission route).</p>

<p>Assessing students 'in the wild' would raise some eyebrows, undoubtedly, although it is possible that the long tail of the web would be necessary for submissions to Wikipedia, for example, to be evaluated by ther contributors. However, what if the students were to contribute to, and/or revise the OU's corpus of legacy teaching materials? By opening up small areas of relevant content for students to work on, it may be possible to pick the best year on year and feed it into future versions of the course, an approach advocated elsewhere as <a href="http://teachandlearnonline.blogspot.com/2005/06/pay-it-forward-courses-on-wiki.html">Pay-it-forward Learning</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Bookmarks</h3>

<p>In <a title="OUseful Info: Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Software" href="./004403.html">Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Software</a> I discussed the motivation for the use of social software in encoraging online, student engagment in distance education. In this post, I shall consider how we might use <em>social bookmarking</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Social bookmarking tools such as <a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> are web-based services that allow registered users to save references (‘bookmarks’) to electronic resources (typically) and index, or tag, these references with personally meaningful terms (i.e. keywords, or tags).</p>

<p>The primary social element comes from being able to inspect the bookmarks other users have saved, or resources that have been saved with a particular (set of) tag(s) across all users or by a particular user.</p>

<p>In addition, some services (such as <em>Connotea</em>) allow bookmarks to be designated as private to an individual (and as such are not publicly viewable). With the additional ability to define groups containing particularly registered users, links to certain resources can be shared just with a group. Another nice feature of Connotea is that the publication of bookmarks to a public audience can be embargoed until a certain, specified date.</p>

<p>A second social dimension is provided by the ability to syndicate lists of bookmarks (as associated with particular users, tags etc.) using RSS. Using an <a href="http://rss-to-javascript.com">RSS-to-javascript</a> conversion service, it is straightforward to render a list of ‘live bookmarks’ (which I have referred to elsewhere as <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/livelinks/">Live Links</a>) within an arbitrary web page.</p>

<p><script language="JavaScript" src="http://convert.rss-to-javascript.com/?src=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%2Frss%2Fpsychemedia%2Flivelinks%2F"><br />
</script><noscript>Your browser does not support JavaScript. <a href='http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/livelinks'>Click to see the list of links</a>.</noscript></p>

<p>The use of LiveLinks of various flavours is being piloted within an online <a href="http://nagty.open.ac.uk/">academic study group</a> we will soon be running for the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY).</p>

<p><strong>Social Bookmarking – Potential Use within an Electronically Delivered Masters Course</strong></p>

<p>There are several opportunities for using social bookmarking within a course that requires an online presence (even if it is only for conferencing or accessing the student desktop) that can be viewed in terms of student-use or course team use.</p>

<p>Examples of student use of online and social bookmarking includes:</p>

<ol><li>private use by individuals to bookmark and tag (i.e. index) online resources;</li>
<li>sharing links between members of a group, or the course cohort as a whole, on topics of particular relevance to a particular section of the course, or the course subject area in general.</li></ol>

<p><hr /><em>Sample TMA 1 Question – Researching Expert System Applications:</em></p>

<p>Several academic journals and conferences focus on the development and application of expert systems. These include X, Y, Z. Using an appropriate search tool, identify three or more papers that relate to the use of expert systems in the following areas: a) medicine; b) law; c) industrial fault diagnosis.<br />
Bookmark your references within Connotea and tag and comment on them appropriately (?50 words or so each), embargoing their publication until time T (after TMA submissions deadline).</p>

<p>Export three of the references and submit them in an appropriate format (?along with comments?) as your answer to this question. Note that you will draw upon these bookmarks in the next TMA.<hr /><br />
<em>Sample TMA 2 Question – Researching Expert System Applications Redux:</em></p>

<p>Recalling the similarly themed question in the previous TMA, try and identify three more papers for each topic that have been bookmarked by other students on the course by looking at the records tagged with appropriate search terms. Once again, bookmark and comment on these papers for yourself within Connotea, export the bibliographic records ?and comments? and submit them as you answer, along with short references to the papers you identified in TMA 1.<hr /></p>

<p>Note that this form of two part question can be reused year on year in this course, or other courses, by changing the topic areas, and perhaps by explicitly stating (different) search databases year on year. Also, although the second TMA develops on from the first, students who didn’t do the first are not necessarily disadvantaged in the second. Customisation of assessment is also possible, e.g. where students may be provided with the search topic areas personally (so one may get law, medicine, industrial fault diagnosis, another may get medicine, archaeology, computer troubleshooting etc.).</p>

<p>Examples of CT use of bookmarks includes:</p>

<ol><li>For sharing links to potential resources amongst the CT during course production;</li>
<li>Providing links to current news items on the course subject area;</li>
<li>Supporting the use of LiveLinks within course materials consumed while the student also has a live internet connection at the time and point of use (although the course materials may be delivered from a course webserver, or via a CD-ROM or DVD_ROM, for example);</li>
<li>As a source of links for a course material updating tool, e.g. where the teaching materials are delivered via a DVD-ROM or USB memory stick.</li></ol>

<p>More generally, the use of an online bookmarking tool in general provides an alternative way of allowing students to use customised services such as <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a>.<br />

<h3 class="title">Encouraging Online Engagement with Social Software</h3>

<p>In a previous post (<a title="OUseful Info: Online Student Engagement" href="./004000.html">OUseful Info: Online Student Engagement</a>) I blogged a conversation about some of the issues related to getting students to engage with online activities.</p>

<p>What follows in this post, and the two blog posts that will come directly after it, is a first attempt at thinking through how how we might use wikis and social bookmarking in an online, distance education course in a way that encourages students to engage online.</p>

<p>To set the scene, then, what's the motivation for using <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html">social software</a>?</p>

<p>I'll keep this introductory post deliberately brief on the outside chance that is sparks some amount of confernce or Trackbacked discussion.</p>

<p>So what are some of the possible reasons for using these technologies in a distance education setting?</p>

<ol><li><em>Online engagement:</em> One significant aim here is to find ways of increasing levels of online social engagement between students. In addition, we need to find ways of encouraging students to develop their information and research skills, for example by helping them develop search skills via our online library facilities.</li>
<li><em>Knowledge sharing skills development:</em> Develop knowledge sharing skills and an awareness of knowledge sharing tools. Social software is not yet a proven technology for promoting knowledge sharing and co-working, but it has greqat potential as the much lauded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> wiki, and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> social bookmarking sites show.</li>
<li><em>Course maintenance:</em> Identify mechanisms for allowing long-lived course materials to maintain currency in fast moving subject areas. Maintaining a course year on year can present a significant overhead, so one possible aim here is to find mechanisms whereby course team academics can easily feed contemporary information sources into a course over a period of years.</li>
<li><em>Co-creation of content:</em> Identify mechanisms for capturing student created materials, particularly in developing case studies and software programming examples. This approach may also have a role to play in keeping course content frexh over time, or seeding/drafting new content for course revisions.</li></ol>

<p>To promote discussion (hopefully) I'll blog a few preliminary thoughts about the use of wikis and social bookmarking in a separate post for each (to get them, you should be able to use the Trackback link at the end of this post). <br />

<h3 class="title">Reverse ROUTES</h3>

<p>A passing comment in my <a title="OUseful Info: OU Course Info Search" href="./004395.html">previous post</a> inspired the following thought that I'd lose if I didn't blog it now...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">OU MyOpenLibrary</a> personalisation service offers, among other things, a Google search option I think (though I couldn't find one for <a href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk/">EEVL</a> on my account, which I thought was an automation oversight).</p>

<p>So  - if I search Google and get a bunch of links back, then would it be worth checking to see if this are cited as useful links for a particular course on ROUTES?</p>

<p>Or if ROUTES moved over to a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=social+routes">Social ROUTES</a> approach, the Google links could all be cross-checked to see if they have been bookmarked in Social ROUTES with any course tags.</p>

<p>Why bother? Well, it's an almost effortless way of offering up a targeted course advert, based on courses that have been related to the objects of a student's more general search by students doing those courses (or resources identified as relevant to the course by the CT).</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Info Live Search?</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I read a lot of Library blogs is not because that's where the cutting edge of disseminating information is*, but because they occasionally report about nifty catalogue interfaces...</p>

<p>[* IMHO ;-) many libraries appear to fight against adopting standards and strategies the real world uses, because they are, perhaps, a bit ropey in terms of classification and metadata compared to what information professionals are used to, or at least, compared to what they expect to use...]</p>

<p>The OU has several catalogues, of course, of which perhaps the most important in 'sales' terms  is the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?A02">OU course catalogue</a>. </p>

<p>I have in the past tried tinkering with very unofficial not quite extensions to this service, such as the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/courseSearch.php">OUseful course search</a> (which I still need to provide a search interface form for, although I have exposed a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/webService.php">SOAP web service interface</a> to it),  the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful Course Book Search</a> (which allows you to search for books associated with OU courses) or an easy to remember <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/redirects.php">redirect</a> to the course choice pages).</p>

<p>However, one thing I haven't looked at is a <em>live search</em> in which the results are displayed as you type (for example, try out the live search <a href="http://1976design.com/blog/">this blog</a>).</p>

<p>Live search would be a cool toy, if nothing else, if applied to the OU catalogue, or indeed the OU Voyager library catalogue (and I guess, my OUseful search tools...).</p>

<p>Here's an example of what a <a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2005/09/quick_searching.html">bibliographic database</a> live search interface might look like, for eample (look for the link to the <em>movie</em>).</p>

<p>Live search is interesting to me in part because:</p>

<p>1) it's predictive;</p>

<p>2) you get a feel, as you type, for whether your search is going where you want it to;</p>

<p>3) before the predictive element starts to work properly, there is the possibility of a serendipitous find <em>on the way to</em> the actual target of  your search.</p>

<p>If the OU is to open up some of it's content (and I hope to post more on this in the next week or two)  then helping people find and reuse it (as well as remixing it) will become increasingly important.</p>

<p>Cross-linking course books and ROUTES resources  with course codes will also allow for a much expanded search engine, which will cast a wider net of search terms over the courses we offer. By which I mean, if your search hits on a book that is used in a particular course, for example, then you can return the course as an associated, or related link.</p>

<p><em>PS Searching legacy content/teaching materials <em>internally</em> is also an issue that doesn't appear to have been addressed yet, although the much heralded new ECM system may offer this facility...</p>

<p>I dream of the day when we let Google Print scan all our legacy content/materials from expired courses, so that internally at least we can use it as a teaching material encycolpedia, and perhaps even get to reuse the some of the content (I suspect one of the reasons we don't reuse content much is because we can't find it/don't know it exists...). It would be nice if the old content was wikified, too, so that we could start to use it as living material and perhaps get a community co-revising, or co-maintaining (rather than strictly co-creating) the materials, but I suspect that's too much to wish for...</em></p>
