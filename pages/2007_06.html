<h3 class="title">(Not?) Talking about Multimedia</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I put together <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html">We Ignore Digital Media at OU Peril - the Movie</a> earlier in the week is that it occurred to me that the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html">original post</a> was too long for a blog post really. Many people skim blogs for a quick info fix, but to go through the original post comprehensively would take about an hour if you watched the movies and followed all the links.</p>

<p>The movie is not much quicker to watch - but it is a different "user proposition": in this case, a (longish) video show...</p>

<p>It also occurred to me that we make HUGE assumptions about how our students spend time consuming our materials; if we have them for two hours at a time, or even for 1 hour, that would be a huge privilege. I have some reason to believe (;-) that some students on our online courses spend on average 15 minutes per visit to the course website (though I'm not sure how representative that simple average (mean, I think) is of the actual time spent on the site by actual individuals).</p>

<p>Many of our course materials are written with different size chunks in them - readings that take an hour, exercises that take half an hour, SAQs that take maybe 5 mins, maybe longer etc.</p>

<p>BUT there is no way a student can easily grab a bundle of 5 min chunks to consume while they're waiting at the bus stop, for example.</p>

<p>I think  - if we're clever - we may be able to chunk content in such a way that is can be packaged as shorts - a five minute clip with a bit of supporting text to frame why we're using the clip/what we want students to try and get out of the clip/what we want them to think about while they are watching it - or bundling those shorts into a longer package that generates its own momentum and keeps you engaged for a longer study period.</p>

<p>That is, I feel there ought to be a way we can come up with a menu of learning items that can be "snacked on" throughout the day, or sat down to for a full all-in-one-sitting "meal".</p>

<p>(Retaining the food imagery, the <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/">'Ever Wondered About Food?'</a> OU/BBC programme works like that, I think. A half hour program on a single topic/theme, with individual packages that each last 5/6 mins(?) and can be shown as standalone shorts, if required? Just in passing, several episodes of Ever Wondered About Food? also happen to be available as MP3 downloads: <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/podcasts.html">ever wondered about food? "podcast" page</a>. )</p>

<p>My formal training in media studies etc is zero - so this may all be so much nonsense. But then again, developing visual narrative skills internally, and via course offerings, is something I think we should be doing, so I'm happy to be self-experimenting on this... ;-)</p>

<p>Although something like the "peril movie" is NOT meant to demonstrate a potential vehicle for delivery (or assessment) in its current format - there is arguably too little critical analysis for that (although finding appropriate movies can be difficult at times) - it is partly intended  to offer a start to ways in which we might explore how several multimedia clips from the web can be bundled into a chunk that lasts 10 mins,  20 mins, 30 mins, an hour etc. with textual inserts used to hint at a narrative structure.</p>

<p>I mailed some of the above comments around various people internally, as well as to the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/eating/">EATING</a> group (ha! - food again...;-) and it turned up in response a few pointers to people who were already experimenting with such things.</p>

<p>It also turned up a couple of multimedia annotation tools that are being explored for potential use in the context of a particular online open content project...<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://diver.stanford.edu/what.html">DIVER</a>: "DIVER is a tool for authoring and sharing DIVES. A DIVE is an annotated perspective on any video record. Content can be captured by equipment ranging from basic consumer video cameras to specially built, high-resolution 360-degree panoramic cameras with a multi-microphone array."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.matrix.msu.edu/~mmatrix/">[mediamatrix]</a>: "MediaMatrix is an online application that allows users to isolate, segment, and annotate digital media."</li></ul></p>

<p>Internal readers may also like to check out the <a href="https://intranet-gw.open.ac.uk/lts/production-process/9500_media.htm">video narrative explorer</a> developed for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/da204">Understanding Media</a> course, as well as the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/observationskills/p4_5.shtml">fOCUs video annotation tool</a> developed for an observational psychology course (<em>why</em> is there no video demo of this available...?!)</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to explore the various tools that are out there for cobbling together video resources from public sources, here are a few more to get you started:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.vuvox.com/">Vuvox</a>, a online presentation builder. Add flickr photos, youTube movies etc to a customised online presentation;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.scenemaker.net/">Scenemaker</a> lets you edit <em>any</em> YouTube movie, whereas the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ytremixer_about">"official" YouTube Remixer</a> (built on top of Adobe Premiere Express, which also underpins the <a href="http://press.photobucket.com/blog/2007/03/remix_service_a.html">Photobucket online movie remix tool</a>... hmmm....) only lets you edit/remix your <em>own</em> movie uploads (at the moment...).</li><br />
<li><a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a>, the service I used to deliver the peril movies. Add multiple YouTube movies to a show in one go if they are on the same page (like a playlist page...), Powerpoint presentations (each slide becomes a separate image - handy if you want ot rearrange them or insert movies etc.), Flickr images and even PDFs...</li></ul></p>

<h3 class="title">Making Sense of the Web - Semantic Search Optimisation</h3>

<p>A jumble of thoughts as I ease into the day, starting with a phrase that occurred to me walking the dog last night...</p>

<p>I'd just picked up an email from <a href="http://downes.ca">Stephen</a> relating to <a href="http://wikimindmap.com">wikimindmap</a>, which I'd rehashed to display an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010443.html">OpenLearn Unit navigation in mindmap format</a> .</p>

<p>Stephen commented that a tension arises when displaying a link collection scraped from a page in a simple hierarchy, because not all links are equal: "Two links look the same to a wiki, but to a concept map one is a major link while the other is minor, subsidiary."</p>

<p>I agree with this, but still think there's mileage in starting <em>somewhere</em> and then seeing how we can improve matters through structure, or cunning...</p>

<p>The semantic web <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_web_road.php">may</a> or <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/the_future_of_w_1.html">may not</a> be just around the corner.</p>

<p>What struck me whilst walking the dog was where the semantics could be applied. I've just read David Weinberger's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Miscellaneous-Power-Digital-Disorder/dp/0805080430/?tag=ouseful-21">Everything is Miscellaneous</a>, where he writes at length about <em>sorting on the way out</em> rather than <em>indexing on the way in</em>.</p>

<p>You can listen to an <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1838.html">interview with David Weinberger on IT Conversations</a> (how come IT Conversations <em>don't</em> having sharing/embed code??),  see the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2159021324062223592&hl=en">book tour presentation at Google TechTalks</a>:</p>

<p><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=2159021324062223592&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed></p>

<p>or see <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=514373">David Weinberger in conversation with Bradley Horowitz</a> via the YUI Theatre:</p>

<p><embed src='http://us.i1.yimg.com/cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/player/media/swf/FLVVideoSolo.swf' flashvars='id=2686298&emailUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.yahoo.com%2Futil%2Fmail%3Fei%3DUTF-8%26vid%3D514373&imUrl=http%253A%252F%252Fvideo.yahoo.com%252Fvideo%252Fplay%253Fei%253DUTF-8%2526vid%253D514373&imTitle=A%2BConversation%2Bwith%2BDavid%2BWeinberger&searchUrl=http://video.yahoo.com/video/search?p=&profileUrl=http://video.yahoo.com/video/profile?yid=&creatorValue=ZXJpY21pcmFnbGlh&vid=514373' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='425' height='350'></embed></p>

<p>"Sorting on the way out, rather than indexing on the way in..."</p>

<p>It struck me that if we get regular expressions in search queries (as in Google code search), then it becomes possible to write quite complex filters that over time will give some approximation to semantic search, whilst being incrementally useful.</p>

<p>So for example, with regular expression for a postcode or zipcode applied as a search limit, I could narrow down on "where is" type queries (in the US and UK at least!).</p>

<p>For some time, many of the search engines have been supporting question asking/fact returning queries (for example: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+england">population of England</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=capital+of+france">capital of france</a> (see more examples on the <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/106431"><em>In Search of Google</em> playlist</a>)).</p>

<p>It seems to me that  by providing regular expressions, as well as search limits that employ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_search_(text)">proximity search</a> (that is, looking for terms that are near each other), expert users will be increasingly able to issue "semantic queries", albeit phrased in arcane language and specifying the <em>form</em> or <em>structure</em> of the desired answer.</p>

<p>Like looking in the library for books with a blue spine... we put the shape of the answer we want into the query...</p>

<p>Now I know only too well that even today's advanced search tools are not that widely used (one reason we put the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google information literacy course</a> together), but using services like Yahoo pipes, it would be possible to produce a set of custom built 'semantic' filters that can be invoked using simple, hopefully easy to remember search limits. (Try typing just the word <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=movies">movies</a> into Google, for example: the first hit will be a list of movies showing near you (once you have provided a 'home' postcode...)</p>

<p>This is where <em>semantic search optimisation</em> comes in - optimising the text on the page so that it becomes amenable to "semantic" search filters, and allows searchers to write query filters that pick up on the desired shape of the results page - like the constraint it contains a zip code.</p>

<p>These are all baby steps I'm talking about - incremental innovations that may or may not (probably are) part of search engine voodoo magic - but things that can be picked up on by individuals and incorporated in their searches (if they know how.... hmmm... ;-)</p>

<p>Formally structured (standardised) URLs are also relevant in this context, not only for indexing and navigation via the address line, but also supporting the definition of advanced queries limited by URL structure (this is already partly possible using things like <em>filetype:</em>, page and domain search limits).</p>

<p>Read/Write Web picked up on this today: <a href"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/standard_urls_proposal.php">Standard URLs - Proposal for a Web with Less Search</a>, suggesting that "if there was a standard way to turn things into URLs, then finding information would be a lot easier".</p>

<p>They propose widespread adoption of standardised URL structures, but I'm not sure how plausible this is, unless publishing system developers get on bard (I could imagine a "blog standard URL structure", for example) or "URL protocols" along the lines of <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/sfx_openurl.htm">OpenURL</a>.</p>

<p>I could see a role for an intermediary URL rewriting service, however, that publishes a standard URL format, with an element specifiying a particular 'target' website, that rewrites URLs appropriately:</p>

<p>Users could then write URL 'queries' along the lines of : http://easypeasyurl.net/<strong>amazon</strong>/books/j-k-rowling/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire</em></p>

<p>In the library world, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">libezproxy</a> provides a good example of a widely used URL rewriting service.</p>

<p>(And don't forget the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/redirects.php">OUseful Redirects</a> page, or my suggestion for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009144.html">standardised OpenLearn URLs</a> ;-)</p>

<p><br />
PS Just by the by, whilst trying to track down a link I knew I'd visited today, it struck me how a <em>branching forward</em> listing would be useful in my browser; in one tab, I had gone <em>forward</em> from a delicious links page to a site (call it 'A' ;-), <em>back</em> to the links page, then forward to another delicious links page and on down another path.</p>

<p>When I wanted to revisit site 'A', I couldn't reach it via forward and back browser buttons (though I could go back to the branch point and see from clicked through links which one it was). What would be really neat would be for the forward and back browser buttons to implement at least a tree navigator for the whole of the session in that tab... or maybe even a fully blown graph navigator (that somehow depicts how you moved from one tree branch to another in a single step, for example...).</p>

<p>I need to sketch a mockup, don't I? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">We Ignore Digital Media at OU Peril - the Movie</h3>

<p>A quick tinker with <A href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> - maybe half an hour or so - and here's a "movie" version of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html">"When T293 had its last presentation in 2001...": We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</a> post. </p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/p/HJSH3537QK" wmode="transparent" width="400" height="300" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></p>

<p>If you can;t see the embedded movie player above, <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/preview/?s=IVTH3836KD">see the show here...</a></p>

<p>SplashCast has a neat feature that will import any YouTube movies it finds on a page, so the only thing I had to do to import the movies into the show was to pick the "Movies from YouTube" option, and paste in the URL of the original blog post...</p>

<p>Earlier this week, John Monk demoed some 30s assessment shorts, audio/visual clips on various topics that he was suggesting would be a good format for assessment.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>Maybe John will share his thoughts on YouTube, or via a Splashcast channel. John...?</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Custom Search on the Fly (just like searchfeedr....err?)</h3>

<p>Just spotted this on the <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2007/06/custom-search-on-fly.html">Google Custom Search Engine blog</a>, which I haven't visited for a while:<br />
<blockquote>You can now create a CSE by simply placing a small piece of tailored code on a page on your site. With that one piece of code, Google's search technology will automatically include in your new CSE all of the sites you have linked to from that page, creating a dynamic, powerful and tailored search experience really quickly. Moreover, your new CSE will update itself periodically to include any new links added to that page.</blockquote><br />
I experimented with something related to this as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007496.html">PageSearch</a>, the context that originally gave me the inspiration for the idea of naturally occurring <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005914.html">search hubs</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1072995/L.jpg" alt="pagesearch architecture" /></p>

<p>(Here's a link to the first time I wrote about it, I think: <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/11/rollyo-portable-pagelinks-search.html">Rollyo Portable? PageLinks Search</a>, on November 10th, 2005. Demos soon followed, of course... I also seem to remember mailing Rollyo about the idea at the time and got no reply. Are they in the deadpool yet, I wonder? Must check...;-)</p>

<p>The Google CSE goes a step further by allowing you to add links from pages to a growing search engine; in this way you can easily (effortlessly) build up a search engine that covers only and any sites you link to from a blog, for example.</p>

<p>I also experimented with ways of tuning the search, so users could <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007884.html">drop particular domains from the search results</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sfLabsStyle1.png" alt="searchfeedr interface" /></p>

<p>(Another thing to mention about searchfeedr is that is lets you search over the <em>pages</em> that are linked to from a particular page, or the domains those pages live on. Searchfeedr also gives you the choice of which search engine you want to use...)</p>

<p>Today, the Google Custom Search folks opened up an <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2007/06/custom-search-engine-apis.html">Google on-the-fly custom search engine API</a> that lets you define a "pagesearch" CSE via a URL.</p>

<p>I used a similar approach for searchfeedr - everything is handled via the URL, which makes writing bookmarklets easy and also means you can bookmark a particular search.</p>

<p>In addition to PageSearch, <em>searchfeedr</em> also demonstrated searches over the pages that linked <em>to</em> a particular page (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007588.html">linkSearch</a>):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1078412/L.jpg" alt="link search architecture" /></p>

<p>And of course, searchfeedr will also accept page URLs or domains as the search limits for a search via an RSS feed, originally prototyped as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005679.html">deliSearch</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1073001/L.jpg" alt="Searchfeedr architecture" /></p>

<p>Searchfeedr also attempts a bit of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007918.html">searchfeedr ESP</a> when you send it a URL <em>without</em> specifying a link search, page search or RSS/feed-powered search.</p>

<p>More recently, I've started Pipe-ifying the searchfeedr backend: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010000.html">searchFeedr Pipes</a>.</p>

<p>Come on Google - KEEP UP....</p>

<p>PS missed this in my quick skim of the most recent <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2007/06/custom-search-engine-apis.html">on-the-fly post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>You can use our makecse tool to generate CSEs from different sources of links:<br />
    * HTML: http://www.cs.berkeley/~russell/ai.html<br />
    * RSS: http://reddit.com/.rss<br />
    * ATOM: http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default<br />
    * OPML: http://medicalconnectivity.com/gems/blogroll.opml</blockquote><br />
Ho hum... I <em>knew</em> I should have spent a bit more time on Searchfeedr...</p>

<h3 class="title">Information At the Point of Inspiration...</h3>

<p>If you've ever been to a <a href="http://www.snap.com/about/shots.php">Snap<em>shots</em></a> enabled page, you'll be familiar with the idea of being able to pop up a preview of a page (or RSS feed items from the page, or WIkipedia page summaries etc.) by hovering your cursor over a link in the page. </p>

<p>I have to admit I have disabled the service in my browser - I find it way too irritating...! I do think that following a link into a pop-up light-box has great potential for certain sorts of link, though: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">Interaction Design: Now Follow this Link</a>.)</p>

<p>The Snap-shots tool (and others of its ilk) are love 'em or hate 'em services I think. I experimented with a tool in this vein some considerable time ago - <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">popup links</a> were intended to provided a shortcut way of linking to several items on a particular new story, but I never really pursued it:</p>

<p><img alt="popupLinks.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/popupLinks.jpg" width="538" height="290" border="0" /></p>

<p>(If I was tinkering with something similar now, I'd probably be pulling content in from a meme tracker...)</p>

<p>I also dabbled with an idea for being able to search over the links that were referenced in a page, or that linked to a page (demoed a couple of months later as <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a>), and could see all sorts of potential for services like <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000074.html">Y!Q contextual search</a>, which augmented Yahoo! searches made while viewing a particular page with additional contextual information.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway,Yahoo! just introduced something new to their mail service - <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000462.html">Yahoo! Shortcuts</a> - which is maybe interesting from an online, text heavy course material design point of view (where tooltip glossary items are often about as interactive as things get).</p>

<p>What Yahoo! Shortcuts do is sniff out particular sorts of information in a mail message, and linkify them in an appropriate way. For example, addresses suddenly become links to pop-up maps, and pop-ups to news summaries for particular organisations are also possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/map-screencapture.png" alt="Yahoo shortcut map popup screenshot" /></p>

<p>(Hmm - ok - a check of my old blog has a prototype for that too: <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/04/uk-postcode-linker-using-greasemonkey.html"> UK Postcode Linker Using Greasemonkey</a> - a Greasemonkey script that augments UK postcodes appearing in a page with links to a map. There are lots of other related  browser extension out there too.)</p>

<p>Google do something not totally dissimilar in Gmail - enabling document attachments to emails to be opened in Google docs (though not in a pop-up).</p>

<p>I guess what the Yahoo announcement did for me was to remind me about the possibilities for automatically augment pages with links to/pop-ups containing contextually relevant information.</p>

<p>Not overloading the page with links and pop-ups is something that needs to be borne in mind. But I could imagine a sidebar tool that allows you to enable the augmentation tools and then, when you hover (or hover and click over, or key press over) particular items in the page, the sidebar could be populated with relevant additional content.</p>

<p>From looking at my blog stats, I know readers rarely follow links; and course teams here don't get to see stats of how our students use our online materilas, so I have no way of knowing whether anyone clicks through outgoing links from <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>, for example. Whether things like Snap do improve click-thru, I don't know. But being able to engage people with what are essentially hypertext "footnotes" and "endnotes" is something we need to work on, I think?</p>

<p>Okay - so this is all a bit vague, and I guess I need to do a demo to work out exactly what it is I mean... but no time to do that at the moment (morning coffee break is over...;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">"When T293 had its last presentation in 2001...": We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</h3>

<p>I'm down to do a 15 minute slot on Tuesday at a scoping meeting for a new second level course, where the discussion will be on possible subject matter for each of the course blocks. One of the possible major themes for the course harkens back to a previous course - <em>T293 Communicating Technology</em> - which mixed the development of communication skills (presentations, teamworking, reading skills, and so on) with teaching about the technical side of telecommunication systems.</p>

<p>One of the areas I think we should be considering is data visualisation and interpretation. Thinking about how to make that argument, I got a sidetracked (!? - no surprise there, then ;-) with a more general view, relating to how we might start develop the use of digital media use and skills development in our courses.</p>

<p>The format of this piece is - as regular readers will have noticed - heavily influenced by <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>. It contains several embedded movies. If you are reading this through a feed reader, it's quite likely the movies won't appear - click through to see them. They help make sense of the story I want to tell...</p>

<p>[UPDATE: if you would rather watch a version of the following part of the post as a movie, rather than read through it/watch the embedded movies, tune in to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html"><em>We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</em> Splashcast show</a>.]</p>

<h2>We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</h2></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, let alone when it started, the democratisation of affordable and wide reaching technologies capable of producing and distributing rich media had hardly begun. At the T293 course residential school, an OHP was the way we presented our slides to students, and the way students made presentations to each other. Data projectors were still cumbersome and expensive and Powerpoint presentations, let alone the use of interactive whiteboards, had not made it into the course. Both of these technologies are now a mainstay of Primary School ICT education here in the UK.</p>

<p>Powerpoint <em>per se</em> will not, of course, guarantee a successful presentation...</p>

<p>.... although in the right hands, it can be a highly effective visual aid <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/clear_visuals_w.html">reinforce the presenter's message</a>.</p>

<p>(If you want to know just <em>how</em> to do that sort of presentation, here's a clue: <a href="ttp://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20040712/techspace01.shtml">Powerpoint <em>presenter view</em> and dual monitor displays</a>. For more on why you should only use <em>small</em> amounts of text on a presentation slide, check out <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010298.html">Powerpoint Presentations That Support Glanceability</a>.)</p>

<p>To get an idea of just how wide ranging presentation styles can be, check out  <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>.</p>

<p>Whether slides are any use <a href="http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/06/powerpoint-and-.html"><em>after the fact</em></a> is another matter...</p>

<p><em>We ignore digital presentation tools at our peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there were no social networks that had the popular reach of <a href="http://myspace.com">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://bebo.com">Bebo</a>, or <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. (If you have young kids  - ask them about <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/">Club Penguin</a>.) Want "proof"? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=facebook%2C+myspace%2C+%22club+penguin%22%2C+bebo%2C+%22open+university%22&ctab=0&geo=GB&date=all&sort=0">You got it</a>. ["Proof by Google" &trade; ;-)]</p>

<p>There are  - at the time of posting - one thousand five hundred and eighty members of "The Open University" group on Facebook.</p>

<p>If you <em>haven't</em> been listening, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook is making a play as a platform</a>, trying to create a social network ecosystem in the way that the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> platforms have built ecosystems around retail and auctions (and like UPS has built a <a href="http://www.ups-scs.com/">supply chain platform</a>, come to that...).</p>

<p>If you don't know what a platform is, <a href="http://blog.sethgoldstein.com/2007/06/11/facebook-foam/">WAKE UP</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore social networks and social technology platforms at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there were no large scale, easy to use sites for uploading and sharing personally generated media. No real <em>photo sharing</em> in the <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>-style, no <em>movie sharing</em> sites like <a href="http://youtube.com">youTube</a>. Want "proof'? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22photo+sharing%22%2C+%22video+sharing%22&ctab=0&geo=all&geor=all&date=all&sort=0">You got it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/online+photo+editor">Photo editing</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/online+photo+editor">video editing</a> tools were barely available <em>offline</em>, let alone <em>online</em>, and the thought of being able to remix "the source audio" of a commercial album using your own computer's preloaded mixing desk - think <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010108.html">Nine Inch Nails' Garageband release</a> - was virtually unimaginable.</p>

<p>Now it's possible to "do" digital storytelling using the tools you can find via your browser.</p>

<p>Err - digital storytelling??? Things like this, maybe:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLlGopyXT_g"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLlGopyXT_g" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Okay - so that's slick - but you can always use something like <a href="http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/2007/05/23/learning_programming_from_scratch">Scratch</a>, which does interactive games as well as simple multimedia animations.</p>

<p><em>We ignore "digital storytelling" at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, satellite television - and a few struggling cable TV companies - were the only alternative to the four (then five) free-to-air broadcast television channels in the UK. Digital radio was still in it's early days (and if truth be told, I suspect is still far from mainstream and further from exploiting its full potential).</p>

<p>Last week, I got an invite to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/">BBC Archive Trial</a>, which offers a glimpse into the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax">BBC back catalogue</a>; I already dabble with <a href="http://channel2.com/4od">Channel 4 On Demand</a>. <a href="http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=7785">ITV</a> have just started rolling out <em>their</em> online watch again service too, and <a href="http://www.btvision.bt.com/vision/index.htm">BT</a> are now getting into on-demand film delivery.</p>

<p>Then there are the pure internet plays too, of course: <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> and <a href="http://babelgum.com">Babelgum</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Want "proof"? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=tv+on+demand%2C+broadband+tv%2C+watch+again%2C+listen+again&ctab=0&geo=all&geor=all&date=all&sort=0"><em>Proof by Google</em> &trade;</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the changing nature of video distribution and consumption at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Didi I mention audio?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/progs/listenagain.shtml">BBC Listen Again</a> service provides access to a wide selection of radio content for seven days after it is broadcast, making home-taping unnecessary for 'listen once' activity <em>if</em> you can get to a browser within a week of a programme being broadcast. Many radio programmes and TV news clips also seem to be made <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=av&scope=all">available in perpetuity</a>. You can even edit some radio programmes and deep link into them using the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/findlistenlabel/help.html">Find, Listen, Label</a> tool.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://itunes.com">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, amongst others, demonstrate how offline and online audio consumption and distribution can be grown - and supported - purely via the internet. When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there was nothing around like either of these services.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the changing nature of audio distribution and consumption at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, computer gaming was HUGE, commercially. It still is.</p>

<p>As the mainstream engages in games that aren't - from <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> through <a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/">"flow"</a> to <a href="http://www.socialimpactgames.com/">serious games</a> - the <em>culture</em> surrounding gaming continues to grow, and the storyforms and methods of gameplay employed in games become entrenched in everyday pop culture.</p>

<p>"We" may "get" short stories, novels, two and three act plays, opera and ballet, maybe even abstract expressionism. But can you identify a game genre and the expected mode of gameplay at 50 paces in front of a hi-def, 40 inch plasma screen? Would you even begin to know what's expected of you as a player?</p>

<p>Oops - I forgot - games are interactive, and we do education... We just pour that knowledge into those empty vessel brains, don't we?</p>

<p><em>We <strong>continue</strong</em> to ignore computer gaming and interactive entertainment at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The world is increasingly awash with data. There is <em>no way</em> we can "explain it" all to our students. Instead, we need to find ways of helping OUr students explore data, mine it themselves, have <em>conversations</em> with it directly, and with each other about it.</p>

<p>The OU was one of the pioneers at an institutional level of the idea of the <em>tutorial in print</em>, engaging students through print material as if in they were in conversation with a tutor sat next to them.</p>

<p>In order to help OUr students make sense of data, we need to help them use the tools that allow them to ask questions of that data, and obtain appropriately visualised results in return.</p>

<p><a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">Gapminder</a> is one such beautiful (online) tool for visualising population and economic data.</p>

<p>Because I know most of you <em>won't</em> follow that link, here's an exquisite presentation showing Gapminder in action. The Gapminder demo starts 2.45 minutes in. I could deep-link to that point, but then you'll miss the first couple of minutes which set the scene about WHY this sort of display technology is so important...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RUwS1uAdUcI"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RUwS1uAdUcI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p><em>Social discussion</em> around data is important too, particular in an educational context. IBM's <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">Many Eyes</a> shows one possible way forward here. It not only provides a place to share data, it always provides a wealth of visualisation tools and social tools to rate and discuss visualisations.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the importance of developing data visualisation skills at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The web is a visual place (although it is also becoming an increasingly important channel for the delivery audio files). In academia, we tend to emphasise textual representations.</p>

<p>Assessment is dominated by textual submissions from our students, partly because we do not tend to develop visual presentation skills.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">Periodic Table of Visualization Methods</a> demonstrates a wide variety of graphical techniques for communicating information.</p>

<p>It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. How brave would a course team have to be to introduce a final assessment that required the submission of two infographics or a two minute digital story, rather than a couple of thousand words in reply to short and long question answers?</p>

<p><em>We ignore the development of visual communication skills at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Space is important too - we live in a 3D world and are familiar with how 3D works. Spatial relationships affect how we live out our daily lives. Geography is important. And geography is coming to the data web.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of RSS feeds (which you <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">ignore at your peril</a>), you probably won't have heard of geoRSS. (If you want to know what it is, Google or Wikipedia will tell you about it... That's where most of the rest of the world learn about the stuff they need - err, think they <em>want</em>? -  to know about...)</p>

<p>Here's a map that's powered by GeoRSS: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.online-archaeology.co.uk%2FGoogleMap%2FData%2FGenerateGeoRSS.aspx%3FCategoryID%3D64&ie=UTF8&z=4&om=1">English Civil War battles</a>. Using a service like the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/rss-to-georss-converter.html">GeoNames RSS to GeoRSS converter</a>, I can create <em>another</em> sort of file - a KML file - that will display the battlefield locations in <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a>.</p>

<p>You can also add 3D models to Google Earth using <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup</a>, of course, though at the moment, you have to pay to <a href="http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/ug_movies.html">record movies made inside Google Earth</a> if you don't want to use screen recorder software.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lkTMMJZI65M"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lkTMMJZI65M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>If you liked that, then you'll love <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSynth</a>, which stitches photos together to give photorealistic (indeed, photo generated) 3D models.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007032.html">Fotowoosh</a> will create a 3D model from a <em>single</em> photo. Remember Bladerunner?  Here's a walk inside a photo for real:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>The 3D web is coming, and it's not just Second Life...</p>

<p><em>We ignore the 3D web at our peril.</em></p>

<p>Undeniably, rich digital media surrounds us - as do the tools of its production.</p>

<p><em>"The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed."</em><br />
<em>OUr mission - should we choose to accept it - is to redistribute that future.</em><br />
<strong><em>We ignore digital media at OUr peril.</em></strong></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay - so that's turned out to be a bit more than 15 minutes worth of stuff - but it was fun to compile...</p>

<p>Now I just to use the above as resources for a bit of digital storytelling...</p>

<h3 class="title">Wikipeadia + OpenLearn?</h3>

<p>I spent huge chunks of today tinkering on and off with different combinations of Wikipedia and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010439.html">OpenLearn content in wikimindmap style</a> but none of it was very satisfactory. Here are a few things I noticed/tried along the way (nothing more substantial to report...):<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://wikimindmap.com">wikimindmap</a> uses a modifed version of the map widget, that handles special "wikilinks" that launch a new wikimindmap centred on a new topic;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php">Wikipedia has an API</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/query.php">query interface</a> (via <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-find-wikipedia-links/5169/">searchenginejournal.com</a>) that will return results via a JSON feed;</li><br />
<li>it's easy to add the Yahoo content analyser to a Yahoo pipe that feeds off an OpenLearn RSS feed (and then optionally use the returned terms as the basis of a Yahoo search over Openlearn or Wikipedia, for example) <em>but</em> non-RSS appended links don't seem to make it to the Yahoo Pipes output RSS feed - though they do appear in the JSON feed;</li><br />
<li>this <a href="http://goessner.net/download/prj/jsonxml/">json2xml</a> Javascript routine can be combined with a <a href="http://blog.pipes.yahoo.com/examples/example.01.html">Pipes AJAX feed</a> to generate XML text containing everything the Yahoo pipe has generated, RSS compliant or not.</li></ul><br />
It's easy enough to handcraft a map that combines OpenLearn Unit links with Wikipedia maps - but why is this interesting/useful? If I manage to produce a demo that feels even half-way right, I'll post it.</p>

<p>For now, here's a glimpse:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5079371946206514242"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rn2N35e5TEI/AAAAAAAAAHk/lUw2pi2QrsE/s800/openlearnwikipedia.png" /></a></p>

<p>This shows a combination of an OpenLearn Unit map and a Wikipedia/wikimindmap node (the exploded "computer virus" node). The green recycle symbols are a feature of the modified map viewer. Clicking on the symbol loads a new wikimindmap centred on the corresponding node.</p>

<h3 class="title">Re-Presentation and Re-Interpretation of OpenLearn XML Materials</h3>

<p>Thinking back over many of my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=openlearn&IncludeBlogs=1149">Openlearn doodles</a>, it would be hard to see many of the experiments as <em>remix</em> or <em>reuse</em> examples using any common understanding of those terms.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/get-started-learner/get-started-educator/competition.php">OpenLearn Competition</a> page, <em>reuse</em> and <em>remix</em> are defined as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Define: reuse<br />
Use our content as it is to impact learners. This could be through using it in your own teaching or by delivering our content in a new medium which engages more learners.<br />
Top marks will go for evidence of impact. You might use OpenLearn materials to reach a large number of users - perhaps through a social network you are part of or your own version of Moodle - or you might impact just one person but in a really critical way for their learning.</p>

<p>Define: remix<br />
Amend our materials to create something new. This could mean taking old archived materials and updating them by adding your own knowledge. It might mean localising our content for an audience with different cultural and language needs. Maybe you'll use our knowledge mapping software to demonstrate a new perspective on the materials. For example see the knowledge maps relating to our study units that add new resources and perspectives on the original material.</blockquote><br />
I've commented on my confusion about these terms before (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010112.html">So What Exactly Is An OpenLearn Content Remix?</a>) but here are a few more thoughts on the topic...</p>

<p>In most of the tinkering I've done with OpenLearn materials, <em>I've not really been interested in how teachers or learners might use what I've produced to deliver learning experiences OR in the content that is delivered</em>.</p>

<p>What does interest me are the ways I can <em>re-present</em> or <em>re-interpret</em> the materials. OpenLearn XML takes the place of LEGO bricks, and at the moment I'm just playing with it...</p>

<p>So here then are some preliminary thoughts on what <em>re-presentation</em> and <em>re-interpretation</em> might be to draw out this distinction:<br />
<ul><li><em>Re-presentation</em>: finding alternative ways to present and publish OpenLearn Content units, using OpenLearn XML (ideally) as the source material. Examples here include delivering content <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">via RSS feeds</a>, or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010436.html">via a wiki</a>. Experiments with navigational forms also fit here, maybe? For example, providing <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008189.html">hierarchical navigation sidebars</a> (and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009144.html">sensible addressing</a>) or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010439.html">dynamic (mind) maps</a>.</li><br />
<li><em>Re-interpretation</em>: by reinterpretation, I mean seeing the OpenLearn XML as something <em>other</em> than a 'traditional' course unit, such as using the course unit as a database that can be mined in various ways. For example, the "outlinks" from the unit can be used to define a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">custom search engine</a>, book references can be used to seed an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">OpenLearn Unit online bookshop</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">media assets can be stripped</a> to provide a topic specific multimedia channel. <em>Re-presented</em> content can also be used as the basis of re-interpretation. For example, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009164.html">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a> (as well as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009213.html">more general personally scheduled web feeds</a>) reinterpret the way in which content is delivered, in this case as daily chunks.</li></ul></p>

<p>In short, I guess <em>re-presentation</em> and <em>re-interpretation</em> - which is where my interests lay - represent a <em>re-imagining</em> of what OpenLearn XML might be transformed into in a technical sense...</p>

<p>...whereas <em>remix</em> and <em>reuse</em> are focussed more on the end-user and on how the "contentful" aspect of the materials can be used to deliver actual teaching and learning in association with other resources.</p>

<h3 class="title">Mapping OpenLearn XML, Pass 2</h3>

<p>Okay, so here's a second pass at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010438.html">mapping the links contained in an OpenLearn Unit</a>, partly in response to <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=40600">Stephen's general criticism</a> (which I totally agree with) about the misuse of mindmaps for simply "listing" things without any structure.</p>

<p>This time links are organised according to the section they are contained in: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/demo/openLearnLinkMapper2.html">Structured T180 links</a></p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5079061132308204594"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnxzMJe5TDI/AAAAAAAAAHU/BsQ73JFAakY/s800/openlearnlinkmap2.png" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the links are now rather hard to find (not each section contains external links).</p>

<p>I'm also a bit concerned about how quickly the map is starting to grow, even for quite a small unit.</p>

<p>Next pass is to add in a bit of text, maybe, or some of the media assets (if that's possible), just to see where all this exploration leads! ;-)</p>

<p>But now it's late and I need to go to bed...</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Unit Link Map</h3>

<p>My feedreader seemed to be full this morning with posts about <a href="http://www.wikimindmap.org/viewmap.php?wiki=en.wikipedia.org&topic=Open_educational_resources">wikimindmap</a>, which produces a mindmap view of Wikipedia content.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5078845825597656066"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnuvXpe5TAI/AAAAAAAAAG0/oqlGshPj3nc/s800/wikiMindMap.png" /></a></p>

<p>At first I thought this was doing something <em>really</em> clever, but a tiny bit of digging suggests they're just link scraping (and exploiting a bit of structure - like "See also" information) and then using a (really neat) third party tool - the <a href="http://fb.stikipad.com/fb/show/HomePage">Flash Browser for FreeMind mind maps</a> - to display the results:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5078845855662427154"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnuvZZe5TBI/AAAAAAAAAG8/OvCqv3e70_U/s800/wikipediaOER.png" /></a></p>

<p>One thing I will take away from the WikiMindMap, though, is the way it provides a really "gentle" navigational display for the links contained on a page (and one I may reuse in a <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> context).</p>

<p>After a quick "View Source", I just had to knock up a demo link viewer for the links in an OpenLearn Unit, slightly modifying the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">OpenLearn XML Unit link scraper</a> that I built some time ago.</p>

<p>Anyway - here's a demo of the links contained in T180_8: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/demo/openLearnLinkMapper.html">OpenLearn Unit link mapper demo</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5078845868547329058"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnuvaJe5TCI/AAAAAAAAAHE/XJjzIEXvFGM/s800/openlearnLinkMapDemo.png" /></a></p>

<p>Some basic <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/demo/openLearnMindMapper.xsl">link scraping XSL</a> generates a crude FreeMind XML file which is then passed to the flash FreeMind viewer.</p>

<p>If I get a chance over the weekend, I'll generalise the viewer and add it to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">Towards an OpenLearn XML (Re)Publishing System</a>, providing a map view to arbitrary OpenLearn Units (or at least the ones for which I have URL powered access to the XML...).</p>

<p>I also need to have a think about putting a bit of structure into the links view (maybe extracting links by section [UPDATE: demoed here - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010439.html">Mapping OpenLearn XML, Pass 2</a>], and maybe even trying to use something like the Yahoo content analyser to add a few relevant tags) and exploring how I might add media assets scraped from OpenLearn Units into the map view.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard: Filtered RSS Feed Display</h3>

<p>In response to a "user request" <a href="http://www.fredscapes.nl/2007/06/19.html#a1613">;-)</a> I added a couple of extra features to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard">OPML Dashboard</a>:<br />
<ul><li>(optional) limit on the number of items that are displayed in a the feed panels (the default is 4);</li><br />
<li>(optional) single word filter term applied to each feed. For example: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloglines.com%2Fexport%3Fid%3Dpsychemedia%26folder%3Dcorporate&filterterms=google&numFeedItems=&src=url&submit=Display+OPML">my "corporate" feedroll, filtered on "google"</a>.</li></ul></p>

<p>The filter was trivial to implement - if a search term is passed to the <em>opmlDisplaymanager</em> script, the feed that is loaded into each panel is actually a routed via a simple <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=8LTN1Jge3BGdW_SlJZhxuA">Yahoo filter pipe</a>. Only feed items that contain the filter term make it out of the pipe and as far as the feed display panel.</p>

<p>The pipe took all of five minutes to build an integrate and is good enough for proof of concept/rapid prototyping, methinks?</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Content via a Wiki</h3>

<p>When OpenLearn first launched, one of the things I fully expected the playful folk out there to do was to migrate the content into a wiki - <em>just because they could...</em>. As far as I can tell, this hasn't happened yet...</p>

<p>We're now several months in to the first phase of the OpenLearn project, and content migration of OU course units into the OpenLearn environment is carrying on apace. However, my reading of the (lack of) activity in <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a>, where the project team were hoping to see reversioned content uploads, is that: a) no-one is really sure what the license allows, and what sorts of things you could possibly do that constitute a <em>remix</em>; b) the process of getting content <em>out</em> of LabSpace, doing stuff to it, and then getting content <em>back in</em> to LabSpace is just too hard...</p>

<p>The OpenLearn team, too, are maybe having second thoughts about how they see the LabSpace working for content remix: <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/?p=93">Long live LabSpace or RIP?</a>.</p>

<p>So as I wait for the 'official' release of OpenLearn course content RSS feeds (due over the summer, I believe), I thought I'd take a break from my own <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=openlearn%20rss&IncludeBlogs=1149">RSS OpenLearn tinkerings</a> and have a play with wikifying OpenLearn content, just to see how it feels...</p>

<p>So last night I spent and hour or so cutting and pasting content from an OpenLearn unit - <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1544">Exploring distance time graphs (MU120_3)</a> - into a wiki: <a href="http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3">MU120_3 Wiki</a>... just to see: a) how it felt; and b) what immediate issues came to mind.</p>

<p>So here's the quickest of quick summary of points that first came to my mind:<br />
<ol><li>How should I style the content? <em>As simply as possible...</em></li><br />
<li>How should I map content from the course to the wiki? <em>Course page to wiki page.</em></li><br />
<li>How should I name pages on the wiki? <em>Sensibly, to give some chance of URL hacking working... I opted for OpenLearn unit page number to course page number. E.g. from a root "http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3" the n'th page would be "http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3<strong>_n</strong>".</em></li><br />
<li>How should navigation between pages be handled? <em>I opted for simplicity - previous/next links and a link back to the course contents page.</em></li><br />
<li>How should activities, images etc. be handled? <em>As simply as possibly, with easy to achieve style changes (boxes, bold font) where it was important to identify a particular sort of content (figure caption or description, for example, or activity disussion).</em></li></ol></p>

<p>Having cut'n'pasted a sample of material I asked the OpenLearn team how they felt about it. Deliberately,  I didn't put attribution or licensing detail up, in contravention of the license. This was noticed, and a member of the team rectified the situation by adding a licensing link to the top of the first page.</p>

<p>Looking over the wiki structure - I opted for <a href="http://pbwiki.com">pbwiki</a> - I noticed that within a pbwiki subdomain the editable sidebar appears on each wiki page. As such, this is an ideal place for a licensing/attribution statement. Once added, the attribution will now appear in the sidebar on each newly created wiki page. [Added: I also added a link in the sidebar back to the OpenLearn forum associated with the course, something I also tried to remember to do in the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a> feeds.]</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/openlearnWiki.png" alt="Openlearn wiki sidebar" /></p>

<p>One major issue that came to my mind was loss of tracking data if people consume the course material via the wiki rather than from the OpenLearn site. This can be mitigated by adding tracking to the wiki pages - so I added a Google analytics tracking code to the sidebar. If anyone uses the wiki, the usage becomes trackable (user edits to content will of course be tracked by the wiki itself).</p>

<p>As far as 'ease of use for remixing' goes, I know which I would prefer over making changes to the wiki or editing OpenLearn XML and resubmitting it...</p>

<p><em>Even as I was cutting and pasting content into the wiki</em>, I made a couple of additions to the material: firstly to add a (relevant) link to an online graph paper generator (on <a href="http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3_3">this page</a>) and secondly to add a (missing) description to an image.</p>

<p>Does this count as a remix, I wonder? If nothing else, it's a least a minor revision... One thing I do know for sure, I won't be submitting the changes - small as they are - back to the LabSpace via the OpenLearn XML (re)submission route.</p>

<p>And if I make <em>major</em> changes to the content, I won't be submitting it back to OpenLearn/LabSpace via that route either - the conversion into the XML format from the wikitext (or WYSIWYG) view would be just too time consuming...</p>

<p>So I guess the current - and any future - changes to this material are lost to OpenLearn?</p>

<p>Ho hum - if you want to tinker with the content, it's at <a href="http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3">http://openlearn.pbwiki.com/MU120_3</a>; at the moment an easy to guess password is required to get in to edit it, though anyone can see the content.</p>

<p>Mail me if you want to play and can't guess the (case sensitive...) password...</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard View: A Glanceable Display of Recent Social Bookmarks</h3>

<p>Having got the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010427.html">OPML Dashboard Display</a> prototype posted, I had a quick look around some of my previous OPML generating tools to see which ones would obviously benefit from a dashboard view. First up is the <em>Social Bookmarks Feed Roller</em>, which allows you to generate an OPML feed containing links to user-specified tagged feeds from some of the most  popular social bookmarking sites.</p>

<p>OUseful web page application: new, improved <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/sbfeedRoller.html">social bookmarks feed roller</a> ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5077924018241752050"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rnho_Ze5S_I/AAAAAAAAAGc/36dG-p2RPIs/s800/sbfeedroller.png" /></a></p>

<p>What this tool does is let you generate an online OPML file that points to a set of RSS feeds from one or more social bookmarking systems using one or more user names and tags.</p>

<p>For example, you can generate links to feeds from several different tags on you own social bookmarking account to provide you with a birds eye view of the latest links you have save to those particular tags (<em>use a single user name and several tags to generate the OPML</em>). Here's an example with half a dozen tags from my delicious account: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?src=url&id=http%3A%2F%2Fouseful.open.ac.uk%2FsbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%26tags%3Dopml%2Bmanager%2520web2.0%26services%3Ddelicioushttp%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%26tags%3Delearning%2520web2.0%2520design%2520video%2520audio%2520search%26services%3Ddelicious">single  user, multiple tags demo</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you a part of a group that is collecting resources using the same group tag on personal accounts across one or more social bookmarking sites, you can easily generate a feed that will provide you with an overview of the latest bookmarks from each individual (<em>use several user names and a single tag to generate the OPML</em>; note that at the current time, a link to the feed from <em>each</em> individual on <em>each</em> selected social bookmarking site will be generated).  Here's an example with the same tag from half a dozen delicious users (identified from my delicious network): <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/opmlDisplayManager.php?src=url&id=http%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php%3Fusrs%3Dpsychemedia%2520meisenstadt%2520nessman%2520jjn1%26tags%3Delearning%26services%3Ddelicious">multiple users, single tag demo (OPML Dashboard)</a>, <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&view=3p&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/sbFeeds2opml.php?usrs=psychemedia%20jjn1%20meisenstadt%20nessman&tags=elearning&services=delicious">multiple users, single tag demo (Grazr)</a>. </p>

<p>To create the current version of the app I tweaked the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006101.html">original Social Bookmarking OPML Feed Roller</a> app by adding a couple links of OPML feed display tool links. In particular, it's now possible to open an automatically generated online OPML feed for a particular profile directly into an <em>OPML Dashboard</em> display, as well as a <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr widget</a> view.</p>

<p>Once you have opened the dashboard display, you can of course bookmark the page and revisit it for live bookmark updates whenever you choose.</p>

<p>More complex OPML files an be created <em>on-page</em> by generating an OPML Roll from a set of selected profiles. In order to view this compound OPML feed, you will have to select the OPML code, save it to a file, and upload it to an OPML hosting site such as <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr.com</a>.</p>

<p>Try it out here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/sbfeedRoller.html">Social Bookmarking Service OPML Feed Roller</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find a link to the service from the main <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard">OPML Dashboard</a> homepage.</p>

<h3 class="title">Last.fm: in it for the ads...?</h3>

<p>My first day listening to <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> for a bit (no particular reason for being away from it, just one of those things), and the last few songs that have played have all been new/recent releases...</p>

<p>Hmmm... like maybe they're playing new stuff they want me to go and buy...?</p>

<p>The big search engines, and their commentators, often post a <em>weather report</em> when the ranking algorithms change, to let people know their position in the search engine organic listings may change.</p>

<p>As more and more sites get into social recommendation systems, mediated with a bit of secret sauce, voodoo algorithm magic, the ones that succeed will be the ones that perform for their users. That is, the ones with trusted algorithms.</p>

<p>When the algorithms change, so can the feeling of the site.</p>

<p>So I wonder, have things changed at last.fm, or is it just one of those playlist things...?</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Search Engine</h3>

<p>Idling with the OU search engine the other day, I thought I'd do a search for the simple term <em>blog</em> just to see what it turned up... Here's a link to the <a href="http://css2.open.ac.uk/search/search.aspx?chk=Other&chkd=chkCourses|chkProspectus|chkOpenLearn|chkOther|&qt=blog&st=1">actual search query</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_0.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>Hmm - how about the second results page?</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_1.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>Err...</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_2.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>"Oh, for goodness sake...!"</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_3.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_4.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>Now I have nothing against <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc">Marc's blog</a>, but for a "novice" searcher, this sort of results listing is, IMHO, completely unacceptable...</p>

<p>Although it's maybe handy for making a teaching point on our infoskills short course (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google</a>)?</p>

<p>In particular, here's how a  little bit of knowledge about search query construction helps matters -  simply add a <a href=""><em>-eisenblog</em></a> term to the search query to filter the results:</p>

<p><img src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogpics/ousearch_blog/ouSearch_5.png" alt="OU search engine" /></p>

<p>(Err, unless you are logged in to the OU intranet, of course, when the first two pages of results  point to <em>Search results - Elementaries - The Watson Blog</em>....!)</p>

<p>In fact, this teaches something even more powerful too - the idea of subtractive (excluding) filters applied incrementally to a set of search results to exclude items that contain a particular result, as opposed to only pasing resulkts that necessarily <em>include</em> a particular search term.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Dashboard Display</h3>

<p>Generalising the approach for an dashboard (webtop) style OPML display protoyped in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010416.html">OPML Powered Dashboard Prototype - sort of...</a> , and originally idled about in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010415.html">OPML Powered Dashboards</a>, I've popped up an <em>OPML Dashboard Display Manager</em> at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/"http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/opmldashboard/</a>.</p>

<p>The manager allows you to enter the URL of an OPML file (or public user details for popular OPML publishing/hosting sites)<br />
and the <em>OPML Dashboard</em> service will do the rest, displaying feeds that are pointed to from the OPML file in dashboard style:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5076009115662765026"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnGbZZe5S-I/AAAAAAAAAGM/NMivSRu6cHA/s800/opml2html.png" /></a></p>

<p>At the moment, folder structure in the OPML is completely ignored, so there's no way (at the current time) you can influence the grouping of the tabs, other than by changing the order of feeds in the OPML file: the OPML display manager scans left to right, adding panels in the order feeds are presented in the source OPML file.</p>

<p>Although the current OPML Dashboard Display Manager does not, as yet, really handle any OPML elements other than ones that point to RSS/Atom feeds, I have started experiment with various "intelligent" handlers for simple link items in the OPML file. First up is a handler for YouTube Playlists (using the tool developed in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010419.html">YouTube Playlist RSS Feeds With Video Enclosures (Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists Redux)</a>). If a link to a youTube playlist is present in an OPML file, this handler will display a Grazr widget that can play the movies contained in that playlist.</p>

<p>(A separate handler is also available to display a particular youTube movie, given the URL of its youTube page. At the moment, though, the styling used to display multiple playlists/movies is, err, completely missing...)</p>

<p>The styling of the panels is pretty much the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/documentation/reference.html">Google Feeds API default styling</a>. If anyone has suggestions for an improved style (or knows where to find a Google feeds API online style editor/scratchpad), please feel free to pass them along... :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">YouTube Playlist RSS Feeds With Video Enclosures  (Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists Redux)</h3>

<p>In what will (hopefully!) be the last post on this topic for a bit, here's a link to a Yahoo Pipe that will take in a YouTube Playlist URL, and produce an RSS feed of that playlist - with the appropriate movies attached as an enclosure to each item in the feed.</p>

<p><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg">YouTube Playlist Feed With Video Enclosures</a>.</p>

<p>What the attachment means is that you can <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9">view a YouTube playlist in a Grazr widget</a>, for example:</p>

<div style="height:400px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ijXS6T0Y3BGMaIzvjknRlg&amp;_render=rss&amp;_run=1&amp;youtubeplaylistURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3DCA23DDFA84A2ACC9"></script></div>

<p>This pipe supercedes the approach described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</a>, which took a snapshot of a playlist and generated the feed from an enumerated list of movie IDs that were explicitly captured within a fixed URL; the new pipe scrapes a <em>live</em> feed from the playlist using a <a href="http://www.dapper.net/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=youtubePlaylistscraper">youTube Playlist scraper Dapp</a>.</p>

<p>If generating the feed URL from the Yahoo Pipes page is too much for you, this <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml">youTube Playlist viewing Grazr widget</a> (here's a youTube Playlist URL to try it with: <em>http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=398D1C0A2DC0ED05</em>):</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/youtubePlaylist.opml"></script></div>

<p>Or if you'd rather watch a youTube movie playlist using a native Google gadget, check out this post:  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010394.html">Google Gadgets - RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, I now fully expect to see that youTube has opened up an API onto their playlists, making this stuff all redundant!</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Powered Dashboard Prototype - sort of...</h3>

<p>Picking up on the previous post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010415.html">OPML Powered Dashboards</a>, I couldn't resist seeing how easy it would be to build a demonstrator OPML powered dashboard using pre-existing components pulled off the web.</p>

<p>A quick search turned up an <a href="http://www.phpied.com/opml-to-html-via-javascript/">OPML2HTML Javascript routine</a>, which I complemented with this <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/importxml.html">XML import routine</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/">Google AJAX Feed API</a>. The feed API loads feeds into a page with a single line of code, via an RSS2JSON proxy (which gets around security issues), as well as offering display routines.</p>

<p>So here it is (only tested in Firefox...): <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/opmlDisplayTest2.html">minimal OPML powered dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5076009115662765026"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnGbZZe5S-I/AAAAAAAAAGM/NMivSRu6cHA/s800/opml2html.png" /></a></p>

<p>The feed displayed currently needs to reside on the local server in accordance with browser security policies. For the three column display to work properly, the OPML file must be of a particular form, in particular using the <em>column:left</em>, <em>column:middle</em>, <em>column:right</em> naming convention referred to in the previous post.</p>

<p>Other layout strategies are possible of course (e.g. just trundling through the OPML file and distributing the feed panels across each column).</p>

<p>At the moment, the only OPML elements that are recognised are the column outline elements and elements that point to RSS feeds. As mentioned in the previous post, it should also be easy enough to display straghtforward text/HTML in a simple text panel.</p>

<p>More of a challenge would be trying to handle GrazrScript... ;-)</p>

<p>All told, it took no longer than a couple of hours of tinkering to get the demo together, including finding the code resources and a basic 3 column CSS style. Sorting out the styling is the next challenge, and one I always have to battle with. Checking the code for cross-browser Javascript and CSS gripes is also required.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Powered Dashboards</h3>

<p>Since posting about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010382.html">OU Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</a>, I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about this sort of surface and how they could be used to both manage and display OPML feeds:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025135594261298"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBe5e5SzI/AAAAAAAAADo/D7zfqTImG94/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab1.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the first case - <em>OPML feed management</em> - feeds displayed on a dashboard tab could be made available via a derived OPML feed. (Netvibes allows you to <a href="http://blog.netvibes.com/?2005/10/08/7-opml-export">export your whole feed collection</a>, but not generate an OPML feed corresponding to the panels on a particular tab, I think?)</p>

<p>For example, here&#8217;s a an <a href="http://www.opmlmanager.com/outliner/ounews">OPML version of the OU News tab</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075873218602552274"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RnEfzJe5S9I/AAAAAAAAAF8/Bm4Xza_WapA/s800/ouNewsOPMLView.png" /></a></p>

<p>(Here&#8217;s the actual <a href="http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/ounews.opml">OPML feed</a>; and here&#8217;s one for the <a href="http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/outthere.opml">OUt There</a> tab.)</p>

<p>This code is derived (handcrafted) from the feed panels contained on the corresponding tab of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful Dashboard</a>. It would be nice to see this sort of OPML feed made available from each tab.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve actually grouped the feed links into folders that represent the columns on the PageFlakes page, to make explicit the intention being that surfaces like PageFlakes should also be able to <em>display</em> OPML files. Round-tripping could then be provided in two ways:</p>

<ol><li>An OPML file could be used to import a set of feed links into a tab. Pageflakes sort of offers this at the moment - an OPML file can be uploaded to a tab, wherein the OPMLd feed links are bookmarked and can then be placed on the tab as individual panels. I suggested to the PageFlakes chaps that as well as OPML file upload, import from an OPML URL should also be supported (as it is in <a href="http://www.opmlmanager.com">OPML Manager</a>, for example), so that may be on the cards some time soon? <img src='http://conclave.open.ac.uk/OUseful/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  By exporting as well as importing OPML, this also provides an <em>ad hoc</em> mechanism for grabbing a copy of a particular dashboard tab.</li>
<li>An OPML file could be used to feed a <em>live</em> set of feed URLs into a tab, turning the tab into an OPML reading list viewer. <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> already does this, of course, but it doesn&#8217;t offer the dashboard style view that PageFlakes and Netvibes do. Subscribing to an OPML feed could then populate a tab from the OPML feed contents. The feed linked to above shows how it&#8217;s also possible to add a small amount of structure (which column to put each feed panel into) to the feed, albeit in a clumsy, clunky way.
OPML feeds can also be used to define the contents of <em>several</em> tabs, as this (evolving) <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/dashboardDemo.opml">OUseful Dashboard OPML  feed (via Grazr)</a> demonstrates.</li></ol>

<div style="height:350px;width:500px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&view=3p&file=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/dashboardDemo.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&view=3p&file=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/dashboardDemo.opml"></script></div>

<p>At the moment, I have just used the OPML to transport feed URLs around, but OPML as currently defined also allows you to transport HTML around inside an OPML item. This would be ideal for populating a simple HTML note  panel, for example.</p>

<p>Being able to add <em>functional</em> items to a panel would also be possible by making use of something like <a href="http://docs.grazr.com/script/spec/1.0/">GrazrScript</a>. (For example, GrazrScript is used to define the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009224.html">OpenLearn search widget</a> that appears on the first OUseful Dashboard tab.</p>

<p>Now there&#8217;s a thought: PageFlakes and Grazr joining forces...</p>

<p>In the meantime, how hard could it be to generate a panelled display from an OPML feed using something like <a href="http://nexus.zteo.com/2006/12/31/create-your-own-webtop-in-phpjs-in-no-time/">Chris Ravensroft&#8217;s "Create your own WebTop in php/js in no time" approach</a>? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">So Just What is a Podcast (or a Blog)...?</h3>

<p>JISC are running an online conference at the moment - <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/elp_conference07">Innovating e-Learning 2007: Institutional Transformation and Supporting Lifelong Learning</a> (where there are some interesting discussions going on - check it out if you can...)</p>

<p>Today's keynote is delivered via "a podcast", with a transcript also available:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075463886744406978"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm-rg5e5S8I/AAAAAAAAAFs/g7gi2SXOj2I/s800/notAPodcast.png" /></a></p>

<p>Hmmm.... <em>podcast</em>...?</p>

<p>Looking at the above screenshot, the implied definition of "podcast" can only be something along the lines of "audio embedded in a web page playable via an embedded audio player".</p>

<p>(And not even a very good audio player at that. You have no idea where you are in the audio file, how long it lasts, no freedom to select a point 3 minutes and 27 seconds in etc.)</p>

<p>Whenever I hear the word <em>podcast</em> (just like whenever I hear the word <em>blog</em>) I <em>assume</em> a couple of things:</p>

<p>- that content is regularly published from that site;<br />
- that I can subscribe to that content via an RSS/Atom feed.</p>

<p>In the case of podcasts, this feed can be used to syndicate content to my feed reader, or as a way of providing subscription based downloads to a client I synch with my MP3 player.</p>

<p>For a one off event like a conference, I'd probably even relax the "regularly published" constraint, and just go with the "made available via RSS" requirement.</p>

<p>The JISC online conference keynote "podcast" doesn't offer a feed - indeed, it doesn't offer the typical user <em>any</em> way of downloading an MP3 file of the audio. Not that you'd necessarily want to, in this context.</p>

<p>(Andy Powell also <a href="http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/06/jisc_online_con.html">muttered about the discussion threading</a>...)</p>

<p>I (and others) noticed something similar (in respect of language (mis)use) at the OU CTSS conference a couple of months ago, though that time with respect to the word <em>blog</em>. In particular, it seemed as if the word was being used to mean "web page that I published without support", though some speakers did go so far as to mean "a web page where someone in authority will make very occasional posts, asking you, dear reader, a question, and then you can comment on the post."</p>

<p>But that was about it... <em>Subscription</em> didn't figure... Maybe that's because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Wikipedia entry for blog</a> doesn't mention subscription, or syndication, or RSS, although it does highlight the "ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format [as] an important part of many blogs."</p>

<p>(Wikipedia does seem to expect feed based subscription for podcasts, though, although not a requirement for in-page embedded audio players...: "A podcast is a digital media file, or a series of such files, that is distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and personal computers." [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">Wikipedia: podcast</a>])</p>

<p>For me, subscription is a defining characteristic of the sorts of publishing I think of as blogs'n'podcasts (though maybe I need to rethink in light of received wisdom as exemplified by Wikipedia? Or maybe I should go in and propose a change to the Wikipedia definition...?). What subscription means to me is that even though I can keep getting content updates from the blog or podcast, <em>I never have to visit the site again...</em></p>

<p>In the sense of syndication, it also means I can choose <em>where</em> I consume the content: a Bloglines or Google Reader river of news client, a PageFlakes or Netvibes dashboard (like my demo <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010382.html">Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</a>), via my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007429.html">customised Moodle sidebar</a> (or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009239.html">here</a>), etc.</p>

<p>Blogs as reflective journals seems to be the way the term is used (in the OU at least) for student based activity. Blogs as places where a position can be stated and readers can comment on it (e.g. as a consultation tool, maybe?) seems to be the way blogs are interpreted here for internal administrative use. Blogs as publishing vehicles that support feed based subscription and syndication doesn't seem to be widely recognised, as yet...</p>

<h3 class="title">GeoRSS from delicious Geo-tags via a Yahoo pipe</h3>

<p>Although there are now several ways to create geo-tagged feeds using map based interfaces - for example using <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/map-making-so-easy-caveman-could-do-it.html">Google Mymaps</a> - there may still be occasions when you want to get geo-tagged resources from social bookmarking systems such as delicious (err, maybe...?! ;-)</p>

<p>So here's a Yahoo Pipe that will do just that. It looks for tags of the form <em>geo:lat=</em> and <em>geo:long=</em> in a delicious feed and if it finds them it augments the feed item with corresponding <em>&lt;geo:lat&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;geo:long&gt;</em> tags:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075248365285493682"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm7nf5e5S7I/AAAAAAAAAFg/dT2EU8QoGDU/s800/deligeotag.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the pipe: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?urlinput1=del.icio.us%2Fpsychemedia%2Fou&_id=OujaT7cY3BG1RcJjyjUFzw">delicious geoRSS annotation pipe</a></p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075246574284131234"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm7l3pe5S6I/AAAAAAAAAFU/EX0xljABt2Q/s800/deligeoRSS.png" /></a></p>

<p>And for example, here's a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Fpipes.yahoo.com%2Fpipes%2Fpipe.run%3F_id%3DOujaT7cY3BG1RcJjyjUFzw%26_render%3Drss%26_run%3D1%26urlinput1%3Ddel.icio.us%252Fpsychemedia%252Fou&ie=UTF8&z=9&om=1">demo feed plotted on a Google Map</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Simile Exhibit Library Catalogue Browser?</h3>

<p>Just a quickie - I've just had a look at this post on <a href="http://www.semanticblogging.org/semblog/blog/default/?permalink=D6D0E3701EE05BBB4085CB338D27D354.html">Fun with SIMILE Exhibit</a>, which takes a BibTex bibliography file and displays it as a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/exhibit/">Simile Exhibit</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the result: a <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Steve_Cayzer/publications2.htm">semantically browsable publications page</a>. Go check it out...</p>

<p>Why's this interesting? Well, it strikes me that the Simile Exhibit code could be used to provide a client for the BibTex data (or the JSON formatted data that Simile actually feeds off)... so how about if a search on a library catalogue was to expose the results via BibTex, and a Simile Exhibit client was then used to provide the user interface/display?</p>

<h3 class="title">Embedded Media Autodiscovery</h3>

<p>Thinking about the approach I'm using in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010401.html">delicious Feed Enhancer - Auto-Enclosures</a> - using web page URLs to generate the URL for media items embedded in  - or linked to from - a page, it strikes me that one way of opening up the page so that it reveals the media items embedded in it would be to use some form of media autodiscovery.</p>

<p>This could work in much the same way as <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery">(RSS) feed autodiscovery</a>. That is, a link tag is added to the head of an HTML document that points to the embedded media resource/linked to media resource/associated feed.</p>

<p>An enclosure tag for web pages, in other words...</p>

<p>As well as making it easy to scrape significant embedded media elements from a page, this approach could also be used to help browsers identify and opportunistically prefetch large media items associated with a particular webpage?</p>

<h3 class="title">delicious Feed Enhancer - Auto-Enclosures</h3>

<p>One of the nifty things about the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> feed processing widget is that it scans RSS feeds for media enclosures and embeds an appropriate player in the widget, wherever possible:</p>

<div style="height:400px;width:450px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&_render=rss" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&amp;_render=rss"></script></div>

<p>For example, if a Flash movie (<em>.swf</em> file) or audio file (<em>.mp3</em> or <em>.ram</em> (Real Audio)) are available as feed item enclosures, the Grazr widget will embed an appropriate video or audio flash player (see the above Grazr widget for a demo).</p>

<p>What this means is that <em>if</em> you can easily generate a feed with enclosures, you can easily create a multimedia channel.</p>

<p>This is exactly what <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> does: it provides an environment in which you can create multimedia playlists that feed a really nifty player widget (here's an example of a crude <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009963.html">Splashcast learning channel demo</a>). Splashcast can also scrape the content s of an RSS feed in search of media assets, and will provide a player for those, although I don't think it (yet) acts as a player for media enclosures (which I'd suggest is something of an oversight...)</p>

<p>However, the approach suggested here is to use a Yahoo pipe to <em>automatically</em> augment an RSS feed from the delicious social bookmarking tool with appropriate media file enclosures.</p>

<p>That is, users should be able to bookmark pages that may themselves contain embedded media resources, and then the pipe should be able to generate an enclosure link to the embedded resource from the bookmarked URL.</p>

<p>The reason why you'd want to bookmark the page containing the media resource rather than the resource itself is because the link to the resource is not necessarily very useful and is not the thing users are likely to naturally bookmark...</p>

<p>This allows you to create a social bookmarking RSS feed to act as the source of the media channel programme information, and then use Grazr to automatically embed an appropriate player for the media enclosures:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA">deliEnclosures</a> - augment an RSS feed from delicious with media enclosures.</blockquote>

<p>In particular, the pipe will augment bookmarked links from delicious with the following media enclosures:</p>

<p>- bookmarked mp3 files with an MP3 file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked ram (real audio) files with an ram file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked swf (Flash) files with a swf file enclosure;<br />
- bookmarked youTube movie web pages with a swf video file enclosure.<br />
- bookmarked show pages from <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> with an MP3 audio file enclosure for that show.</p>

<p>The example Grazr player referred to above (available <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=pt9RkEcY3BG1VsdyJphxuA&_render=rss">here</a>) is "playing" a pipe augmented feed from <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl">del.icio.us/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl</a>. (The pipe also works if you link straight to the RSS feed: <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl">http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/demo:feedEncl</a>.)</p>

<p>At the moment, the pipe is set up to consume a list of links from delicious. With only a slight modification to the top of the pipe, it could be used to augment <em>any</em> feed when provided with its URL and so provide a general purpose feed augmentation pipe.</p>

<p>The pipe is also easily extensible in the sense that if media resource URLs can be easily derived from bookmarked page URLs (as in the case of youTube movies, for example), the pipe can be extended to process these URLs and add an appropriate media enclosure.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5075080715532061586"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm5PBZe5S5I/AAAAAAAAAFA/Eo1mZ0ZhATg/s800/feedMediaEncl.png" /></a></p>

<p><s>(Not showing IT conversations augmentation...)</s></p>

<p>Here, the pipe filters the feed on items that can be augmented with media enclosures, and then processes items that can be directly augmented with an enclosure pointing straight to the bookmarked resource by simply copying the bookmarked URLs (like bookmarked links to MP3 files) straight to the enclosure. The next stage performs more complex mappings, in this case rewriting bookmarked youTube movie pages to the appropriate youTube movie file URL.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a> is not so well behaved in the way it formulates the URLs for the Flash movie associated with uploaded slideshows - an effectively arbitrary number is appended to file information contained within the URL of bookmarkable pages associated with each SlideShow. For example, the slideshow at <em>http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/social-bookmarking-sort-of/</em> is published via the Flash movie at <em>https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?doc=social-bookmarking-sort-of-12110</em>. The identifier <em>12110</em> is effectively unique, and can only be identified by scraping the resource web page.</p>

<p>If you know of other media sites - like youTube - that afford a mapping from a usefully bookmarkable(?) URL to a media resource URL. let me know and I'l add them to the pipe...</p>

<h3 class="title">ICT Resource Digger - fOUndit</h3>

<p>Not of my doing, but totally in keeping with the OUseful philosophy, <a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/">John Woodthorpe</a> has just opened up <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk">fOUndit</a>, a Digg like environment being tested as a resource discovery, social recommendation and current awareness tool to support OU ICT courses.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5074762093383207778"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm0tPJe5S2I/AAAAAAAAAEU/hQKHnZAsXmI/s800/foundit.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p><em>Social news</em> sites like this allow readers to submit and vote on news stories of interest to community members - in the case of fOUndit, the initial audience is the "T175 community" (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t175">T175</a> being an OU course on <em>Networked living: exploring information and communication technologies</em>; you can get a taste of the course here: <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/search.php?search=T175">T175 on OpenLearn</a>).</p>

<p>The service - which runs on the <a href="http://www.pligg.com/">Pligg</a> Digg clone  (<a href="http://www.pligg.com/blog">Pligg blog</a>) - has actually been in testing for a few weeks now (<a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/wordpress/?s=pligg">John's posts on OU Pligg</a>.</p>

<p>With services like <a href="http://www.corank.com/">coRank</a> offering hosted social news sites (so you can get something like your own Digg/Pligg without having to install anything on a server) it's now easy enough to set up and run your own site. The question then, of course, is building a community around it.</p>

<p>Anyway - it'll be interesting to see how <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk">fOUndit</a> takes off... there are several ways it could go I think:</p>

<p>- current awareness for course team and ALs (providing links of interest that may be worth mentioning to students);<br />
- as a student info sharing site - something like <a href="">Social ROUTES</a>;<br />
- as a 'keeping current' site for course alumni - keeping them in touch/up-to-date with the area <em>after</em> the end of the course (after all, all it takes is a subscription to the <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk/Pligg/rss.php">fOUndit RSS feed</a>);<br />
- as a "course issues" site for <em>potential</em> students.</p>

<p>Now I wonder, how could a course or programme social news site be designed to satisfy all those target groups, along with providing course tasters on OpenLearn for potential students and (authentication protected) access to live course info for current students and staff. </p>

<p>One of the things I've thought for a long time is that we should be upping the prominence of "current awareness", ,em>optional</em> wider reading on course related issues and so on... (I know, I know, if it's optional why would students read it... BECAUSE it provides current context for the stuff being studied, that's why...! ;-) Placing a feed from fOUndit on the course front page, cf. the feed I have taken from delicious on the T184 website, would be one way of making foundit content available to current students and ALs.<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5074776159401102194"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm06B5e5S3I/AAAAAAAAAEk/IuWm-lJ5e9Q/s800/t184frontpage.png" /></a></p>

<p>PS I keep on wondering too whether the social recommendation approach can be used for live informal learning production, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007457.html">OpenLearnigg</a> style... ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Gadgets - RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player</h3>

<p>Some time ago, I posted a bookmarklet that created a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">YouTube Playlist RSS feed</a> by scraping a playlist page and calling a feed generating service with the IDs for the movies in that playlist.</p>

<p>Although YouTube provides RSS feeds for many services, playlists is not (currently) one of them. For example feeds by user, tag, most recently viewed, most favourited and so on (see the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/rssls">full list of YouTube RSS feeds/feed URL patterns</a>).</p>

<p>One problem with the bookmarklet approach was that a static feed was created for movies listed on the playlist at the time the feed was created. If the playlist changed, the changes would not be propagated to the feed.</p>

<p>So here's a temporary stopgap - a minimal, Dapper created <a href="http://www.dapper.net/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=youtubePlaylistscraper">YouTube Playlist RSS feed</a>. Given a YouTube playlist ID, the Dapp scrapes the actual YouTube playlist page and generates a feed. The link element in each feed item points to the YouTube page for each movie described in the playlist.</p>

<p>The Dapp actually creates a feed with an additional empty link on the end (bad scraping design on my part). Rather than tidy the feed in the Dapp, I thought I'd create a Yahoo! Pipe that would clean the Dapp feed and only pass on links that genuinely referred to a YouTube movie page: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg">clean YouTube playlist feed pipe</a>.</p>

<p>Having generated this feed, I thought I should provide a player for it. The feed items don't contain enough information to power a <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a> channel - each feed item is limited to a title and a link at the current time - so I thought I'd try to find a way of wiring the feed into  another widget platform, in this case Google Gadgets.</p>

<p>For inspiration (i.e. code I could reuse ;-), I had a look at the Google create your own  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/gmcreator?moduleurl=gm_youtube.xml">YouTube Channel gadget</a> and a simple RSS viewing gadget (I've lost the reference for this at the mo :-(.</p>

<p>(To simplify the internals of the gadget, which actually feeds off the tidied Yahoo pipes filtered version of the scraped Youtube playlist feed, I use a good old fashioned URL rewrite, which takes URLs of the form <em>http://searchfeedr.com/youTubePlaylistFeed/FEEDURL</em> and rewrites them to the Yahoo pipe URL, which has the form <em>http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=TEM_6l0Q3BG6fZjojknRlg&_render=rss&_run=1&textinput1=FEEDURL</em>.)</p>

<p>Here's the result: a <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?root=%2Fig&dpos=top&num=24&url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player gadget for iGoogle</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?synd=open&num=24&url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google RSS Feed Powered YouTube Playlist Player gadget for your webpage</a> . (If you want the code, you can find it here: <a href="http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml">Google Gadget - Youtube Playlist video player code</a>.)</p>

<p><script src="http://gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml&amp;up_mtitle=youTube%20Playlist%20Player&amp;up_mfeed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fview_play_list%3Fp%3D398D1C0A2DC0ED05&amp;synd=open&amp;w=320&amp;h=290&amp;title=YouTube+Playlist+Player&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;output=js"></script></p>

<p>This gadget can be added to your <a href="http://google.com/ig">Google iGoogle Personal page</a>, or embedded in your own blog or social network personal page, in the normal way. <a href="http://fusion.google.com/ig/add?synd=open&source=ggyp&moduleurl=http://www.searchfeedr.com/gadgets/youTubePlaylistGadget.xml" ><img src="http://gmodules.com/ig/images/plus_google.gif" style="border:0" alt="Add Google Youtube playlist player gadget" /></a></p>

<p>By default, the gadget is subscribed to a demo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=398D1C0A2DC0ED05">OUseful Media Futures YouTube Video Playlist</a>.</p>

<p>[UPDATE: if you don't want to use a Google Gadget, here's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010419.html">live youTube playlist feed video playing Grazr widget</a>]</p>

<p>To customise the gadget to use a YouTube playlist of your own (or your own choosing), simply go to the gadget customisation panel and paste in the URL of the YouTube playlist page you want to subscribe to:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073653261676399426"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rmk8wpe5S0I/AAAAAAAAAD4/cZ-PnjhtdVM/s800/youtubeGadgetConfig.png" style="border:0" /></a> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073654069130251090"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rmk9fpe5S1I/AAAAAAAAAEE/-eqBA-DfTFM/s800/youtubeGadgetHtmlConfig.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In retrospect, a far more efficient way of creating the gadget would be to simply use the gadget to scrape the YouTube playlist page directly rather than letting Dapp do this. I shouldn't really be using the extra URL rewrite step either, but it's a trick that can help speed up prototyping, so in that sense it's worth recording here. The gadget based scraper on my to do list, by the way, but way down there at the moment. (If you beat me to it, please post me a link. ;-)</p>

<p>Rather more pressing is the need to improve the gadget interface a little. What I have in mind is displaying a list of movie titles as the initial gadget view (simply reusing the simple feed gadget code). An additional <em>Menu</em> control item between the <em>Next</em> and <em>Previous</em> controls would link back to this list. Clicking on any menu item would play the corresponding movie in the gadget.</p>

<p>As to why would I want to access playlist feed? Partly because it provides an easy way of allowing users to programme an embedded YouTube player from a personally managed control panel, thus getting round the problem of subscribing a tag based feed that is open to spam attacks via the tags (that is, third parties injecting content into the tag feed by tagging movies in that way).</p>

<h3 class="title">An Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</h3>

<p>In the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010376.html">previous post</a>, I described a Pageflakes tab that publishes feeds from a variety of OU bloggers who blog about OU related matters. This page is one of a set of shared Pageflakes tabs I popped up some time ago as a pain-free redesign of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a>*. It strikes me these tabs actually represent a basic, example pattern for an institutional information/news dashboard, so here's a brief explanation of how the page was put together.</p>

<p>Firstly - let's look at the setup. I'm actually sharing four tabs: <em>OUseful</em>, <em>OUt There</em>, <em>OU in the News</em> and the aforementioned <em>OU Bloggers</em>. Each of these tabs displays several panels that contain links to web content, including news stories, blog posts, OU press releases and calendar items.</p>

<p>Each panel is loaded <em>live</em> whenever you load the page. This means that when you visit the page, you'll be presented with <em>current</em> (most recent) content, updated automatically on your behalf.</p>

<p>By scanning just these four tabs, you can quickly review live content from thirteen blogs, four saved news searches, four saved social media searches, three institutional news feeds and a calendar feed; that's the equivalent of visiting twenty five different webpages from almost twenty websites in one go...</p>

<p><strong>OUseful</strong> <em>ego page</em></p>

<p>The <em>first</em> tab (<em>OUseful</em>) is largely a personal (ego) page, although it also relays events from the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful calendar</a>, in which I collect dates of OU talks and events likely to be of interest to OUseful.info readers.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025135594261298"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBe5e5SzI/AAAAAAAAADo/D7zfqTImG94/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab1.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column is an "About" tab that contains links to the 'major' OUseful properties. (I really do need to add some "About" information to this tab!). The <em>Interesting Links</em> are piped in from delicious. Most social bookmarking sites provide feeds for resources tagged by a particular use in a particular way, which means you can run several separate bookmarking panels - each with their own flavour of content - from a single social bookmarking account. (Of course, you can also create panels that display feeds from other people's social bookmark accounts).. There is also a Grazr widget that embeds a search over OpenLearn materials - search results appear in the widget itself (fed from an RSS feed obtained by scraping the OU search engine resutls page with Dapper).</p>

<p>In the centre column is a list of links to the major OUseful sites (again...hmmm - I really need to fix that "About" tab...), a list of the presentations I have uploaded to Slideshare, and a list of my H2O playlists. As and when I start uploading to content to Scribd, I'll probably add a tab of uploaded/shared documents to this column too. </p>

<p>In the right hand column is a feed from my blog, <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a>. The calendar panel takes in a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar/">feed from the OUseful calendar</a>, which is actually a public Google Calendar showing upcoming events likely to be of interest to internal <em>OUseful.info</em> readers.. If you run a Google Calendar, it's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=37648">easy enough to find the feed</a>.</p>

<p>Although this first tab is largely feeding ego-related content, the blend of resources does represent a pattern of a sort: <em>About</em> info; a selection of OUseful links and favourite links; links to my uploaded, shared content; 'informal' or 'grass roots' news from my <em>blog</em> feed (in the general case, this could be an aggregated feed from OU bloggers, a feed from the OU Facebook network, for example); and a <em>calendar/events</em> feed.</p>

<p><strong>OUt There</strong> News Feeds<br />
 <br />
The <em>second tab</em> (<em>OUt There</em>) contains panels fed by public OU feeds. The aim of this tab is to provide a quick scan of information that the OU is syndicating for public consumption:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025127004326690"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBeZe5SyI/AAAAAAAAADg/JFnKaoz6xAA/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab2.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column is a feed from Sesame, the OU community newspaper. This feed provides headline stories from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/">Sesame</a> website.</p>

<p>In the centre column is a panel that displays headlines from the latest <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/">OU press releases</a>. </p>

<p>In the right hand column is a feed of recent job vacancies. One thing I was considering was to filter the jobs feed (probably using a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipe</a>) so that it only passed jobs likely to be of interest to OUseful readers (e.g. jobs in AACS, the Library, LTS, KMi, as well as wider posts relating to elearning, search, and so on). At the moment, though, the jobs feed is just taken directly from the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/employment">OU recruitment website</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> web team are currently experimenting with BBC/OU broadcast schedule feeds, and as soon as these are officially published I'll pass them through to a panel on the <em>OUt There</em> tab.</p>

<p><strong>OU in the News</strong></p>

<p>The <em>third</em> tab (<em>OU in the News</em>) relays headlines from a variety of news search engines, as well as a blog search and some other social media site searches. The idea behind this tab is to provide an overview of news stories and blogosphere stories relating to the OU. At the moment, all the searches use the same search query term, the phrase <em>"Open University</em> (or, where a tag is required, the tag <em>openuniversity</em>): </p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025118414392082"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBd5e5SxI/AAAAAAAAADY/lN9gHXMj3o8/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab3.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column, the tab displays the top news stories in the UK as returned by Google news (this query uses the <em>location:uk</em> search limit). The panel displays a large number of results under the assumption that OU news stories are most likely to be reported by UK local and national media. On the to do list is a mapped representation of this feed (in which stories would be plotted at appropriate locations on a Google map).</p>

<p>In the centre column are searches on the Google, Yahoo and Microsoft Live news sites. As no search limits are applied to these searches, results will, therefore, include international news stories.</p>

<p>In the right hand column are several searches over social media: a search over YouTube movies where the OU is mentioned (this is actually a domain limited search using Live search, although a tag based feed retrieval might also be appropriate?); a search over blogs using Google blogsearch (I should perhaps also add in a Technorati search here?); and two tag based feeds pulled in from delicious - one on popular links tagged "openuniversity", and the other the most recent links with that tag.</p>

<p>Arguably, I could set up panels for (ar another tab for) "standard web search" searches, to provide an at a glance view of what users searching for "open university" on the Google, Yahoo or Microsoft search properties would see if they made that search. However, unlike the news search, these links are unlikely to change much each time you visit the page.</p>

<p><strong>OU Bloggers</strong></p>

<p>The <em>fourth</em> tab (<em>OU Bloggers</em>) contains feeds from OU bloggers who blog about OU matters in their blogs:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5072857524495534850"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmZpCpe5SwI/AAAAAAAAADI/cc3hlWzm-HI/s800/pageflakesOUbloggers.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>The left and middle columns are dominated at the top by personal blogs - the panels at the bottom of those columns have more of a flavour of "project related" blogs.</p>

<p>In the right hand column are several blogs that are dominated by posts relating to OpenLearn matters.</p>

<p>If the number of OU blogs increases, then it may be appropriate to spread the panels in this tab over several tabs, covering personal, project/work area, course and OpenLearn related topics, perhaps?</p>

<p><em>How it Works</em></p>

<p>Most of the tabs display content fed live in to the page via RSS feeds, demonstrating that <a href"http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>. There are only two exceptions, both on the first OUseful tab, that actually use static 'note' panels containing fixed, pre-specified links. The feeds are provided natively by the originating services (except the OpenLearn search) although the YouTube feed had to be finessed using a domain specific search from Microsoft Live search.</p>

<p>Feeds can be added individually to the original Pageflakes page, or in bulk via an OPML file. [Added: I actually pulled in the blog feeds via the OPML file from my "OU Bloggers" folder on Bloglines, using this trick: <a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/17/grazr-and-bloglines/">using Bloglines as an OPML manager</a>.] I will try to post an OPML generator that creates feed bundles along the lines of the patterns described above in the next week or two.</p>

<p>If you want to set up your own Pageflakes page, it's very easy to do: simply register at <a href="http://pageflakes.com">pageflakes.com</a> and then click on the likely looking links! To add RSS feeds, go to the web pages whose content you'd like to view via Pageflakes and look for the orange RSS feed icons: copy the URLs these link to and then add the URLs to the Pageflakes page via the "Add Feed" option.</p>

<p>It takes 20-30 minutes to put to series of tabs like the ones displayed on <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> together. As well as Pageflakes, there are other services that offer similar functionality - and that work in exactly the same way -  most notably <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personal Pages/iGoogle</a> and <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>. If anyone would like a demo, either for a one-to-one, seminar or workshop format, feel free to get in touch.</p>

<p><em>* To preserve the <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> URL in the browser address bar on the OUseful homepage, I use the page <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/index.html</em> which contains a frame into which I load the shared Pageflakes page.</em></p>

<p><tt>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;OUseful Homepage&lt;/title>&lt;/head&gt;<br />

<h3 class="title">OU Bloggers - At a Glance</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I was part of a DigiLab session on HE institutional blogging. Martin gave a good presentation on <em>why</em> people should be blogging (<a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/17/grazr-and-bloglines/">ThOU Shalt Blog</a>; the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mweller/th-ou-shalt-blog/">presentation</a> <s>should be</s> is on Slideshare <s>anytime</s>):</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=61253&doc=th-ou-shalt-blog1291" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=61253&doc=th-ou-shalt-blog1291" /></object></p>

<p>I rambled about some of the technology around blogs:</p>

<p>- <em>readers</em>: <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>;<br />
- <em>blog publishing/editors</em>: <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>(<a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> was mentioned too);<br />
- <em>productivity tools</em>: <a href="http://scribefire.com">Scribefire</a>;<br />
- <em>ranking/linking</em>: <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a>;<br />
- <em>syndication/stats</em>: <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>;<br />
- <em>comment tracking</em>: <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">CoComment</a>;<br />
- <em>tagcloud navigation</em>: <a href="http://zoomclouds.egrupos.net/">Zoomclouds</a>.</p>

<p>Mulling over how we could promote 'access' to people blogging about <em>OU issues</em>, I thought I'd add a tab to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful Pageflakes site</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5072857524495534850"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmZpCpe5SwI/AAAAAAAAADI/cc3hlWzm-HI/s800/pageflakesOUbloggers.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>Just go to the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful dashboard</a>, select the <em>OU Bloggers</em> tab and you'll get an overview of blogs from people who blog regularly on OU related issues.</p>

<p>(If you think your blog should be on that page too, mail me... :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">T151 Day One...</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago, I took on what should be a new production course if it gets through the opportunity review - T151 for those of you who speak <em>OU course code</em>, working title along the lines of <em>Digital Worlds: Interactive Media and Computer Game Design</em> (but don't quote me on that).</p>

<p>Production-wise, one of the approaches I'd like to explore, at least over the next three months, (which leaves plenty of time to rescue the course if things aren't working!) is a model that builds the course in part around third party content in several different ways.</p>

<p>In particular, I'd like to try and work out ways of using content that has different "durability" over possibly several years of course presentation. In this respect, I have in mind three classes of content: 'static', 'live' and 'transient'.</p>

<p>Here's how I see that working:</p>

<p>- <em>static</em> content is fixed for the life of the course (or at least, more than one presentation of the course): essays, papers, book references, major software resources and such like;</p>

<p>- <em>live</em> content on the other hand is content that is pulled in to the course on a live basis; this might be a live blog feed from a trusted source, for example, or links from a 'live' social bookmarking feed;</p>

<p>- somewhere in between is <em>transient</em> content. I see this as being content that is easily refreshed <em>between</em> presentations. This might even include content generated by students in a previous presentation, and then polished, or worked up, by the Course Team if necessary. Examples here include games created by students on previous courses, for example. Transient content will be fixed for the duration of presentation, but designed/identified as requiring maintenance/support <em>between</em> presentations.</p>

<p>We're having a CT meeting about the course later this week. As and when appropriate, I'll try and blog at the various stages we go through during course production.</p>

<p>(James Aczel is also blogging the progress of a course in development: <a href="http://h809.blogspot.com/2006/11/whats-this-blog-about_07.html">H809 Blog</a>.)</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Remix Competition</h3>

<blockquote><strong>Reuse or remix units - and win a prize!</strong>

<p>We're setting a challenge to educators worldwide to reuse and remix OpenLearn study materials. The aim is to inspire creativity, collaboration and cost reduction in course production, enabling wider access to education for all. We've launched a competition with two categories - reuse and remix. The competition aims to showcase and reward some of the best examples of this. And it is open to OU staff too!</p>

<p>So what are we looking for? And what exactly is reuse and remix? Reuse is about using our content as it is to have an impact on learners. This could be through using it in your own teaching or by delivering our content in a new medium which engages more learners.</p>

<p>Top marks will go for evidence of impact. You might use OpenLearn materials to reach a large number of users - perhaps through a social network you are part of or your own version of Moodle - or you might impact just one person but in a really critical way for their learning.</p>

<p>Remixing is about amending our OpenLearn materials to create something new. This could mean taking old archived materials and updating them by adding your own knowledge. It might mean localising our content for an audience with different cultural and language needs. Maybe you'll use our knowledge mapping software to demonstrate a new perspective on the materials. We are already sharing learning materials in XML and Moodle format and will soon be adding plain zip, IMS Content Package, html (through the "print this unit" facility) and RSS, so there are many different ways you can take our content and rework it. You might prefer to take our video or audio content and rework that.</p>

<p>There are two prizes - one for the best example of reuse and one for the best example of remix. The entry will be judged by a panel of open content experts. The winners will each receive:</p>

<p>- Some technology of their choice up to the value of 250 that will help them experiment with new methods of teaching. It can be something worthy or something fun: an iPod, a smartphone or some useful software.<br />
- Lots of attention at the OpenLearn conference 2007, where the winning entry will be showcased to experts in the field of open content.<br />
- Recognition in an OpenLearn press release.<br />
- Digital and printed stickers which can be used to announce their winning status to the world (better than an iPod any day).</p>

<p>To enter, email us at openlearn@open.ac.uk with 100-200 words telling us about your entry and why you think it deserves to win an OpenLearn award. State which category you are entering. Include a url or attachment to show your work in action if applicable and give some indication of impact or potential impact.</p>

<p>Remember to include your contact details. The competition is open to all - including Open University staff and students - with the exception of the panel of judges. The deadline is 1st October 2007. The winners will be announced at the OpenLearn 2007 conference on October 30th.</blockquote></p>

<h3 class="title">Personal Learning Environments are also Social...</h3>

<p>Whenever I do a social bookmarking workshop, one of the first things I stress is the <em>social</em> bookmarking tools are - first and foremost - <em>personally</em> useful: they are provide an excellent way of managing your own link collections without being locked to your favourites/bookmark list on a particular browser on a particular computer (though if <a href="http://www.zinkmo.com/">Zinkmo</a> does what it says on the tin, cross-computer/cross-browser bookmark synching now seems to be available...).</p>

<p>They're also useful socially too, of course - pivot browsing by user or tag are great ways of discovering resources related to a particular topic, via a human filter.</p>

<p>That said, the social tool I find I'm using most at the moment on delicious is, actually, a person-to-person tool: link sharing with <em>individuals</em> using the <em>for:</em> tagging construct.</p>

<p>Which brings me to <em>personal</em> learning environments, once again via the Facebook Platform, (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010341.html">Facebook Platform or VLE - where would YOUR students prefer to be?</a>; read more about the Facebook Platform <a href="http://www.disruptiveconversations.com/2007/05/facebook_as_an_.html">here</a>. TechCrunch also has an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/31/the-new-portals-its-the-bread-not-the-peanut-butter/">interesting take</a> on it, comparing the browse model of resource discovery at Yahoo with the search model of Google and the 'social push' sharing model (over a social graph) of Facebook).</p>

<p>In particular, I think the Facebook Platform could be a great <em>personal</em> learning environment because it offers powerful <em>social</em> networking tools, as well as the recently announced possibilities for <em>personal</em> tool integration.</p>

<p>For social tools to succeed, they should also be personally useful. Maybe personal learning environment frameworks*, in turn, need to have rich <em>social</em> functionality to really take off? Which is exactly what Facebook offers.</p>

<p>For institutions, the knowledge that groups can be formed around a particular cohort are also important features - and again, Facebook can offer this sort of functionality.</p>

<p>For individual students, being able to form small working groups (tutor groups, for example) is potentially useful (and something that is observed in OU courses via online tutor group conferences/forums).</p>

<p>*<em>Personal Learning Environment Frameworks</em>: there's been a lot of talk that a <a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/entries/6422883941">"PLE is not a thing"</a> (<a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=39858">Stephen Downes</a> has commented on this quite a bit too) and whilst I agree it's not a thing, I do think that there are containers - or frameworks - that allow a range of personal and social tools, as well as information feeds and storage, to be collected together in some way (via linking or embedding) to offer the user a single 'place to go' to access these tools; a (personal) learning workspace, if you like.</p>

<p>This workspace is personal because the user has some control over the high level navigation and layout of the workspace, as well as some control over the access permissions they can use to share their personal assets with others.</p>

<p>So if I talk of a PLE as a thing, I really mean enabling technologies that let me aggregate a range of tools into a space. And why would I want to do that? So institutional providers can give their students something - a place to go - when they arrive on day one that will provide them with access to tools and information services that they are likely to find useful over the course of their studies.</p>

<p>Being able to disaggregate the tool set, whether by dropping tools or continuing to use them out of the context of the environment (maybe when the student graduates, or in their personal life) are also important requirements.</p>

<h3 class="title">Machine Tags and Automatic Feed Annotation</h3>

<p>Having had <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/07/rss-feed-annotation-streams.html">feed annotation streams</a> brought to mind recently, I was thinking today about a <a href="http://machinetags.org/">machine tag</a> processor that could be used to augment feeds from a service like delicious via some form of <em>tag based programming</em>.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>geo:lat=</em> machine tagging convention allows you to add geo-data to bookmarked items in services like delicious:</p>

<p><em>The Open University in the West Midlands : Home<br />
ou region ouregion region=04 geo:lat=52.4601 geo:long=-1.9449 geotagged</em></p>

<p>(In this example, I further use the "geotagged" tag to identify resources I have geotagged.)</p>

<p>A form of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006019.html">perfomative tagging</a> could then be used to invoke automatic feed annotation - in a sense, I guess the <em>geotagged</em> tag could be used to trigger a geo-annotation service that mines the informal tags of a bookmarked resource for <em>geo:</em> machine tags, and then augments the original feed with the correct geoRSS elements.</p>

<p>Alternatively, just passing the feed through a feed annotation service might cause it to be inspected for machine tags that can trigger feed annotations directly.</p>

<p>This augmented (annotated) feed could then be piped straight into a Google map, for example, to allow the feed items to be displayed directly on a map.</p>

<p>Another useful feed annotation service might be to identify a bookmarked resource as a multimedia file to trigger the annotation of the feed by adding an enclosure tag that could deliver the multimedia item as a payload. This could be done in a couple of ways, for example by virtue of an appropriate filetype suffix (e.g. <em>mpg</em>) or an automatically added <em>mime:type=audio/mpeg</em> machine tag. </p>

<p>(Do any social bookmarking services add mime-type machine tags to bookmarked resources? I wonder how useful it might be if they also did autodiscovery and popped and feeds or microformats that were duly discovered into a <em>feed:url=</em> machine tag...?)</p>

<p>Feed annotations could also be applied pre-emptively to feeds passed through the service: for example, given the bookmarked URL of a youTube movie page, it's easy enough to create the URL for a Flash movie enclosure for that resource.</p>

<p>So what would my <em>feed annotation processor</em> ("feed annotator") do? Well, for starters it would:</p>

<p>- accept an RSS feed, e.g. of resources on delicious;<br />
- inspect each item;<br />
- process machine tags appropriately (e.g. add appropriate geoRSS elements on finding <em>geo:</em> machine tags);<br />
- add enclosure tags based on heuristics (e.g. file suffix, URL (youTube page etc)).</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing I'd like to be trivially able to do in <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a>, but I can't think offhand how to do it?</p>

<p>Maybe <a href="http://popfly.ms">Popfly</a> or the new <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Mashup Editor</a> (any invites going for the latter??? ;-) could be used to implement this sort of functionality easily...?</p>
