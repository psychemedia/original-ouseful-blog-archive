<h3 class="title">(Personal) Data Access via a WIdget</h3>

<!--
<p>Over the weekend, I was pondering the issue of authentication, and how we might be able to expose course profiles badges (from the OU Course profiles Facebook app) in a widget on a public page.</p>

<p>At the moment, course listings for your own courses, and those of other people who have installed the application can be seen on a user's profile page (in cut down form) or on an 'all my courses page'; the intention is that these details can only be seen when you are logged in to Facebook.</p>

<p>(Sort of... Also over the weekend, I spotted an authentication snafu on Course Profiles that has a similar effect to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013899.html">Library onesearch authentication issue</a> - for example, I can log out of Facebook and still look up the courses that other other people have declared as public (albeit presumably on the assumption that means public with in Facebook... or maybe not?) if I know their id number (or guess at a valid one); which is unlikely; but is an outside possibility... That's being fixed at the mo, and as with the library oops, only affects particular instances of browsers that aren't closed after a browsing session on e.g. public access machines.)<br />
   <br />
The question with widget access that comes to my mind is: how can we best make course listing information available for an individual under user, via a widget, according to user privacy control settings?</p>

<p>There are a couple of examples I can think of:</p>

<p>1) the user wants the widget on a display surface behind some authentication layer on an arbitrary computer - e.g. as a widget on a private Netvibes, Pageflakes or Google personal page; in this case, only the user will see the contents of the widget. The user might be able to provide saved authentication details (ideally something like OpenId, though I could imagine this being locally saved Facebook login details; e.g. <a href="http://dev.netvibes.com/doc/howto/authentication">authentication for Netvibes widgets</a>);</p>

<p>2) the user wants to be able to see the widget wherever on their everyday machine in their everyday browser. By using an iframe within the widget, it may be possible to rely on a local cookie to okay the release of info through the widget; this is making a feature out of a weak security policy, but it does mean you are exposed if you use a public access machine and leave one of your cookies on it;</p>

<p>3) the user is happy for anybody to be able to see their information. In this case, all that's required is a user ID number, and a call to a service that returns course listings for that ID if the privacy permissions are set appropriately.</p>

<p>For course profiles information, then approach 3 (subject to user controls) would seem the simplest way forward.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/courseprofiles" rel="tag">courseprofiles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20fb" rel="tag"> fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20widget" rel="tag"> widget</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Last week, I lightened the load on the number of posts (partly because of a trip full of meetings in Milton Keynes, i.e. no work done...), which means I'm not as far on in uncourse as I wanted to be by now - so depending on <em>other stuff</em> I need to get done this week, I may try to up the posting rate. <br />

Whilst the blog posts are intended to be reusable over time, I did pop in a 'time sensitive' phrase in a couple of  posts (e.g. "Writing in yesterday's Technology Guardian supplement (mirrored on the Guardian games blog), Keith Stuart writes: "Is the neverending story of gameplay v narrative over?", in <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/28/games-as-stories-are-games-a-form-of-interactive-fiction/">Games as Stories? Are Games a Form of Interactive Fiction? </a>).</p>

<p>The main reason for doing this was to provide an implicitly documented example of how to break the illusion of a personally delivery schedule that a "daily feed" subscription to the blog by relatively fixing posts in time to another time resource that is absoultely anchored in time.</p>

<p>If I had written something like "When I was putting this post together, an article had appeared in recent edition of the Technology Guardian supplement (mirrored on the Guardian games blog), in which Keith Stuart wrote:" then I wouldn't have been relativey anchoring the post to a fixed point in time.</p>

<p>As it is, that phrase in the post only worked properly on the day the post was written.</p>

<p>I guess it would be possible to write a script that lets you say something like, <em>"Writing in the Technology Guardian ${dateRelativeBackTo('27/3/08')} ago"</em> that would insert "yesterday", "three days ago", "a couple of weeks ago", "several months ago", depending on the current date/date on which the article is read? This could maybe be another component of a fully blown daily feed publishing platform?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/dailyfeeds" rel="tag">dailyfeeds</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library - For *&?Â£$%^%A's Sake...</h3>

 All I want is something like this: DOI: (in the form, e.g. doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1 (though nicely styled, of course, and checking for a leading doi: prefix, adding one if it's not there...) Here's the core of it, in code form......

<p>All I want is something like this:</p>

<form name="doi resolver" action="http://openurl.open.ac.uk.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3" method="get">
DOI:
<input name="id" value="doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1" size="50" type="text"> (in the form, e.g. <em>doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1</em>
<input value="Submit" type="submit">
</form>

<p>(though nicely styled, of course, and checking for a leading <em>doi:</em> prefix, adding one if it's not there...)</p>

<p>Here's the core of it, in code form... (the above form is a real form, not a screenshot, so it should work...)</p>

<p><code>&lt;form name="doi resolver" action="http://openurl.open.ac.uk.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/sfxlcl3"<br />
method="get"&gt;<br />
DOI:<br />
&lt;input type="text" name="id" value="doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1" size="50"&gt; (in the form, e.g. &lt;em&gt;doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1&lt;/em&gt;<br />
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;<br />
&lt;/form&gt;</code></p>

<p>(It uses OU credentials to provide me with authenticated access to the resource, so the above is not much use to you if you don't have an OUCU...)</p>

<p>PS re: the above screenshot, the search also gives the same result for a search on <em>doi</em>; you've no reason to believe me though, (the response doesn't say what the search gave no hits for (as e.g. <em>No results found for <strong>doi resolver</strong></em> would do...).</p>

<p>Try a search here if you don't believe me: <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/">http://library.open.ac.uk/</a>... <em>if</em> you can navigate your way to a search box that is...</p>

<p>... and then pick the right one...</p>

<p>Maybe I chose the wrong one? <em>Did I "Search" or did I "Go", "Go"</em>?! ;-) </p>

<p>And if I search again, which search box am I using? The same one as last time?</p>

<p><em>Nul points...</em></p>

<p>(That said, I <em>can</em> see what they're trying to achieve there... so I don't really mean to be so harsh ;-)<br />

<!--
<p>Tool meme of the week in the bit of the social web I inhabit seems to be the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/_nexus_/">Nexus</a> Facebook application, which just seems to be a prettier version of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendwheel/">friendwheel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2369826952/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2198/2369826952_5637786dc4.jpg" alt="nexus friends analysis" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="399" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This graph is that subset of the social graph Facebook knows about that I can see...</p>

<p>Possibly of  more interest, though, is the "People You May Know" feature that Facebook have just rolled out (<a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/03/26/facebook-starts-suggesting-people-you-may-know/">Facebook starts suggesting 'People You May Know'&#65533;</a>), a clone, apparently, of a Linked In service (<a href="http://blog.adamnash.com/2008/01/03/people-you-may-know-on-linkedin/">People You May Know on Linked In</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368987635/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/2368987635_42658f9108.jpg" alt="people you may know" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="303" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the above, what Facebook appears to be doing is recommending people to me who have a high number of edges in their social graph that connect to nodes (people) that are also in my social graph. Referring back to the Nexus view of my friends netowrk, the recommended friends are people who would not be out of place in my graph, and would be highly connected (i.e. have a high edge count) within it.</p>

<p>I guess one of the simplest (i.e. most literal) ways of identifying these friends is to do something like this:</p>

<p>- over all of my friends, build a list of unique people they have befriended (who are not already my friends);<br />
- count the number of times each person in the list is friended by people who I know;<br />
- if the number is larger than N, recommend that person to me as someone I may know, on the grounds that they know several of the people I know. </p>

<p>I wonder if another way of calculating it would be to look at the Facebook social graph, knock out all the links that connect me to my friends and that connect my friends to each other, and then recommend back to me the people who have the highest closeness, or, err, betweenness on the pruned graph between the people who are my friends?</p>

<p>(I really need to brush up on, extend and deepen my knowledge of graph theory and network analysis! (I have a load of old notes on social bookmark tagging looked at as matrices, somewhere...?) Here are few ways in to the vocab at least, maybe? <a href="http://20bits.com/2007/11/02/graph-theory-part-iii-facebook/">Graph Theory: Part III (Facebook)</a>; <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/mb021/graphtheory.htm">Introduction to Network Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2386029/report">Representation of Online Social Networks</a>. Though it pains me to say so, I may need to leave the blogosphere and hit the literature for a bit... now where did I put all those original small world network papers from Newman, Watts et al.? ;-) Anyone interested in getting an informal study group together, maybe? ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, just to note it so I don't forget it, when I saw the Facebook 'people you may know' results page, I immediately wondered whether there might be mileage in exploring this approach in the context of Course Profiles, using <em>course codes</em> to identify potential closeness of relationship with people I don't already know? (i.e. offering enhancements to, or refinements of, the current Study Buddy and Course Recommender services?</p>

<p>For example, for students who had declared the same courses and the same presentation dates for more than one course, we might be able to recommend "people you may remember studying with" (we'd have to have a privacy setting to out of this, of course).</p>

<p>For students who had taken, are taking and intend to take the same courses at similar times, we might be able to recommend potentially long lasting study friendships along the lines of "people who may be on the same course pathway as you". Where the courses (and ordered sequence of courses) is the same as someone else, but the dates are different, the recommendations may be of the form "people who have previously taken a similar pathway to you" and "people who are intending to take a similar pathway to the one you took/are taking" (that is, identifying mentoring or 'old hand' relationships between people at opposite ends of a qualification pathway).</p>

<p>[It's important to note here that I see Course Profiles as providing access to a graph, in part through app specific data, in part through access to Facebook data, that has two sorts of node (people and courses) and three sorts of edge (course-course, course-person, person-person), each of which may have several possible flavours. On different views over the graph, some of the edges may be directed (e.g. 'this course taken <em>after</em> that course') and ordered into lists (sequences of courses in the order they are taken, for example), and some may be weighted (e.g. '23 people took this course <em>at the same time as</em> that course, or 'this person is taking that 30 point course' (I don't know if properties of one class of node should be exposed as the weight of an edge when connected to a node of another class, but hey, it's something to learn about, right?!;-).]</p>

<p>Now ,do I start tinkering with my Python/Course Profiles analysis code again and see if I can get some 'people you may have known' code working, or do I fire up the Quattro and catch up on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/ashestoashes/">Ashes to Ashes</a>?<br />

<h3 class="title">Progressive Enhancement - Some Examples</h3>

<!--
<p>This post complements the previous rant (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014013.html">Raising Expectations via Progressive Enhancement</a>) by providing a couple of examples of how progressive enhancement can be used to improve a user's experience of a web page if their browser is capable of it...</p>

<p>In many of the cases, progressive enhancement builds on good basic design principles, design for accessibility, and increasingly, semantically sensitive design (e.g. though the use of microformats and semantic design markup).</p>

<p><h3>Progressively Enhancing Data Tables</h3><br />
The first example is one regular readers will already be familiar with - the idea of an 'accessible chart' (as described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013114.html">RESTful Image Generation - When Text Just Won't Do</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, tabular data included in a web page can be progressively enhanced to display a graphical view of the data. Good examples can be found at <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/01/17/tables-and-charts/">Automatic conversion from simple, accessible data tables to YUI Charts</a>, <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/01/08/generating-charts-from-accessible-data-tables-using-the-google-charts-api/">Generating charts from accessible data tables using the google charts API</a> and <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/creating_accessible_charts_using_canvas_and_jquery/">Creating accessible charts using canvas and jQuery (<em>filament group</em>)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368701002/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2057/2368701002_13e365a02f.jpg" width="419" height="286" alt="Charts from tables" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>If the table is marked up appropriately, an included Javascript file will automatically enhance the table with a graphical view.</p>

<p>The filament group library will actually generate a whole range of chart types from a table - pie charts, line charts, area charts, bar charts and stacked bar charts.</p>

<p>Data tables themselves can be progressivley enhanced to make tables skinnable, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_clientsorting.html">sortable by columns,</a> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_rowselect.html">selectable by rows</a> (or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_cellselect.html">cell</a>), <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_colshowhide_source.html">reorderable</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_cellediting.html">editable</a> and so on.  If table rows and columns are marked up appropriately, controls like the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI DataTable</a> will add the progressive enhancements <em>for free</em> with the inclusion of a single Javascript file (check out the YUI DataTable examples to see just what's possible).</p>

<p><h3>Progressively Enhancing Forms</h3><br />
The accessible slider is a progressive enhancement of a drop down, enumerated list.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2367888065/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2142/2367888065_e49ab2c858.jpg" width="422" height="253" alt="Accessible slider" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>For an example,  visit: <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/developing_an_accessible_slider/">Developing an accessible slider</a>.</p>

<p>Other form elements are amenable to progressive enhancement too. For example, radio button lists (via <a href="http://somedirection.com/2008/03/24/jquery-ratings-a-progressive-enhancement-approach/">jQuery Ratings - A Progressive Enhancement Approach</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2367897895/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2367897895_6bb1f127bb.jpg" width="500" height="161" alt="2008-03-28_1137" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>Although not available as a progressive enhancement library, it should be possible to extend the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/">YUI slider control</a> library so that it could progressively enhance radio button lists with a YUI slider.</p>

<p>If you have a text entry box on your form, wouldn't it be nicer to use something like this?</p>

<p><h3>Progressively Enhancing Links</h3><br />
Finally, a return to something I've been going on about for ages (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">Interaction Design - "Now Follow This Link"</a>), the use of lightboxes to view linked pages and embedded movies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368753544/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2368753544_8400b219ac.jpg" width="500" height="440" alt="lightbox preview" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>(See the original page beneath the semi-transparent black layer?) One of the nicest libraries I've seen to achieve this effect can be found, complete with a range of demos, at <a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/">Shadowbox.js by Michael J. I. Jackson</a>. </p>

<p>(Related are page previewers like <a href="http://cooliris.com/site/flock/tutorial_cp_flock.php">Cool Iris</a> and the annoying <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap previewer</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally, link enhacement in terms of linked to resources - and Scribd. Using a scribd progressive enhancement library, PDF document links found within a page can be rewritten to either link to a Flash preview of the document on scribd, or embedded withing the page directly using Scribd iPaper:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2367927459/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2367927459_982be9c061.jpg" width="500" height="471" alt="scribd ipaper" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>(See also <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013371.html">No More PDF Reader Hell? Hello iPaper - You Taking Note...?</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013390.html">Scribd iPaper Bookmarklets and Greasemonkey Script</a> and my iPaper utilities page: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/iPaper/">OUseful Scribd iPaper Tools</a>.)</p>

<p><h3>Programming Code</h3><br />
Styling programming code in online materials can be an issue. But it is possible to progressively enhance code in a language sensitive way, using colour coding techniques found in the majority of code editors. Here's an example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368037471/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/2368037471_c9a275b1cd.jpg" width="500" height="167" alt="Code view progressive enhancement" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>All that's included in the page is this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368040433/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2105/2368040433_87d5b32850.jpg" width="500" height="113" alt="progressive enhancement - code markup" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>The bounding box, menu options, line numbering and code coloring are all progressive enhancements using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> code library.</p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3><br />
This post has reviewed several examples of progressive enhancement in action. Some of the rationale for using progressive enhancement as a way of rolling out user interface innovations is described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014013.html">Raising Expectations via Progressive Enhancement</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>Traditional engineering often favours the approach of <em>graceful degradation</em>, in which a system continues to operate in the face of parts of the system failing for one reason or another.</p>

<p>In the area of web design, web developers must code their web pages to cope with a wide variety of browsers. In institutions such as the OU, a computer specification might well define the minimum version browsers that all our online course materials will work with properly. Looking at the range of browsers, each with its own quirks and foibles, one might design a page for one browser and then customise it with exception handlers to render properly in the other supported browsers. In some cases, a page may be designed to 'degrade gracefully' in older browsers.</p>

<p>At the OU, where students must find their own computers to work with (rather than coming onto campus and using centrally provided and maintained computers) making course materials widely accessible means that we often code for the lowest common denominator - the oldest supported browser. With a student body covering a huge demographic, it can be difficult for us to innovate on behalf of our users and force them to upgrade their computer systems on a regular basis... which can make rolling out innovations that exploit new browser technologies, for example, hard to achieve.</p>

<p>Along with our declaration of 'openness', there is also a desire to be equitable, and provide all students with a similar, high quality experience. Of course I sign up to this, but I don't think this means that every student should be forced to use materials designed for lowest common denominator technologies. (After all, we can have students ranging from postgrads and professionals, to people fresh out of school with no qualifications studying on the same course: giving them exactly the same book or web page to read does not mean they will necessarily experience the same benefits from it).</p>

<p>So what to do? Potentially, the idea of <em>progressive enhancement</em> offers a way forward here.</p>

<p>In this case, the page is deliberately designed to work well on the lowest common denominator platform, and then dynamic techniques (Javascript and CSS) are used to progressively enhance the user experience according to the capabilities of the browser. (See the post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014014.html">Progressive Enhancement - Some Examples</a> for some examples.; <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/progressive-css-enhancement/"> Progressive CSS Enhancement</a> briefly reviews some of the differences between javascript and CSS enhancement.; <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/progressive-enhancement-and-the-yahoo-u/">Progressive Enhancement and the Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI)</a> also provides a good introduction to the technique.)</p>

<p>This change in stance towards web page design is both subtle and profound. By adopting a progressive enhancement approach, you are making a declaration that you will try to improve the user experience on the page by making use of appropriate technologies as they become available, rather than saying - "okay, page built, now all I have to do is fix it for those other crappy browsers..."</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement also allows for implicit A/B testing.</p>

<p>(I don't think we do A/B testing on courses to try to figure out what works and what doesn't across large scale, live courses. There are two reasons for this: firstly, equitability (students on the same course should receive exactly the same stuff presented in exactly the same way, irrespective of their personal capabilities, computer specifications and so on); secondly, the bane of all education research, if the experience is a bad one, then it's potentially messed up that learner's 'real' education.)</p>

<p>By using progressive enhancement, students with more powerful browsers, who may be early adopters (and therefore potentially more forgiving in case of errors, as well as having higher expectations), will get to try out new display techniques and metaphors, and provide feedback from a real, learning context. Because the features are progressive enhancements, they can be switched off by the user if they are intrusive, annoying or just plain broken.</p>

<p>Albeit in the absence of evidence ;-), I'd argue that progressive enhancement could play an important role in the innovation pipeline, particularly insofar as it relates to the design and presentation of online educational materials (the 'elearning' word is dead, isn't it?)</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement also allows you to innovate on behalf of your users. Users on old browsers can be shown previews of the enhanced experience through screencasts and screenshots and encouraged to upgrade if they want to avail themselves of those features.</p>

<p>In short, sticking with design techniques that <em>only</em> work for lowest common denominator technologies will stifle innovation. By adopting a progressive enhancement approach, materials can be designed for lowest common denominator technologies, and then extended and improved for use on improved technology platforms.</p>

<p>In this way, a minimum quality of service can be guaranteed, with alternative, potentially higher quality, user interface experiences available to anyone who wants to avail themselves of them.</p>

<p>If I use a latest generation browser, my knowledge of what sorts of interactions the web can support/what browsers are capable of as well as my expectations of what counts as a good quality web experience are likely to be very different to someone who only uses their old browser for accessing Hotmail.<br />

<!--
<p>When we released the first OU Facebook application - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012552.html">Course Profiles</a> - we built it around several core principles:<br />
<ol><li>it should be useful as a personal application;</li><li>it should be increasingly useful as a social application as the installed user base increased;</li><li>it should encourage social sharing ("virality");</li><li>it should be respectful of users' privacy concerns.<br />
</li></ol>One thing we did not design into Course Profiles was a reason for users to visit it on a regular basis. Once courses are added to your profile, you only need to revisit the app to change their status (e.g. change a course from being currently studied to previously studied [note to self - the application could manage this transition itself if it knew the course start and end dates?]). The Study Buddy feature is another 'occasional visit' feature&nbsp; - that is, finding a study buddy for a course is not necessarily something you want to try to do again and again on a regular basis; even monitoring which friends have declared a course that you have declared is not a feature that makes Course Profiles sticky. The commenting feature might provide a reason for regularly checking the app, but commenting has not really taken off; a much needed redesign of the interface, surfacing some of the functionality hidden in the course actions panel, might improve uptake of the course comments facility, but whilst it's something we have had on the cards for a long time, we haven't pursued it.</p>

<p>Today, we're announcing our second OU Facebook application: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=11926232497">My OU Story</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the application has been designed with the four key principles identified above, as well as another two:<br />
<ul><li>the application should be compatible with Course Profiles;</li><li>the application should encourage users to visit it regularly.<br />
</li></ul>So what exactly is My OU Story? In short, it's an application that allows you to write short posts about particular courses, associate your mood with those posts, and receive supportive feedback from your friends about those posts. A "Mood graph" provides a summary view of your mood over time. A river of news provides a snapshot view of stories that have been posted by other application users, and makes it easy for you to send them supportive comments in return.</p>

<p>The My OU Story app has been put together by the same team that developed Course Profiles (with some additional creative input in the original creative meeting by Ian Roddis [who blogs where???;-)] - Liam has the low down, in part, about the process we went through creating the app.: <a href="http://www.greenhughes.com/content/new-facebook-application-my-ou-story">New Facebook application: My OU Story</a></p>

<p>As a bit of a tease, here's Stuart's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATHksF4YJrE">My OU Story screencast</a> - I'll post in a little more detail about various aspects of the app over the next week or two. </p>

<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" height="350" width="425"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ATHksF4YJrE" wmode="transparent" quality="high" menu="false" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></object><br />
   <br />
As for our aspirations for this app? Well, we'd like to think that it's exploring one possible mechanism for encouraging peer support, though the ability to offer supportive comments/messages to someone who's maybe signaled they're having a hard time on a course; or alternatively, share their success with a congratulatory comment when they're particularly happy with something they've achieved on a course.</p>

<p>If used regularly, correlating mood graphs across users on a course might turn up insights regarding the pacing or difficulty of a course. A couple of things I'm looking out for are 'nodal mood points', where everybody's mood appears to be in synch, (for example, a particularly difficult part of the course might correspond to large numbers of students struggling with a course and finding it hard going), and the distribution of emotional states around assessment time.</p>

<p>It is well known that Google Trends has predictive potential (for example, look at the trend for this search on <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=roses">roses</a>;-), and whilst Google has orders of magnitude more users than we can ever expect for My OU Story, there is an outside possibility that aggregated mood statuses might be predictive of things like assessment dates. (How useful that would be, I'm not sure.... but it might illuminate how far in advance of an assessment students' mood starts to be affected by the impending deadline.)<br />
PS while we're being all emotional, this post by chance shows how emotional status indicators are starting to appear on user feedback forms: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/good_ui_design_make_it_easy_show_me_you_care.php">Good UI Design: Make It Easy, Show Me You Care</a><div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fb" rel="tag">fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20my%20ou%20stroy" rel="tag"> my ou stroy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20course%20profiles" rel="tag"> course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Yahoo Pipes Badges Make It Easy to Share Google Calendar Maps</h3>

<p>A comment on the previous post pointed to a use case example of how to embed a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013846.html">Google Calendar Map (gCalmap)</a> in a blog entry using a Yahoo Pipes map badge: <a href="http://www.saenz.info/2008/03/mapa-de-conciertos-de-rem-2008.html">Mapa de conciertos de R.E.M. 2008</a> (Map of REM 2008 Tour dates (if anyone from the REM production team is reading, three passes to the Southampton gig would be much appreciated ;-):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2361011990/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2361011990_e92daff513.jpg" alt="2008-03-25_1011" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="470" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The  badges also have a link that makes it easy to share the map (see the <em>Get This &gt;&gt;</em> link bottom right?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2361008342/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2118/2361008342_89a71192b0.jpg" alt="2008-03-25_1008" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="440" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>An element of badge customisation is possible too: for example, I can set the size and change the badge type (the gCal XML is the user input specified in the original pipe):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2360183333/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2360183333_d7de7948bc.jpg" alt="2008-03-25_1016" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="446" width="483" /></a></p>

<p>That said, it would be really handy to be able to change the badge title, particularly for utility pipes like the gCalMap pipe, where any given map will correspond to a particular calendar/series of events (and will thus merit its own title; in this case "REM Tour Dates, 2008", for example).</p>

<p>The embed code is actually a javascript include, which means it probably won't show through in a feed reader, though you should be able to see it if you click through:</p>

<p><script src="http://pipes.yahoo.com/js/mapbadge.js">{"pipe_id":"d696db6de1dda5c86fc8fa59bbef6aec","_btype":"map","pipe_params":{"gCalXml":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/calendar\/feeds\/aitpsi6ua29s6lsbevm5basne4@group.calendar.google.com\/public\/basic"},"width":"500","height":"300"}</script></p>

<p>(If you need to embed an iframe, then there's still muy own <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013846.html">gCalMap embed code generator</a>.)</p>

<p>It could be handy to be able to see the pipe's info/description information in the pop-up panel, as well as a few more customisation options, but maybe that's on the cards already? <div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/REM" rel="tag">REM</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pipes" rel="tag">pipes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20gcalmap" rel="tag"> gcalmap</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20calendar%20map" rel="tag"> calendar map</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I also did a 'techniques' post on the <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info blog</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013966.html">Disaggregating the Notion of PLEs #1 - PCVs: Personal (Portable?) Content Views</a>, where I commented on the  way that RSS feeds from the Digital Worlds blog could be used to generate different content views over the uncourse.</p>

<p>That post also introduced the <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/video-channel/">Digital Worlds splashcast video channel</a>, where I intend to start to pulling together compilation video shows from posts where I link out to several youtube videos all in one go. I still haven't worked out how actually do the shows so that they work as standalone items (for convenience, I just bundled the videos together with some short text interstitial caption screens) so if you have any examples of best practice 'educational' video compilations from youtube movies as a splashcast show (or alternative) please let me know! ;-)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/19/oscilliscopy/">"Oscilloscopy"</a> post several movies for one of the video shows, and it actually got picked up by a couple of other blogs, that in turn mentioned other related vides (that I then linked out to from comments to the Ocilloscopy post). I also added the externally referenced movies to the show...</p>

<p>This 'content accretion through comments and trackbacks' is quite a gentle way of sourcing "user-discovered content". In particular, I wonder how it might work e.g. in the case of finding content that could be used to keep a real course fresh presentation on presentation, or help source content for a course review/rewrite (I'm thinking of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t184">T184 Robotics and the Meaning of Life</a> course here - though there's still time to register on what might be its final (or maybe penultimate) presentation in its current form, which starts in May..;-)</p>

<p>I also wonder to what extent 'user solicited content' might be used in shaping hte direction, emphasis or delivery of a course, e.g. in terms of being responsive to reader comments from one post to the next, and trying to address issues that crop up in comments from within the body of the blog - that is, the "formal" posts made through it. Read/Write Web are experimenting with a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rww_comments_competition.php">Comment of the Day</a> competition, in which they pick the best comment of the day and "(in a further effort to extend the conversation), we'll publish it as a separate new post on ReadWriteWeb."</p>

<p>I wonder if a "question of the week" comment on an uncourse blog could be used to help keep the blog responsive to reader interests, or if things got really active, whether a "comment of the day" could be used to set the direction of the following day's post in true uncourse style! (That would, of course, require a very active commenting community!)</p>

<p>Anyway, the experiment continues... today was the first day I haven't posted to Digital Worlds since the experiment properly began (though I may sneak something out before midnight - or maybe not...) and I'm not sure what tomorrow's post will be about yet...</p>

<p>If you have any comments about the way it's shaping up (or not) please feel free to comment here... or there...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/uncourse" rel="tag">uncourse</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I've just managed to steal a little time to play with a couple of the new Google Visualisation gadgets. There seem straightforward enough to use, and the integration with Google spreadsheets means that one you get the data into a spreadsheet you can start to play with it.</p>

<p>I went off and pinched some data from UCAS (<a href="http://www.ucas.com/about_us/stat_services/stats_online/data_tables/abushei/">UCAS admissions data</a>) and used it to generate a Trendalyser view - now known as a Motion Chart - was trivial (feed readers, you'll have to click through to see and play with it ;-)</p>

<p>Firstly, a look at how admissions are faring in a handful of institutions:</p>

<p><iframe width='450' height='471' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' src='http://k2alr2pc-a.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?up__table_query_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ftq%3Frange%3DB1%253AH32%26key%3Dp1rHUqg4g422xIt4UXCxsVg%26gid%3D0%26pub%3D1&up_title=UCAS%20Admissions%20data%20(example)&up_state=&up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fig%2Fmodules%2Fmotionchart.xml' style='border: 1px solid #cccccc'></iframe></p>

<p>Here's another one, this time looking at some demographics data:</p>

<p><iframe width='450' height='471' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' src='http://k2alr2pc-a.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?up__table_query_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ftq%3Frange%3DA2%253AAJ7%26key%3Dp1rHUqg4g422aUaJQmA2nRQ%26gid%3D0%26pub%3D1&up_title=UCAS%20(demographics)&up_state=&up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fig%2Fmodules%2Fmotionchart.xml' style='border: 1px solid #cccccc'></iframe></p>

<p>Now, I wonder what sorts of things we can do with the Course Profiles data...? ;-)<br />

<p>Driving up to MK the other day, I was pondering the various very good reasons why the central IT folks probably don't like the idea of the people they 'support' moving over to services like Google docs (as <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/03/google-up-your.html">Martin has done</a>)...</p>

<p>...and the main one, I guess, is loss of control of the data - and the app... becasue we all know that OUr IT folks offer an implicit SLA* that can't be bettered , right? ;-)</p>

<p>But there's an obvious solution, isn't there? Just make one of these a little bigger, and get it running apps as well as search routines. Grab code updates from the net whenever they're pushed, but always run the app locally...</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.co.uk/enterprise/gsa/images/GSA_beautyshot.jpg" style="" title="" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the joy of it - for small business particularly - would be that all the installation you'd need to do would be to plug it in to the local network and switch it on...</p>

<p><img src="http://www.builderau.com.au/i/s/gmini2.jpg" style="width: 279px; height: 209px;" title="" alt="" />  </p>

<p>So what am I missing? Why are they only selling the <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/">Google search appliances</a>?</p>

<p>*A year or two ago, I was told that LTS, our in-house s/w developer team, used to have to delete old code because the disks were full... Apparently, it's still happening. I've got a spare 1 gig USB thumb drive here, if that'd be any use to them? ;-) </p>

<p>"So what did you do at the office today, dear?"

<h3 class="title">Disaggregating the Notion of PLEs #1 - PCVs: Personal (Portable?) Content Views</h3>

There's been a flurry of posts lately about PLEs - Brian today, Martin a few days ago, AJ over the last couple of weeks (also check out his What the heck is a PLE? tutorial). So I've taken a step...
<!--
<p>There's been a flurry of posts lately about PLEs - <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/03/21/ple-10-and-ple-20/">Brian</a> today, <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/03/a-ple---vle-con.html">Martin</a> a few days ago, <a href="http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/">AJ</a> over the last couple of weeks (also check out his <a href="http://www.microbiologybytes.com/tutorials/ple/">What the heck is a PLE?</a> tutorial). So I've taken a step back from that in the context of the Digital Worlds uncourse, and started thinking about how certain publishing platforms - like blog engines - can <em>afford</em> (;-) particular sorts of personal content reuse.</p>

<p>So I've started thinking about as PLE as a bleurghhhh sort of concept (meh?! ;-), and 'disaggregated' the PLE notion into personal content views, personal 'editing' tool suites [UPDATE: and personal publishing tools] (when viewed from the <em>user</em> side) and <em>portable</em> content views and user application provision [UPDATE: and user publishing tools] (when viewed from an institutional perspective).</p>

<p>So how might portable/personal content views work on the Digital Worlds uncourse blog?</p>

<p>I've already mentioned how by making use of blog categories I can generate separate views over the content either on a page level (click on the category tag on the blog and see a reverse chronological river of posts view of posts in that category) or feed level. The feeds can then be piped into a webdesktop such as Netvibes of Pageflakes as separate entities and used to re-present the content in a form that suits the user.</p>

<p>Here's a global desktop view I've been working on in Pageflakes (<a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful/22031456">Digital Worlds (global desktop)</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2348890885/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2348890885_979886c625.jpg" alt="2008-03-21_1117" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="305" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The left hand column has a 'traditional' reverse chronological view of the most recent posts to the blog. The central column is topped by a Splashcast video player (more about that in a moment) and then two views of particular categories I have posted under in the blog. (These might correspond to a topic that lasts a week, say, or a set of tutorials on using a particular application). As these views are supposed to recreate a particular topical narrative, they are presented in chronological order (which means reversing the order of items in the original feed).. The third column has another category feed ("Friday Fun" and a view of the most recent comments to the blog as a whole.</p>

<p>Another Pageflakes view focuses just on the Game Maker tutorials (<a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful/22238750">Digital Worlds (Game Maker) pagecast</a>), the idea being that this component of the uncourse might be of interest on its own. (Bearing this in mind, I also defined a <em>GMFree</em> category that contains all the non-Game maker posts.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2349001189/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/2349001189_a989ee7852.jpg" alt="2008-03-21_1246" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="264" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(Using a similarly selective approach as to which feeds are displayed, someone who wasn't practically minded might create a page that only had game studies type feeds displayed, and did not re-present any of the hands-on tutorials.)</p>

<p>My original intention was to populate the tabs for each game by filtering the GameMaker category feed from the blog by tag (using a tags for each different game tutorial). (Here's a pipe to do that: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=71d2684995510201006a2f08fdfa4fb7">Digital Worlds: Cat and Tag Reverse view</a>).</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately</em>, the category feed only displays the most recent 10 (?) items, and there are more than that number of items in the category feed....AARRGGGG - aha moment - there are <em>tag feeds</em> too... e.g. <em>http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/tag/mazegame/feed</em>...</p>

<p>Okay - so my original workaround was to build a Grazr OPML reading list for each tag containing links to all the pages in a particular game tutorial and then display this (after RSSification!) in a Pageflakes panel... but I don't have to do that, do I, as long as there are no more than 10 (?) items in a <em>tag</em> feed... (I also want to reverse the feed so it is in chronological order, using the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/reverse">Feed Reverser pipe</a>).</p>

<p>As well as displaying the tag feeds on the Pageflakes page, I also use them to generate separate OPML feeds that point to a list of comment feeds for each post in the tag feed, like this view of <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/xmltools/dwCommentFeedsOPML.php?id=c48d4aa1">Comments and Trackbacks for the maze Game Posts</a>. These OPML comment feeds are then displayed on the Pageflakes page using a Grazr widget. So now, for each tag feed, I can view the posts tagged that way, and the comments to those posts.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure if I can get a comments by category feed out of Wordpress? But I can make one, right? Just get the category feed, and then for each post derive the URL for the comments feed for each post, and then merge all these?)</p>

<p><h3>The Splashcast Video Channel</h3><br />
Several of the posts in the uncourse are built around 3 or 4 video clips from Youtube. An alternative way to view these movies is to recast the linear blogpost as a 'video show' (I've used this approach before with <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html">We Ignore Digital Media at OU Peril - the Movie</a>).</p>

<p>So, I've started to pull together some 'shows' based around posts that have already gone up, and will continue to add shows to the Digital Worlds channel as time goes on...</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/so/1/p/MJQJ5170BJ" wmode="transparent" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="400" width="600"><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="600"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=UWJH8025YE" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add Digital Worlds to your page</font></a></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>I need to think about how best to add 'continuity text' to explain why particular movies are being show - and indeed what the focus of the particular 'show' is, but I canlt do <em>everyhting</em> all at once, right? ;-)</p>

<p><h3>Moving Forward</h3><br />
Once again, I've run up against some constraints within the hosted Wordpress solution. The following would be handy:<br />
- a <em>complete</em> feed containing <em>all</em> the items in particular tag or category (i.e. no cap on the number of items per feed);<br />
- a 'reverse feed' url to present the feed items in chronological order (again, unlimited in the number of items that can be displayed);<br />
- an OPML feed publication mechanism (global, category and tag levels) that lists the full content of each post in a feed as an OPML items (so an RSS feed item becomes an OPML content item) followed by a link to the RSS feed for the comments for that item;<br />
- alternatively, it might be more appropriate if the comments feed for each post could be headed by an item containing the original post (that is to say, generate an RSS feed for each post containing the original post as well as it comments). </p>

<p>This is of course, a work in progress. Any and all comments appreciated....<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ple" rel="tag">ple</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pcv" rel="tag">pcv</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20digitalworlds" rel="tag"> digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20splashcast" rel="tag"> splashcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Great news today, from a notice Kate spotted on OU Student Home (and that Liam twittered about last week - internal readers can find it here: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/documents/5/kj081503091445840.pdf">Studying at the Open University with an Apple Mac computer</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Studying at the Open University with an Apple Mac computer<br />
March 2008 </p>

<p>This document describes the current situation at the Open University (OU) for students who use Apple Macintosh computers. </p>

<p>Open University students use a range of printed materials, CDs, DVDs and online resources. In February 2007 the University launched a new virtual learning environment (VLE), providing increasing amounts of this learning content via the Web, and giving access to dynamic information such as assignment results. Online content is currently tested with the following browsers: Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7, and Mozilla Firefox. In addition, the University is considering testing web content on the Mac-based Safari platform.&nbsp; In the meantime, Mac users can access the VLE by downloading and installing Mozilla Firefox, version 2 or higher. <br />
...<br />
The policy of authoring for Windows machines was decided at a time when most courses used fixed media rather than the Internet and less than 3% of the public (and OU students) were using Macs.  It was not possible to justify the costs of developing and supporting cross-platform fixed media products.  Most new DVDs for OU courses are however being produced using a browser-based interface which means they will run on Macs as well as PCs.<br />
...<br />
The University is currently carrying out its own audit of course materials to check Mac compatibility, and is examining ways to provide access for both Mac users and users of other platforms such as Linux.</blockquote><br />
So  - Firefox has traction (it's also included on the Online Apps DVD that goes out to students each year). I'd personally try to push Flock, but I guess Firefox is a start... ;-)</p>

<p>Also in my feeds today, a press announcement that proudly declares <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=13268">Open University students trial interactive screen experiments</a> (Stuart has denied this was his press release... but maybe that was <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=156">just an excuse...</a>? LOL;-):<br />
<blockquote>An innovative new kind of physics experiment is being introduced for science students on Open University courses this year. Interactive screen experiments (ISEs) use Flash technology to allow students to carry out a real experiment using a standard home computer and web browser.</blockquote>This is a neat idea, and looks to complement some of the remote internet lab work KMi et al. did several years ago, but... (there's always a but, when you look at the detail...)... chasing the story a little, it looks as if the apps are being developed in <em>Shockwave, not Flash</em>.<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/activities/details/detail.php?itemId=4612203073f3a">Developing interactive screen-based versions of real physics experiments using Shockwave movies</a></p>

<p>An interactive screen experiment (ISE) is a highly interactive Shockwave movie that runs entirely under user control by clicking and dragging on the knobs and buttons on the experimental equipment.  The movie comprises hundreds or thousands of image frames recording every state of the equipment.  <strong>The movie can be played in an ordinary web browser with a free Shockwave plug-in.  Shockwave is widely used for the web delivery of movies and is highly suited for interactive control (it is used in the production of computer video games). </strong> When the student runs an ISE the effect is very similar to a running a remote-control experiment. The difference for the laboratory provider is that there is no limit to the number of students who may simultaneously run the experiment and the real equipment itself is used only once. [My emphasis]</blockquote>This doesn't make much difference for <em>Windows</em> users, (except for the need to download an extra plugin), but... err...: may I refer the interested reader to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/">http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/</a> (non-Windows PC is typically the definition of a non-standard/alternate/alternative platform; that said, I think that for some apps, Windows Vista is also classed this way;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2343112220/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2343112220_dbaf68f492.jpg" alt="Shickwave compatability" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="312" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(Contemporary Macs are Intel, not Power PC, Macs...)</p>

<p>[UPDATE: Shockwave does now work on Intel Macs...]</p>

<p>So if you have a recent Mac, or run Linux, maybe even Vista, then as far as the ISEs would appear to go, err, hmmm... well, you can still get the text content from Moodle :-)</p>

<p>PS I'll be happy when I can view everything through my Wii browser ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>I really should be thinking about how to get through my mashup talk on Thursday, so I thought I'd do this instead - a quick update on <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/geotwitterous">geotwitterous</a>.</p>

<p>In a comment to the original post (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012696.html">Geo Twitter - GeoCoding Your Tweets and Plotting Them on an Embeddable Map</a>), which described a Yahoo peipe that tried to geocode a tweet based on its content,  Jean-NoÃ«l asked: "Why not create a Pipes using API TwitterVision?"</p>

<p>If you don't know it already, Twittervision plots tweets on a map based on the twitterer's location, as specified in theri Twitter profile, or if it's declared in a tweet in a particular way. A quick look at the <a href="http://twittervision.com/api.html">Twittervision API</a> showed how easy it is to call. FOr example:</p>

<p>- <em>http://api.twittervision.com/user/current_status/<strong>twitterID</strong>.xml</em><br />
- <em>http://api.twittervision.com/user/current_status/<strong>twitterID</strong>.json</em></p>

<p>It only took a few minutes to create pipe to grab this data (<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twittervisionapi">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twittervisionapi</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2343058868/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2343058868_5d4c5f6592.jpg" alt="2008-03-18_1037" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="430" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This pipe in turn can be embedded in another pipe that takes in a normal twitter friends feed and then grabs the twittervision details for each user who has a tweet in that feed - <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twittervisionfriends">http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/twittervisionfriends</a>. here are some of the interesting bits:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2342234869/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/2342234869_5af2d40f77.jpg" style="border: 0pt none ;" alt="Twittervision friends pipe" height="412" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The regular expression finds the author (as a twitter ID) of each tweet. The Loop runs each item in the feed through the twittervision API pipe, enriching/augementing/annotating the feed with whatever Twittervision can learn about the user. Any geo information returned from twittervision is copied to the top of each feed item so it looks like geoRSS. The Location Extractor uses this geoRSS info to create a full internal geo representation; (if no geoRSS info is found, it will try to extract a location from the title/description elements of each feed item).</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/geotwitterous/?id=psychemedia&amp;twittervision=on">geotwitterous page</a>, I then take a  JSON output from the pipe and plot the tweets on a Google map, trying to bundle all the tweets from the same person together:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2342244053/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/2342244053_7baff64409.jpg" alt="geotwitterous map" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="349" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So  - a map view of where my friends are twittering from...</p>

<p>I need to fully integrate this with my own twitter geocoder, but as a half-hour hack, it was quite satisfying :-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/geotwitterous" rel="tag">geotwitterous</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twittervision" rel="tag">twittervision</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20yahoo%20pipes" rel="tag"> yahoo pipes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20pipes" rel="tag"> pipes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mashup" rel="tag"> mashup</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/a-two-room-maze-game/">A Two Room Maze Game </a></li></ul>

<p>I also created a timeline at <a href="http://xtimeline.com/timeline/History-of-Games">http://xtimeline.com/timeline/History-of-Games</a> to act as the focus for a user discovered content activity (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013891.html">"Playing" at Soliciting Learner Generated Content</a>). Providing access rights so blog readers can edit the timeline is a bit of a pain (I can't make it public, or provide user password, for example. The admin has to invite a user, or they have to contact the admin, and then edit permissions have to be granted.)</p>

<p>One problem I've noticed with the Wordpress theme I'm using is that the category links on each post point to a corresponding Wordpress tag page, rather than the blog category page. There doesn't seem to be an obvious link to the feed for each category, either (though feeds are available: just add <em>/feed</em> to the end of the Wordpress category page URL, for example <em>http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/category/what-is-a-game/feed</em>).</p>

<p>I've started exploring a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010298.html">glanceable</a> view over the uncourse using a Pageflakes pagecast page. I haven't posted about this on the Digital Worlds blog yet - I'm still working on a first pass stable version - but as it has elements of PLEness about it, I thought I'd post a link to it here: <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful/22031456">Digital Worlds Pagecast</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2335406855/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2392/2335406855_44bdd29bb7.jpg" width="500" height="292" alt="Digital Worlds pagecast" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>The tabs are fed by separate category feeds, run via a simple Yahoo <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/reverse">feed item order reversing pipe</a>, to be the feed items in category panels into presentation order, rather than the typical category feeds' reverse chronological order.</p>

<p>I'm also considering experimenting with a <a href="http://drop.io/digitalworlds">drop.io</a> box for file sharing. Whilst drop.io does offer a widget for file uploads, and RSS feed notifications of uploads to a storage area, the widget doesn't display the most recent 5 entries to the box, say, let alone a full contents listing... which is on my feature request list for them ;-)</p>

<p>Workload-wise, it's taking me on average about an hour and a half per post at the moment, though I have been drawing on previously made notes in some cases, particulary for the Game Maker activities. Included in that time is resource discovery (e.g. on flickr and youtube), as well as 'reflection' on how to do various things - e.g. for the timeline post, I tried out various ways of how to introduce the activity. As it is, I think the timeline activity is underspecified, but I've added a few thoughts about that in the comments to the post.</p>

<p>As I enter new territory (i.e. fewer notes) I'm expecting things to level out at up to 2 hours per post, which will mean up to 4 hours per day, on average for 2 x 800-1000 word illustrated posts, including minor activities/self-reflection questions. The Game Maker activities may also require additional preparation time.</p>

<h3 class="title">Google Book Bar Wizard and Books Viewability API</h3>

I wasn't going to post on this till I'd built something, but I have no time to build any library related mashups at the mo (unless I do one live in the session next week, maybe?) so here's a screenshot...
<!--
<p>I wasn't going to post on this till I'd built something, but I have no time to build any library related mashups at the mo (unless I do one live in the session next week, maybe?) so here's a <a href="http://webcat.hud.ac.uk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?full=3100001%7E%21578680%7E%210&amp;profile=cls">screenshot from Dave P's catalogue at Huddersfield</a> (link via one of the Talis blogs - rushing at the mo so light on links in this post - sorry...) that makes use of the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/books/">Google books viewabilty API</a> (that is, an easy way to look up whether a book is on Google Books, and how much of the content is viewable; I really want to see "bookstraction" - a mapstraction-like library equivalent - that would do the same across Live book search and Amazon search inside too, but then, I'm just greedy ;-)<br />
   <br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2332373797/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2096/2332373797_8e2daa5782.jpg" alt="2008-03-14_1345" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="275" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The OU library web page looks almost the same of course, though we have a single click through link the O'Reilly Safari page... err, only we don't, if you search for the book on Voyager (I though we could access *all* the O'Reilly books?). And the OU Voyager library catalogue pages look truly horrible...</p>

<p>[Arrghhh, I better stop that line now because I promised myself I'd try to stop bashing the OU library for a bit (I've posted a few ranty emails lately, which maybe I shouldn't, so I'll stop now before mentioning the user authentication security hole (that works on my machine at least) that means I can expose all the OU Library's licensed content that's available via Onesearch on a public access machine, even when I log out of SAMS... oops!)  *SEE PS UPDATE BELOW]</p>

<p>There's also the <a href="http://www.google.com/uds/solutions/bookbar/index.html">Google Books Bookbar</a>, "that lets you easily add a strip of Book Search Results to your web page or blog" and that looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2332413937/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2399/2332413937_7dce196df6.jpg" width="356" height="120" alt="2008-03-14_1412" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>That said, I think where the books you're going to get are unknown/delivered 'live' into the page, I'd prefer one of the context sensitive <a href="https://widgets.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon widgets</a>, like the "content links" or "self-optimising links"? (Hmmm, that might be interesting on a course page....?;-)</p>

<p>Oh, for a free hour or two...</p>

<p>PS UPDATE  - when I mentioned I was maybe going to post about the authentication thing, I was asked to consider putting up a mitigating statement alongside, from the OU library; whilst this isn't the full ranty post about the library authentication flaw I think I found (and notified the library about several days ago) I just got the mitigating statement in an email, so I might as well post it... </p>

<p><em>"Our aim is to make our resources as easily accessible as possible within the terms and conditions of our licences and we have been doing this successfully for a number of years using standard technologies that all libraries use and OU SAMS."</em></p>

<p>Fair enough... but the library is leaking third party licensed content - still...</p>

<p>I checked onesearch again just now, logging into to SAMS, getting a onesearch cookie lease (presumably - I haven't checked), logging OUT of SAMS (though not from the Onesearch page - they don't use the full OU toolbar that shows login status and provides a logout button...(but see below on that...)). Revisiting the onesearch page without the SAMs single sign on authentication  cookie (I'm logged out, remmeber) and I go go straight to onesearch, search for content, view full text licensed content, no worries. Checking any other 'behind SAMS' site prompts me with the single sign on/SAMS login page. I am logged out. Well and truly, according to SAMS. But it seems that I still have a onesearch lease... I suspect that the onesearch lease is set based on originally checking against SAMS, but when the SAMS authentication is revoked by logging out, the onesearch lease is still good...?</p>

<p>There was another sentence in the mitigating statement that I guess I also have to mention now:</p>

<p>The OU library <em>"will be implementing the standard OU header bar in the next few days. We also need to ask the one-stop search system provider to add this to the interface for one-stop search."</em></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see if I'll still be able to use onesearch with the "Sign In"  prompt showing in the toolbar that shows I'm not authenticated... ;-)</p>

<p>PPS mitigating statement on my part - I wasn't going to post this stuff in public, but the arrival of the mitigating statement in my mailbox just in case sort of forced the issue.  I'm not that comfortable with it though... E.g. one thing I'm concerned about is that I may be in breach of the computing code of conduct by publicly posting a flaw in OU systems authentication? In my defence, I informed the Library several days ago, and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010498.html">experience shows</a> that to get a fix effected often requires going public... but the fix then comes quickly... so do I post this PS?,don't  I?, do I?, don't I?, do<br />

<p>Buoyed up with Yahoo's announcement that their going to starting indexing various microformats (e.g. on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/13/yahoo-embraces-the-semantic-web-expect-the-web-to-organize-itself-in-a-hurry/">TechCrunch</a>, on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_supports_semantic_web.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, and in the OU, on <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/?p=237">OpenAir</a> of all places!), I wondered whether that meant they're going to index Microsoft's suggested <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/webslices.mspx">WebSlices</a> (<A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc196992(VS.85).aspx">more documentation</a>), which as far as I can tell are snippets of changeable HTML content in a <span style="font-style: italic;">div</span> element, with an associated <span style="font-style: italic;">rel</span> declared RSS feed that contains a single content item that corresponds to the content of the HTML <span style="font-style: italic;">div</span>, all wrapped up as a microformat (well they do call it <span style="font-style: italic;">hslice</span>!)?<br />
<blockquote>[Y]ou can specify a different source that clients should get updates from. If your Web page has a lot of content that is unrelated to a WebSlice, you can redirect clients to subscribe to an RSS feed. The alternative feed contains a single feed item with all of the same properties as the WebSlice. </p>

<p>Feed URL <br />
- Optional. <br />
- Uses rel name feedurl. <br />
- Represents the alternative feed to which clients should subscribe for updates. <br />
- The URL of the alternative feed is specified as the value of the ref attribute. </p>

<p><tt>&lt;div class="hslice" id="1"&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&lt;p class="entry-title"&gt;Item - $66.00&lt;/p&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;high bidder: buyer1 <br />
&nbsp; ... <br />
&nbsp;&lt;a rel="feedurl"ref="auction.microsoft.com/item.xml"&gt;Subscribe to WebSlice&lt;/a&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; <br />
&lt;/div&gt; </tt></p>

<p>The referenced feed should be a single-item feed. The feed item represents the WebSlice. Use the <strong>mon</strong> namespace if you want to specify the expiration (endtime) for the WebSlice, as shown in green. </p>

<p><tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; <br />
&lt;rss&nbsp; version="2.0"xmlns:mon="http://www.microsoft.com/schemas/rss/monitoring/2007"&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&lt;channel&gt; <br />
&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;Feed for Item&lt;/title&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;link&gt;http://auction.microsoft.com&lt;/link&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;description&gt;Feed for auction item&lt;/description&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ttl&gt;15&lt;/ttl&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;item&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;Item = $66.00&lt;/title&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;link&gt;http://auction.microsoft.com/item#1&lt;/link&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;description&gt;high bidder: buyer1 ...&lt;/description&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mon:endtime&gt;2008-02-28T17:00:00&lt;/mon:endtime&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/item&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;/channel&gt; <br />
&lt;/rss&gt;</tt></blockquote>If I had *any* time at all, here's what comes to mind... A Greasemonkey script that:</p>

<p>1) searches for <span style="font-style: italic;">hslice</span> class attributes;<br />
2) grabs the feed;<br />
3) adds some icon or other...<br />
4) clicking on the icon lets you subscribe to that feed in Netvibes, iGoogle, etc etc. A webslice equivalent of <a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a>, I guess?<br />
5) to provide a subscription widget target, I guess Id also have to create trivial feed displaying widgets that can cope with the single <span style="font-style: italic;">hslice</span> RSS feed item.</p>

<p>Ever the optimist, I reckon 10mins to half an our for each item in the list, to get a bare minimum proof of concept working, not much longer to tidy it up a little...;-) </p>

<p>But you know what, I donlt even have the 2 mins it'd take to dig out my <span style="font-style: italic;">findItemsByClass</span> function, locate a few <span style="font-style: italic;">hslice</span> test pages, and check that bit works :-(</p>

<p>If you get it working, let me know - you'll get tonnes of traffic...or none at all...</p>

<p>PS sort of on topic, here are <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2008/03/11/webslices-and-activities-ported-to-firefox/">a couple of Firefox extensions</a> off the web that implement <em>Activities</em> and <em>WebSlices</em><br />

(At the moment, I'm working on pulling landing pages for maps mashups together: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/maps/">OUseful Map Mashups, Geo Tools and Map Utilities</a>)</p>

<p>For anyone who's in MK, err, next Thursday, here's the meeting announcement:<br />
<blockquote><em>The March EATING talk will take place next week on Thursday 20 March at 2.30 p.m. in the ICT Library (Venables N1015). Please do come along to it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tony Hirst - Mashup madness 101 - getting started with web mashups</strong></p>

<p>If you've heard of 'web mashups', but don't know what they are, exactly...</p>

<p>...or if you have an idea of what they are, but don't know how to get started creating your own web mashups...</p>

<p>...then this EATING meeting might be just what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Starting off with a quick tour of just what constitutes a web mashup, from Nestoria housing maps to feedlearner.com, we'll move on to tinkering with the quick-to-get started Yahoo Pipes mashup tool, before looking at how web APIs are opening up the possibility for production strength mashups using third party web services.</p>

<p>The session will be run in part as a partial attention format workshop, so feel free to bring a wireless laptop along so you can join in the fun. If the hands-on approach doesn't appeal, come along anyway - the meeting will double up as a trad, "talk from the front and read from the projector screen" seminar too...</blockquote></p>

<p>I'll also be doing a couple of papers at the OU Making Conenctions/Curriculum conf (unless I can someone else to do them;-) MK, 29th-30th April:</p>

<p>Here are the abstracts before I lose them:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Course Analytics - Using Google Analytics to Understand Student Behaviour in an Online Course</strong>

<p>Academic Analytics "describes how data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling". Academic Analytics can be used to predict student success, as well as retention, and are the likely focus of the Moodle/VLE activity stats module.</p>

<p>In contrast to indvidual student tracking using academic analytics approaches, course analytics describes an approach whereby an off the shelf web stats analytics tool such as Google Analytics is used to better understand aggregated student behaviour in an online course. By treating the online course materials as 'just another website', powerful reporting techniques developed for use in commercial websites can be used to analyse the effectiveness of the website, as a website,  in terms of measuring stuedent progress through, and engagement with, the online materials.</p>

<p>Using the 2007J presentation of the online Relevant Knowladge course T184 as an example, I will show what sorts of reporting is possible using Google Analytics and discuss how it can be used to inform the design of our online courses.</p>

<p><em>Quality eLearning strand</em></blockquote></p>

<blockquote><strong>Do You Wanna Be My Study Buddy? The OU Course Profiles Facebook Application</strong>

<p>Many OU conference moderators know that many of our students proudly state the course codes of courses they have taken, are taking and intend to take in the signature area of their First Class conference postings. Drawing on this observation, a Facebook application was developed that allowed students to add a list of OU course codes to their Facebook profile page.</p>

<p>Since its launch in October 2008, the OU Course Profiles application has now (March 2008) grown to embrace over 4,250 users.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we will describe Course Profiles, showing how it can be used to help users find study buddies on their course, as well as encouraging them to try out taster material for courses they are considering studying via OpenLearn.</p>

<p>User data allows us to monitor which courses have a particularly high level of activity within the application. By identifying clusters of courses that have been taken by students who have installed the application, we have been able to provide a 'people who studied this course also studied that course' style recommendation service.</p>

<p>As ever more people participate in online social networks, the Course Profiles application allows us to explore non-intrusive ways of engaging with the student body in the places where they choose to go (e.g. Facebook), as well as developing a better understanding of how social network approaches might be used to enhance the student experience and sense of community within OU hosted online environments.  </p>

<p><em>Changing student experience strand</em></blockquote></p>

<p><br />
ps I think I was trying to sort out an ALT w/s, too - oops - better brave my email box, gulp....</p>

<p>pps I'm starting to think we should open source the course profiles fb app code - if we did, would anyone out there want to run with it?<br />

<!--
<p>More than a few people I know around the OU are quite taken by the idea of OUr students generating some of our course content.</p>

<p>Some courses already do this to a greater of lesser extent (over and above the provision of course forums/conferenes, where students can create and engage in course material prompted, as well as their own, discussion activities!)</p>

<p>For example:<br />
<ul><li>T189, the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">digital photography course</a>, requires student to regularly submit photos to a course gallery, and comment/critique other students' photos. The end of course assessment is laregly based on students critiquing a small sample of their own photos that they have uploaded during the course. (Internal readers can read more detail here: <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/t151dev/?p=12">Course Productivity - Student Uploaded Content in T189</a>)</li><br />
<li>An experimental course currently being run from the computing department is exploring the a model in which students create course materials that might serve as draft materials for future courses.</li><br />
<li>T175 <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t175">"Networked living: exploring information and communication technologies"</a> is exploring the use of user-submitted newsand 'course related items' links ) - <a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/wordpress/?s=foundit">fOUndit</a>.</li></ul><br />
and so on.</p>

<p>Quite a few course teams have discussed the possibility of running student maintained course glossaries, and maybe even FAQs/GOTCHA lists, but I'm not sure whether any have actually started to run with that approach...</p>

<p>...and elsewhere, I'm sure I've read stories of educators giving credit to students who manage to get a stable contribution made to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Anyway, over on the <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com">Digital Worlds blogged uncourse experiment</a> blog, I've just posted the following...<br />
<blockquote>I was going to give a brief history of games, here, but instead I'd like to try out a little game... ;-)</p>

<p>I've set up a timeline at <a href="http://xtimeline.com/timeline/History-of-Games">xTimeline: History of games</a>. </p>

<p>Anyone is free to add to the timeline once they are registered with <a href="http://xtimeline.com/">xTimeline</a> and added to the "editorial team". (If you add your xtimeline name as a comment to this post, I'll add you...)</p>

<p>The game is very simple:</p>

<p><strong>Rules of the "<em>History of Games</em> Timeline(wiki) Game"&#65533;</strong><br />
<ul><li>I have seeded the timeline with scant details of three games and the periods they are thought to date from.</li><li>The game is time limited and runs from the date stamp of this post for fourteen days.</li><li>The game proceeds by players committing sets of entries to the timeline.</li><li>You may make one set of entries to the timeline per clock hour, but make as many sets of entries as you like given that constraint for the duration of the game.</li><li>A set of entries is defined as follows: Pick one game from the games listed on the timeline, and enter two other games: one that dates from a period after the game you chose, another that first appeared before it.</li><li>Furthermore, the two games you add to the timeline must not be more recent than the most recent game in the timeline, nor should they be older.</li><li>You may optionally add a third game to the list that is either more recent than the most recent game, or older than the oldest game.</li><li>You may challenge as many other games as you like if you think the date, name, "creator", location, or description given they have given for a game is in error; I am assuming that you *can* edit the details to what you believe are the correct ones.</li><li>Points will be awarded for each entry you make, and each correction you make, and deducted for each change that is made to one of your entries.</li><li>All rules are subject to change, and I may make arbitrary or incorrect rulings against them!</li><li>If you would like to suggest rule changes or modifications to the Timeline(wiki) game (this is a first attempt after all!), please post a comment...</li></ul> </blockquote><br />
As a model, who knows whether it'll work! (I'm not sure there are enough active followers of Digital Worlds to make it fly, but maybe one or two dedicated souls will join in?)</p>

<p>But the point is sort of this: we <em>don't necessarily know</em> how to make a go of soliciting and exploiting student submitted content online, and we don't necessarily have the learning design patterns and example use cases to guide us (or do we, Grainne?), but without <em>experimenting</em> with all manner of techniques, how are we going to figure this stuff out?</p>

<p>I'd argue the above game is an introductory info skills exercise - fact finding, summarising, and maybe error checking other people's claims. It also maybe acts as an enrichment exercise - providing participants with the opportunity to get a wider view of what games there are then I've mentioned in the Digital Worlds blog.</p>

<p>Lecturers in trad universities can try stuff out in a single lecture - if it doesn't fly, not a lot is lost. But where OU courses take 1-2 years to put together, and present once a year with fixed materials, running a dud exercise in the first full presentation of a course doesn't necessarily help us figure out how to do it properly?</p>

<p>Is that maybe one more reason to be trying this experiment out?</p>

<p>Anyway, the *real* reason for posting this was to solicit feedbcak on the game rules I sketched out above - can they be obviously gamed, or exploited against the spirit of the game?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>One of the stumbling blocks I've come up against with Wordpress is the inability to embed Grazr widgets, or even better, javascript, in the body of a post using the hosted Wordpress servce.</p>

<p>One short term workaround is to embed an image representation of the feed, e.g. using the <a href="http://www.rss2image.com/">RSS2image</a> service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rss2image.com/feed/291"><img src="http://www.rss2image.com/image/291/image.png" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>It strikes me that I've explored workarounds to this before, way back when, for example in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007429.html">They Stole OUr Learning Environment - Now We're Stealing It Back</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009239.html">Adding a Grazr Widget to a Moodle Journal Page</a></p>

<p>In those cases, the trick was to use a Greasmonkey script - or a bookmarklet - to scan the page for a particular HTML element ID and then inject a widget into the page at that location.</p>

<p>By parsing the contents of an element - for example, extracting the URL pointed to from a link via the element's href attribute - the injected widget/code can re-present the content.</p>

<p>In the above RSS2image case, it would be possible to pull out the feed URL from the link that encloses the image, and replace the image with the embedded live feed.</p>

<p>(It would be easier for tinkering if the rss2image service actually allowed you to call an image by feed url - e.g. <em>http://rss2image.com?url=http://feed.example.com/foo/bar</em> It would also be handy if you could control the size of the image, and maybe a little bit more of what's displayed? A version for twitter would accept the full character limit, and a version for delicious might display the link title, description, and a tiinyurl reference to the bookmarked page itself?*)</p>

<p>The problem remains, though, that this is a <em>client side</em> fix, and so beyond what's appropriate for the majority of users.</p>

<p>*picking up on that, I wonder if this library offers a quick way in to such a tool? <a href="http://www.webvideodoctor.com/web-video-tips/how-to-embed-your-twitter-status-in-you-ustream/">How to Embed Your Twitter Status in You Ustream</a>, which links to a PHP library that egnerates an image from a twitter stream...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/greasemonkey" rel="tag">greasemonkey</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bookmarklet" rel="tag">bookmarklet</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20wordpress" rel="tag"> wordpress</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

Enter the a public Google Calendar ID and generate URL for just the calendar map, or a side-by-side calendar <em>and</em> map view.</p>

<p>I've also added a feature that will generate an iframe embed code, to make it a little easier to embed these views in your own pages.</p>

<p>Using a hosted Wordpress installation has felt rather more constraining than I thought it would, though. I opted for the hosted version:</p>

<p>a) because it's available to anyone; and<br />
b) it strips out Javascript and the majority of embed codes - as do many VLEs (though I think the OU's Moodle VLE is opening up a little?) This means I can't do anything too crazy... ;-)</p>

<p>Whilst I can embed Youtube movies, and Splashcast players, I can't embed Grazr widgets or flickr slideshows in a post, which is a shame...</p>

<p>There are a few sidebar widgets I may be able to go with, and I've just added Box.net to see whether that will provide a way of supporting filesahring across readers of the blog.</p>

<p>The decision to go with using Game Maker as the environment for hands-on game building has hit the obstacle I thought it might: it's Windows only, and at least one of the people reading so far has a Mac. The reason I opted for Game Maker is that it offers a very structured environment, and is well suited to the construction of recognisable arcade style games. The structure of the interface also maps neatly on to the different component types used in creating Game Maker games - rooms, objects, sprites and so on - which I'm hoping will provide a neat way in to discussing some of the software issues relating to game creation.</p>

<p>The alternative package I'd considered was MIT's Scratch, which is arguably more open-ended ion terms of interactive media design. I hope to get on to that in a few week's time...</p>

<p>The format of the blogged uncourse is loosely based on the structure of the OU Relevant Knowledge short course programme courses, which deliver approximatley 20-30 one to three scroll pages of content per week. The content I've posted so far is probably a little down on this - but then, any possible readers out there probably don't want to give up a nominal 10 hours per week following hte blog (which is the time commitment required on an RK short course).</p>

<p>I've tried to close each post with a question, which has inspired some commenting. I've tried to weave some of the comments into following posts, and I'm going to try to be sensitive to letting comments guide - or at least influence - some of the content that I post.</p>

<p>Writing the blog outside the OU has freed up the way I link to resources, and embed movies (no need for rights clearance!). </p>

<p>In the post on checking book references online (an aside to the main theme of the course, excpet insofar as it referes to interactive, online book readers!) I discussed several ways of linking out to book content on Google books, Live booksearch and Amazon Search Inside.</p>

<p>A comment to one of the posts actually referenced a table in a particular book that I was able to direct people to: <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/so-what-is-a-game/#comment-24">viewing books via Live booksearch</a>.<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/uncourse" rel="tag">uncourse</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Geocoding Multiple Google Calendar Feeds</h3>

<!--
<p>I got an email the other asking how to display several geocoded Google Calendar feeds on the same map using the pipe I've written about before (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012594.html">Displaying Google Calendars on a Google Map</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013608.html">maps and calendars side by side</a>).</p>

<p>The easiest way is possibly to just modify the pipe by merging several separate feeds - this should give the idea:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2316878363/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2316878363_6788b3d1e6.jpg" alt="2008-03-07_2344" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="268" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>A more elegant way, perhaps, is to specify each of the calendar feeds in an OPML file, and pass this to a pipe that merges all the items from the RSS feeds specified in the OPML feed (<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=foG8NYns3BGtuMxP6kjTQA">Feed Merge from OPML then Geocode Pipe</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2317680092/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/2317680092_95a0b0d666.jpg" alt="2008-03-07_2339" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="269" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>One of the easiest ways of creating an OPML feed is to create a Grazr OPML reading list - that's what I use in the demo.</p>

<p>On the to do list is to build a little form based interface to plot a map when given an appropriate OPML url, ideally using the <a href="http://www.mapstraction.com/">mapstraction</a> library, (so that I can use Yahoo and Live maps, as well as (i.e. instead of) Google maps).</p>

<p>But I've way too much on for the next week or so to be likely to find to do that before Easter :-(<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gcalmap" rel="tag">gcalmap</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google%20calendar" rel="tag">google calendar</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20google%20map" rel="tag"> google map</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mapstraction" rel="tag"> mapstraction</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Local Facebook Apps for Local People... How many Users?</h3>

<!--
<p>In preparing the Higher Ed Experts talk I gave today, I started thinking about the size, scope and likely audience of our <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=%22OU%20course%20profiles%20facebook%20app%22">Course Profiles Facebook app</a>, compared to an app designed "to attract the largest number of users as quickly as possible", as was the case with "Kiss Me", another of the apps covered in the <a href="http://www.higheredexperts.com/webinar/en/webinars/?tx_seminars_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=15">Facebook Applications webinar series</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to mention is that Course Profiles was built originally to appeal to current OU students who were already on Facebook. Looking at the OU Facebook Network page today, I noticed there were just over 6,000 members. Since membership of an academic network requires the user to have an email address for that institution, this number - 6,000 or so users - is thus likely to be less than then number of actual OU students who are on Facebook.</p>

<p>Membership of a network is automatic if you have registered on Facebook with a particular email address. Institutions can also set up a public profile page on Facebook that <span style="font-style: italic;">anyone</span> can see and anyone can associate with by becoming a <span style="font-style: italic;">fan</span> of the page. At the time of writing, just over 5,500 people have fanned the Open University on Facebook. I'm guessing this set overlaps with the membership of the OU network, but is not a subset of it...</p>

<p>Another useful piece of intelligence about people on Facebook who have declared an OU allegiance are the members of the general OU social group. Membership of that group today stands at about 2000.</p>

<p>Even if each of these groups were totally distinct - that is, let's assume members of one are not a member of either of the others<br />
&nbsp;- this would give a population of less than 15,000 people who had declared an allegiance with the OU through one of the three biggest OU forums on Facebook. Course Profiles currently has almost 4,200 users.</p>

<p>The saturation level&nbsp; - that is, the maximum possible uptake - for an application such as Course Profiles is thus a relatively small number of users. For a particular instance of an application designed to support current members of a single institution, your user base is only likely to ever number in the thousands, with two exceptions:</p>

<p>1) an HEI may have a large number of alumni, maybe an order or magnitude larger than your current population; and</p>

<p>2) it may have a large potential audience base (though again, this is likely to max out at less than two orders of magnitude larger than the number of current students in your institution.</p>

<p>(There are exceptions - the Open University raises it's profile through BBC broadcasts, though even with audiences for some programmes numbering in the millions, this is still less than 2 orders of magnitude larger than our current student numbers (approx. 150,000 at the current time)).</p>

<p>The other way of growing Course Profiles numbers would be to offer it to other institutions, growing it in much the same way that Facebook originally took off. We keep talking on and off about how we might make Course Profiles available for use elsewhere, so if you're interested, please get in touch... Just bear one thing in mind - we don't really want to get involved in application support! <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fb" rel="tag">fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20course%20profiles" rel="tag"> course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>This info is doing the rounds - Google experimenting with inline search boxes when you search for a particular URL (which often happens when you type a URL into a Google search by <em>by mistake</em>....</p>

<p>I've been neglecting posts about search for some time, (and <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru/search"><em>del.icio.us/feedthru</em> links on search</a>) so I guess here's an opportunity to make a quick reference to the Yahoo "search monkey" feature that got a heads-up last week...</p>

<p>As searchengineland puts it in <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080226-000100.php">Yahoo To Announce "Search Monkey" Enhanced, Annotated Results At SMX West</a>, "Yahoo plans to unveil a project code-named 'Search Monkey', a set of open-source tools that allow users and publishers to annotate and enhance search results associated with specific web sites".</p>

<p>The service will allow website owners to produce annotations for their search listings, giving a listing that resembles a <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/subscribedlinks/">Google Subscribed Link</a> listing. I was pretty sure Stuart put together one for OpenLearn, but I couldn't find it in a quick search of the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/subscribedlinks/directory/All_categories">Google Subscribed Links directory</a>?</p>

<p>Anyway, Subscribed Links donlt seem to have taken off at all - so what <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> Yahoo thinking?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/open%20university" rel="tag">open university</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20google" rel="tag"> google</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>One of my favourite TV series from several years ago is <em>Yes, Minister</em>, the story of hapless government minister (and later, Prime Minister) James Hacker MP. One of the tricks that SIr Humprey Appleby, his senior civil servant, would use to dissuade Hacker from pursuing a particular decision was to label is as <em>brave</em>, the implication being that it would get Hacker in to trouble, or lose him his seat...</p>

<p>Just yesterday, I got the following <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/03/planning-ahead/#comments">comment</a> over on a new blog I've started: "Good luck with this, I dont think I would have the nerve to do something similar online."</p>

<p>Gulp...</p>

<p>The context is this: <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/">Digital Worlds - Interactive Media and Game Design</a>, "an experiment in the production and delivery of online educational materials"</p>

<p>In short, I'm going to have a go at 'blogging a course', sort of... </p>

<p>The experiment started today - <em>ish</em> - and will hopefully carry on for at least the next 2-3 months. Feel free to tag along, and/or share the URL with anyone you think may be interested ;-) </p>

<p>PS the BBC have popped a few clips from Yes, Minister up on Youtube, though they arenlt available for download. There's even on about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=WW7mhtp5a5E">University funding</em>... ;-)</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote a post - "<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/013699.html">What's Everyone Twittering About?</a>" - that described a basic Twitter feed annotation pipe.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about feed annotation streams, and how they can be used, for so long that of course one of the possible next steps - like the step I didn't post, the step is so blindingly obvious that I didn't need to post it, was the step that no-one got...</p>

<p>Martin summed it up quite neatly: "I think I need a Tony translator..."</p>

<p>(I think I actually need a writing monkey - someone who can write up some of the more interesting doodles and tinkerings that appear on this blog and take the couple of days out each write up would need to get&nbsp; them into journals and conferences and all those other quaint publishing fora that academia seems to value for promotion cases et al. ;-) I'd share the paper credits of course :-)</p>

<p>So - when I posted about the twitter feed annotation pipe, this is one of the things I saw - <span style="font-style: italic;">now I can do this</span>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2306939969/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3094/2306939969_54ed3c3ee8.jpg" alt="2008-03-03_1351" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="435" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Actually, I went away and added a few more things to the pipe - the content analysis terms are now also used to search Youtube and slideshare. Any Youtube results can be viewed inline:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2307747216/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2307747216_a7f003a66f.jpg" alt="2008-03-03_1354" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="438" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I also added the option to view more search results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2306947233/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2111/2306947233_2bfe427950.jpg" alt="2008-03-03_1356" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="270" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Remember, the search terms are the terms that the Yahoo content analysis/term extractor service returns when it is passed the tweet...</p>

<p>If you want to play with it (the page load time is a bit slow - but bear with it), the web app can be found here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/serendipitwitterous/">serendipiTwitterous</a></p>

<p>(The URL has change from the URL I twittered over the weekend - so if you bookmarked that URL, please replace it with the new one: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/serendipitwitterous/</em> or <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/serendipitwitterous/?id=<strong>yourTwitterID</strong></em>)</p>

<p>The pipe can be found here: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ouseful/serendipitwitterous">serendipiTwitterous pipe</a></p>

<p>Just input your twitter id and go... :-)</p>

<p>PS if you click on the id of the sender of a serendipiTweet, it will show you their serendipiTwitterous feed ;-)<br />

<!--
<p>One of the projects I've got myself involved in here as a way of trying to avoid doing any 'real' work (?!;-) is SociaLearn (aka social:learn et al.!), an open platform for supporting formal and informal learning. If you follow Martin Weller's blog, you may already have seen mention of it in this post - <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/02/the-sociallearn.html">The Social:Learn Project</a> - which includes the following overview:</p>

<div style="width: 425px; text-align: left;" id="__ss_271495"><object style="margin: 0px;" height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=sociallearn-introduction-120341000081104-4"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=sociallearn-introduction-120341000081104-4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="355" width="425"></object><div style="font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="SlideShare" /></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mweller/sociallearn-introduction?src=embed" title="View 'Social:Learn Introduction' on SlideShare">View Social:Learn presentation</a></div></div>

<p>Sarah expressed some possible doubt about the project in a post entitled: <a href="http://kindalearning.blogspot.com/2008/02/web-20-may-come-to-ou-before-22nd.html">"Web 2.0 may come to OU before 22nd Century" Shocker!</a>, commenting: "The words sound right, but the fear of actually relinquishing control of absolutely everything connected with learning delivery and all the multitude of 'problems' dreamed up by those vetting it along the way... well... here's hoping that it's not just words and a nice idea."</p>

<p>Well, how does this sound for starters?</p>

<p>Work on the API has already begun - an external development team are scoping it out at the moment over in the US - and the design theme for the site we're gonna get someone else to build around those APIs are already being put together by an external design agency...</p>

<p>...but we all know that's not enough, right? Platforms and APIs only gain traction when people start to play with them, developers as well as users, which is why I'm floating this post...</p>

<p>So - we're looking to see if there are any tinkerers or developers out there who are working for educational institutions (formal or otherwise) or training organisations (public, private or voluntary sector) who'd like to meet up for pizza and and pint in a Barcamp/unconference like setting, and share a story or two about the itches that are bugging you in plugging institutional services together, and the third party systems you'd love to pull into your organisation, whether it's the VLE, your dreams of a PLE, the LMS or the WTF...</p>

<p>Code and wireless will be on tap if you feel the need for a quick hack or tinker, but what we really want to know is what are the components you could use tomorrow in an educational setting. (If you can build them on the day, even better... ;-)</p>

<p>If your institution was Facebook or Google, Twitter or MySpace, Microsoft or Yahoo (or are they the same thing yet?!;-) what APIs would you be publishing, and what would your platform look like?</p>

<p>The event will only happen if there's enough interest, so if you are interested, please mail me - a.j.hirst@open.ac.uk - and maybe even sign up on <a href="http://www.doodle.ch/zye37iw7haz7aa5k">http://www.doodle.ch/zye37iw7haz7aa5k</a> with the dates that are good for you in the second half of March or throughout April (weekends are a possibility too...). We could maybe even try to hook something around the Eduserv Symposium, JISC Conference, or OR08, if that'd be more convenient?</p>

<p>Whilst being run as a skunkworks,and unmanaged as such (insofar as it can be!) this project has some quite serious backing&nbsp; - to the extent that if there's enough interest in North America, we might be able to work a camp day out there too, time allowing. If you're interested, then mail me, and show us when you're free (as above) - here: <a href="http://www.doodle.ch/tsay3nysytniukbq">http://www.doodle.ch/tsay3nysytniukbq</a></p>

<p>That said, I wonder whether there's space in the NMC Spring Symposium for a "tell us what you need and show us what you've got" session? Maybe we could have a camp here over the Symposium dates and hook up?</p>

<p>Interested? Then please get in touch... with me, or <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/">Martin</a>.... or <a href="http://e4innovation.com/">Grainne</a>.... Tag is <span style="font-style: italic;">socialearn</span> (one L) for now (#socialearn on twitter); use it and we should find it...<br />
