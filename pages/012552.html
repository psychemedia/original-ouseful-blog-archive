<h3 class="title">Course Profiles Facebook App Update</h3>

<p>I haven't posted about the <a href="./010855.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook app</a> (did you know it got a <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/12/not-edublog-award-winners.html">Downesy</a>? ;-), although <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=113">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://greenhughes.com/content/course-profiles-application-updated">Liam</a> have been posting updates, whilst <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/01/facebook---the.html">Martin</a> has been calling the demise of Facebook;-) </p>

<p>Anyway, Liam pushed a minor release to our 3,300 or so users last week, (with a major interface redesign on the way sometime soon, hopefully...?!;-)</p>

<p>The first thing to notice from this course profiles panel on Liam's homepage is that Course Profiles now lets users declare an OU qualification code. This was one of the most heavily requested features, so we are listening... :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212611727/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/2212611727_6298708885.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0023" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="226" width="403" /></a></p>

<p>You might also notice a further bit of personalisation on the Profile page display - the ability to set your own Course Profile banner message:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212634489/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/2212634489_6bce839485.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0037" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="56" width="395" /></a></p>

<p>There's also been an addition to the course actions page for each course, in the form of course recommendations based on a "people who studied this course also studied..." principle:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2213434700/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2213434700_eb84e97258.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0040" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="347" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I dabbled with a course recommendation code from the O'Reilly <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21"><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em></a> book before the Christmas break, which seemed to work okay, but I'm not sure what&nbsp; algorithm Liam is using. Now that the functionality is in place, we'll maybe start thinking about how to optimise the algorithm - if we can work out what behaviour we're trying to prompt... (Liam, I'm thinking we maybe need to add a tracking code on the recommendation URLs - e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">&amp;src=A103_ca_rec</span>, or similar?)</p>

<p> It's encouraging to see that users are starting to engage with the course comments wall, too. Looking at the comments for A103, it's interesting to see a range of contributions, from old alumni, recent alumni (2007 presentation) and student's on the course that starts presenting in a week or two.</p>

<p>From chatting to one or two student and AL users of Facebook, the creation of groups for students yet to start a course, and wanting to meet-up with others who are also about to start the same course, is desirable (for some students). So it'll be interesting to see if the Find a Study Buddy utility gets much use over the next week or two, with the start of many courses due at the beginning of February.</p>

<p>One thing I hope to do over the next day or two is produce a report of Course Profiles activity for the course team of one of the more popular (and active) courses declared within the app, using both Course Profiles data (e.g. as shown <a href="./012240.html">here</a>) and Google Analytics data, which we've been collecting for a while, but have only recently started looking at in any detail.</p>

<p>As with looking at Course Analytics, identifying sensible goals is an issue, but for starters I'm going with the course actions page (shown above) as well as clicks through to the comment wall and find a study buddy.</p>

<p>The OU web stats people are tracking clicks through to Openlearn materials for us, too, so all in all, we should have enough data to tell an interesting tale or two - and hopefully pick up a few clues about how the app is being used, and how we might improve it :-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20profiles" rel="tag">course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>So what proportion of FB users who are registered OU students use the app?<br />

<p>We have no way of answering that question - we don't attempt to reconcile app and OU backend systems, student identities etc etc in any way at all...</p>

<p>Nor do we know whether people are legitimately declaring courses...</p>

<p>OK, so any way of cross-checking the accuracy of the data?</p>

<p>"OK, so any way of cross-checking the accuracy of the data?"</p>

<p>Not withthe app as we have designed it -= but that is deliberate ( ./011606.html )</p>

<p>We made a design decision NOT to integrate at all with OU systems, and to create an app that could in principle be built by anyone outside the OU.</p>

<p>I have started mulling over how we could produce a 'corporate'  version of course profiles and what systems it might plug into, mainly as a thought exercise to identify what internal web services might be useful if we were to call on them in a loosely coupled way from the app backend.</p>

<p>A couple of obvious services are:<br />
- xcri server for course info;<br />
- some authenticated service that provides details of a qualification/award held by a specific person;<br />
- maybe a tie-in to course level info, eg course result status for completed course</p>

<p>Then there's in presentation course info - links to course calendar, current study tiopic, forthcoming tutorial dates etc (ie stuff that i saw being exposed in a mobile way ages ago: ./007342.html ) </p>
