<h3 class="title">OU Blogger Listings</h3>

<p>After putting a call out to anyone who blogged on the OU intranet, I've had a few more returns from people who blog for all sorts of reasons (more on that in a later post, perhaps).</p>

<p>There are quite a few private blogs (study diaries, for example), some public blog pages without RSS feeds, many blogs without comments and so on, but there are a few <em>trad blogs</em> too...</p>

<p>Anyway - here's what I propose to keep up to date...</p>

<p><hr /><br />
A list of OU public blog pages, saved at the moment on my del.icio.us list with tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/OUblogger"><em>OUblogger</em></a>:</p>

<p>**I've pulled the script include because del.icio.us is misbehaving - again; I'll set up a Simpy feed instead when I get a chance to move the bookmarks over...</p>

<p><em>How can I  include this [a listing from del.icio.us] in my own web pages?</em></p>

<p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/psychemedia/oublogger?title=OU%20Bloggers;icon=rss;sort=alpha"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p><hr /><br />
A <strong>blogroll</strong> of blogs with public RSS feeds on my <a href="http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?html=1&id=psychemedia&folder=OU%20Bloggers">Bloglines account</a>:</p>

<p><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?id=psychemedia&folder=OU Bloggers"></script></p>

<p><em>How can I  include this in my own web pages?</em></p>

<p>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?id=psychemedia&folder=OU Bloggers"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p><hr /><br />
An <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouBloggersRSS.opml">OPML file</a> of the RSS blogroll.<br />

<h3 class="title">OUseful Feed Now Available from Feedburner</h3>

<p>As this blog is hosted on an old, generic OU blogserver (one set up, in fact, some time ago for students on particular courses), and may be replaced as we move to our new, Moodled VLE, I'd like to encourage any readers to move their subscription to this blog over to my new Feedburner feed: <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner</a></p>

<p>Feedburner offers a few added value services too (like its <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedflare">Feedflare</a> extensions, which add <em>Email this</em> and <em>Add to del.icio.us</em> links, for example).</p>

<p>There's also the option to mix in a daily summary of <a href="http://del.icio.uc/psychemedia">my del.icio.us posts</a>, which I'll look at...</p>

<p>However, as my posts there can be v eclectic at times, I'll perhaps see if I can just mix in summaries of posts tagged in a particular way (<em>ouseful</em> perhaps...)</p>

<p>So - if you do subscribe to this blog via the unwieldy <em>blogs.open.ac.uk etc</em> feed, please consider moving the subscription to <a title="OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Info - powered by FeedBurner</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful" title="Subscribe to my feed, OUseful Info" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon16x16.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<h3 class="title">More on Possible Outlets for OU Blogging...</h3>

<p>Dutiful employee that I am, the homepages of my various browsers tend to be either the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> site (when, oh, when are they going to make an RSS feed of future programming available...?!) or the Intranet default/home page:</p>

<p><img alt="intranetFronPage.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/intranetFronPage.JPG" width="796" height="564" border="0" /></p>

<p>The one thing that I really don't like about the Intranet page, however, is the presence of classified ads...</p>

<p>How much nicer it would be if I could replace this box with one entitled 'OU Bloggers' that posted the titles of - and links to - recent blog posts made by OU people who blog...</p>

<p>PS I've also set up an <em>OU Bloggers</em> blogroll on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, although I have to admit I made a couple of the blogs private, either because they look more internally oriented than public blogs, because they appear to have lapsed, or because there isn't an RSS feed...)</p>

<p>Just because, here's a test link from the Blogroll associated with my <em>OU Blogger</em> folder...</p>

<p><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?id=psychemedia&folder=OU Bloggers"></script></p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's possible to get and aggregated feed from a blogroll, or an OPML file of the (public) blogs included in the blogroll, but I'll go have a look round Bloglines when I get a chance... </p>

<p>PPS [DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS - THIS FEED WILL DATE REALLY QUICKLY - I'M WORKING ON AN ALTERNATIVE...] here's a place you can subscribe to an <a href="http://feedblendr.com/subscribe/48">aggregated, river of news feed from my list of OU Bloggers</a> (here's the actual feed as <a href="http://feedblendr.com/rss/48">RSS</a> or <a href="http://feedblendr.com/atom/48">Atom</a>) (courtesy of <a href="http://feedblendr.com/">FEEDblendr</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Distributing Bespoke Browsers</h3>

<p>In a recent post <a title="Lorcan Dempsey's weblog: Distance from the default: Web browser extensions" href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000924.html">Distance from the default: Web browser extensions</a>, Lorcan Dempsey wonders about what detrimental effects on the uptake of additional functionality in a browser etc. result from the effort needed to install the extension.</p>

<p>I'd actually mashed this thought with another - the usability of bespoke interface devices for high performance tasks - in a potential post I'd been doodling offline a couple of days ago...</p>

<p>So given the apparent synchronicity, here's that doodle...</p>

<p><h3>Is There a Place for a Library Equivalent of the Flock Browser</h3></p>

<p>In October last year, following weeks of hype and speculation, the <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock browser</a> – a major reworking of Firefox customised to support social networking activities such as blogging and social bookmarking – was launched to limited success. In this post, I'd like to explore whether there is the potential for a customised browser for use on public access terminals in libraries across the world?</p>

<p>Many have argued that the functionality offered by Flock is available to users of Firefox in the form of extensions, that can provide additional functionality, and customised skins that can transform the visual presentation of the browser. Members of the Flock camp do not deny these claims, although they seek to rise above them arguing (rightly, I think) that most users are not willing to install extensions or customise the appearance of their browser. (However, it must be said also that such users are perhaps unlikely to use anything other than the most widely used browsers, indeed are perhaps unlikely to use anything other than Internet Explorer with its default settings (except perhaps for customising the homepage, and being tricked into installing toolbars from the major search engines whilst installing other pieces of software!).</p>

<p>What came to mind last night was the idea that perhaps there is a role for a browser 'sponsored' by the library sector (libraries, ILS(??) vendors and so on) for use on public access computers in libraries.</p>

<p>Why? Another part of the jigsaw was a podcast I listened to on my commute to work this morning, from Bran Ferren at <a href="http://appliedminds.com/">Applied Minds?</a> on user interfaces (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail852.html">IT conversations, web2.0</a>). His argument was that most user interfaces for complex/high performance human tasks are in fact complicated, custom interfaces, rather than generic interfaces.</p>

<p>Now – access to the library catalogues is increasingly provided within libraries using the same web based interface that users can access over the web. This is a good and a bad thing. Good – because users can gain confidence in using the interface within library and can then use it comfortably at home, or work. Bad, because this interface is generic in the sense that it is (often) quite a basic web page rather than a customised application.</p>

<p>The rise of AJAX technologies has enabled the creation of rich interface applications within a browser that look a lot like real clients that you might otherwise find on the desktop, but the library interfaces I have seen to date are not that rich.</p>

<p>Why should libraries use a browser based catalogue interface rather than a custom client that has been designed for the purpose of effectively accessing library services? There is no way we should expect a user to have to install an application on their machine to access library web services (which is why protocols such as Z39.50 are so painful to mash compared to RESTfully defined XML based web services!) but why can't we have these powerful tools to support high performance tasks in the physical library context. After all, if searching library information systems isn't a high performance task, why are information professionals so defensive about providing Google style search interfaces to their users?</p>

<p>This is where a customised browser might come in – it can provide high levels of functionality embedded in the browser. Similar functionality can be provided through the provision of extensions to a user's browser. If a user can be educated to use the extended library browser, and they perceive the value of the extended functionality it provides, they can be shown how to achieve similar levels of functionality in their browsers at home.</p>

<p>Even if a fully fledged customised browser (a la Flock) isn't adopted, then customised browsers with a suite of extensions and added search functionality (such as ) can easily be provided in library foyers. Users might be encouraged to try out such enhanced/extended/customised browsers for themselves by borrowing USB memory drives with portable, customised browsers preloaded on to them (this is perhaps another area where libraries might support wider training functions within an organisation – loaning out software applications in a portable format to users so they can try them out without having to install the software on their own machine).</p>

<p>Libraries could also host web pages containing useful extensions, pre-customised browsers for download etc. </p>

<h3 class="title">My Curriculum Conference Presentation</h3>

<p>As promised, here's a link to the presentation I gave at the recent OU Curriculum conference:</p>

<p><em>OU Curriculum Conference: Curriculum innovation across boundaries Jan 17-18, 2006.</em></p>

<p><strong>Course in progress: involving students in real-time course production</strong><br />
<em>Tony Hirst, Ches Lincoln & Chris Bird</em></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
In December 2005, the Faculty of Technology launched two online discussion based study groups on behalf of the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY) covering the topics 'Robotics' and 'Design for the Web'.<br />
The aim of the discussion groups is to expose high achieving schoolchildren aged 14-18 to HE course materials and undergraduate level academic discussion on a range of relevant topics (one or two per month).<br />
The discussion environment we are using is First Class, with a customised web based interface, closely coupled to samples of web page based OU course materials taken from the Technology Short Course Programme courses T183 and T184.<br />
Rather than work to a fully predetermined curriculum, we aim to be responsive to the interests of the participants.  Consequently, we are developing a model whereby users can influence the choice of discussion topics by their suggestions in a special Crucible conference. Popular topics can then be 'bubbled up' as full blown 'timetabled' discussion topics in to the full Study Group work areas.<br />
This approach tends towards a student-led topic selection model, mediated by the group moderators, that allows topics to covered to a depth useful and appropriate to the needs of the group's members.<br />
Personal reflection is supported by the provision of a personal learning journal, which participants can use to reflect on their own personal learning journey through each discussion topic.</p>

<p><strong>Biographies</strong><br />
Tony Hirst – Lecturer, Dept. of ICT, Co-convenor Robotics Outreach Group, fundholder OU/NAGTY online Academic Study Groups project<br />
Ches Lincoln – Phoenix/FirstClass System Administrator, Faculty of Technology<br />
Chris Bird – Associate Lecturer, Technology Short Course Programme FirstClass conference moderator </p>

<p>The presentation is annotated, in places, with comprehesive notes (that get cut off in occasion o the PDF - anyone know how to fix this?)</p>

<p>PS for those with access to the OU intranet, there is now a <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/curriculum-conference-2006/">Curriculum Conference website</a> with copies of keynotes, individual presentations etc.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: a <a href="http://curconf.open.ac.uk/moodle/index.php">discussion area to support the conference</a> was set up after the fact (March 17th) on one of the many Moofle installations that the OU has around the campus now! Since the initial announcement post, there have been - err - no postings... Hmmm....</p>

<h3 class="title">Blogging in the OU...</h3>

<p>I think that over the last couple of days, institutional blogging has been encouraged by our <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/vco/p3_1.asp">VC</a>....</p>

<p>The setting was a two day internal conference at the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">OU</a> on <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/pvc-ca/p6.shtml">Curriculum Innovation Across Boundaries</a> (I couldn't find a public link so if you are outside the OU firewall, I apologise...) Although I missed the VC's keynote (I'm hoping it will be made available as a <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">webcast replay</a> - OU internal again, I'm afraid...), I did catch her comments at the closing event; and unless I completely misunderstood her message, I think there was, in part, a call to arms with respect to institutional blogging. </p>

<p>Now, I don't know if the the call-to-blogging referred to internal blogs (two of which are claimed on <a href="http://tutors.open.ac.uk/">this tutor site</a>, though neither are blogs really in any sense other than they are easy news publishing sites with comment support), or public blogs (such as this one), but I think in general that this could be a Good Thing. </p>

<p>The Conference covered 4 main areas - errr.... I think I can blog these without giving too much away. As everything else to do with the conference is Intranetted, though, I'm not sure how much I can say... there is, as far as I know, no institutional blogging policy yet to cover my blogging behaviour, except perhaps general guidelines in my <a hef="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/human-resources/information/terms-conditions/acr1.doc">Terms and Conditions</a> (err, can I give away intranetted URLs on a public page???), or the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/university-documents/computing-code-of-conduct.htm">Computing Code of Conduct</a>... Hmm - perhaps I should read them before going any further....</p>

<p>...or perhaps not... (Do you ever get one of those reckless moments...? ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, the Conference covered 4 main areas - Working across boundaries, Research and Curriculum Initiatives, Blue skies thinking: the Curriculum portfolio - 2010, Matching Curriculum to teaching technologies.</p>

<p>One of the most notable things about the Conference for me was the majority of things that were reported (and there were 4 parallel sessions running 3 or 4 times a day) were new to most people. This meant there was a lot of good feeling about all the neat stuff that's going on here, as well as a lot of networking between people who wanted to make use of each others' stuff (in the technology led themes, at least) which people didn't know existed before the conference...)</p>

<p>And that's where I'm a bit concerned... lots of people were asking questions in sessions along the lines of "that thing you did/are doing is really neat. Would it be possible for us to do something similar/use that approach/software in our course?"</p>

<p>Which means that our internal comms, by and large, are typically broken on an everyday basis... (I knew that anyway - I'm sure it's the same in any large organisation... you know the story - you have to go to an international conference half way round the world to find people from your own institution who have similar interests!)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how it would work, though - I spend a lot of midnight oil blogging, and I don't tend to touch on a lot of the 'pedagogical' stuff I could, such as the presentation I gave at the conference on a project we are running with <a href="http://www.nagty.ac.uk/">NAGTY</a> (the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth) involving a couple of <a href"http://nagty.open.ac.uk/">online academic study groups</a> (I'll will actually blog about that -along with a copy of the presentation, when I next have a spare hour; I just wish I had recorded the talk then I could have started to podcast too!;-)</p>

<p>One area where it would seem to make sense is in the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/ou/p9.shtml">CETLs</a>, particularly the <a href="http://cetl.open.ac.uk/opencetl/">Open CETL</a>.<br />
<blockquote>The Open CETL is a collaboration between the OU’s three single-institution  Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning and the collaborative Centre which it leads. The Centres will shortly share the Open CETL Suite. They are already working together to avoid overlaps, share good practice and achieve efficiencies. The Open CETL is not then, a distinct set of staff, nor a formal organisation; rather, it is a way of working and sharing.</blockquote></p>

<p>Furthermore, each centre has simalar interests and objectives, including this one ( number three on a list of four): <em>"Each is committed to engaging and sharing its expertise with the wider Open University community, as well as with colleagues outside the Open University."</em></p>

<p>What better way than a team blog? Or a set of individual blogs aggregated through a <a href="http://suprglu.com">SuprGlu</a> equivalent such as <a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen's</a> <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=33198">MyGlu</a>?</p>

<p>Now - if you're new to blogging, you perhaps won't know why - or how  - this may be interesting. Hmm, where to start? Let's start in a non-obvious way - if the CETLers are blogging (and I think all the CETL <a href="">Teaching Fellows</a> should be required to blog about their projects as a condition fo their fellowship....;-) then those blogposts can be fed as news stories (in summarised/first sentence form) to the Intranet, which is the homepage for a reasonable number of staff, or the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/oulifescreensaver/">OU Screensaver</a> using a 'News from the CETLs' page added tho the screensaver carousel (perhaps limited to internal users if the screensaver can distinguish internal and external use?)</p>

<p>How can this happen? - by the magic of something call <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/rss/default.stm">RSS</a>, that 's how - a format for syndicating stories and news to other websites (I Googled that link on the earch terms 'rss' and 'bbc'; I'm still waiting to be able to do a federated search over all our current online courses, so I could post a link (at least for internal readers) to some OU course material on the subject...if we have any... the <a href="http://tracker.open.ac.uk:8001/SEARCH/BASIS/oudocs/metauser/pres_item/SF">OU archive is slowly becoming keyword searchable</a>, and I hope that soon <em>OUpedia</em> will be a reaility, behind the firewall at least...).</p>

<p>I don't have any examples of RSS being consumed (i.e. used to <em>display</em> information on this page, but if you look at <a href="http://www.robofesta-uk.org">this site</a> you'll see links to news stories from other sites down the left and right hand sides - syndication in action... There is an RSS feed <em>from</em> this page of course (look on the left hand side of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">main page</a> for a link that says <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/index.rdf">Syndicate this site (XML)</a> - the results may look horrible to you, but machines love it...</p>

<p>We're also exploring the use of RSS to syndicate <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004901.html">OU Course News</a>  (or how about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004775.html">course content</a> etc. etc.). There are other sources of RSS in the OU too, such as described on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004420.html">this list</a> and increasingly as provided by the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005253.html">OU Library</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - it probably makes sense to finish off with a list of OU bloggers that I've come across so far. If you're an OU blogger not on the list (and I'm not counting OU student bloggers blogging offsite, though I'd love to hear from you, 'cos I know you're out there...), please mail me and I'll add you to the list:<ul><li><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">Tony Hirst</a></li><li><a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/index.php">Marc Eisenstadt</a>, who I thought was going to live blog some of the Curriculum Conference sessions, but doesn't seem to have ;-)</li><li><a href="http://systems.open.ac.uk/page.cfm?pageid=ChrisBblog">Chris Blackmore</a></li><li><a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/benn/blog/">Neil Benn</a></li><li><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/LTS/prm96/">Pete Mitton</a> (just starting?)</li><li><a href="http://memex.naughtons.org/">John Naughton (offsite)</a><s><em>[marc - you need to update the link on your blog...]</em></s></li><li><a href="http://www.altheim.com/ef/">Murray Altheim</a> (in the Library still?

<p>PS I did a quick search to see if any UK HEI VC's had a blog (like some corporate CEO's do), but couldn't find any to date. I wonder who the first will be...? ;-)</p>

<p>PPS if this blog is taken off air, you'll know I said something that didn't go down too well...perhaps I ought to do a backup...?;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Is Plagiarism Necessarily a Bad Thing?</h3>

<p>...by which I mean: if we set assessment questions/tasks that can be answered using a search engine, and a student <em>locates/discovers</em> a <em>relevant</em> resource that satisifies the assessment, so what? (This begs the question of course - what exactly is the <em>utility</em> of such questions, in any case?!)</p>

<p>Admittedly, it's nice to know what the source of the information was, but a marking scheme can accommodate that easily enough (e.g. with every question carrying marks for the <em>provenance</em> of the answer).</p>

<p>Search engines are changing the landscape - if you know how to use one effectively to solve a problem, find a relevant knowledge source, and so on - then you are arguably better equipped than someone who can remember that the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sum of the squaws on the other two hides.<br />

<h3 class="title">Annotated Google Map References</h3>

<p>Whenever I have to email people directions for a meeting, say, or other gathering, I tend to use an <a title="Micro-info: Easy Peasy Google Maps Labels" href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/08/easy-peasy-google-maps-labels.html">Easy Peasy Google Maps Label</a>.</p>

<p>These are easy enough to generate if you're an everyday URL hacker, but mulling over the question of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005508.html">who web 2.0 is <em>for</em></a> I realised that not everyone is necessarily comfortable doing this.

<h3 class="title">One Click Book Reservation</h3>

<p>Another quickie post - I can do 1-click shopping at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468294/026-6903266-8825226">Amazon</a> and have the book arrive at my home the following day, so why can't I make a 1-click book reservation from the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/">OU Library</a> and have the book delivered to me through the internal mail to my pigeonhole?</p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstand what <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/01/library_20_disc.html">Library 2.0</a> is all about, and library staff don't want to have to do the wandering-round-the-library-like-a-slave-getting-books-for-people-mumble-grumble, but as a user who goes in to the office for a couple of days a week (I work from home, mainly) and often don't have the time to go to the library (which is waaaaaaaay over the other side of the campus), it would be so OUseful if while I was working at home I could 1-click a book collection/delivery service on the library catalogue and know the book would be waiting for me when I got to work.</p>

<h3 class="title">Time for an OU Updater (OUpdater?!)?</h3>

<p>I just spotted this post - <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2006/01/google_packs_re.html">Google Pack's real innovation is Updater</a> - which notes how the <a href="http://pack.google.com/">Google Pack</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/pack/bin/answer.py?answer=30252&topic=8326">updater</a> provides Google with an installation path for future products straight to the desktop...</p>

<p>(The <a href="http://www.sun.com/2005-1004/feature/">Google/Sun collaboration</a> now seems to make more sense - like being able to pipe OpenOffice or Java to someones's desktop for the first time...)</p>

<p>Installing software is a big hassle for many OU students, so this may be something we can learn from. Just imagine, an OU Updater that polls the OU every so often, perhaps around course start dates, and checks to see if you've registered on a new course.</p>

<p>If you have, it checks to see what software is used on that course, downloads it automatically and installs it into a known place (it's often a hassle getting the paths right in OU software installers).</p>

<p>At the end of the course, if the software is so licensed, the OUpdater then removes/uninstalls the software used for that course.</p>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<p><strong>Also related:</strong> <a href="http://connectedflow.com/appcasting/">Appcasting</a> - using feeds to download updates as feed attachments. Imagine users subscribing to the feed when they install a new app, and receiving updates whenever they are published  via the feed. Oh so simple, and perhaps crying out (though beware the security implications!) for integration with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/01/522481.aspx">IE7 RSS/Platform Common Feed List</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">USB Study Stick</h3>

<p>Should the OU be offering students OUseful study and course related software on a USB memory stick? This is a question I have <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003300.html">asked myself</a> - and others -  several times over the last few years, but it was brought to mind <em>this time</em> by of the announcement of <a href="http://pack.google.com/">Google Pack</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Google Pack is a free collection of essential software from Google and other companies. The software in the Google Pack helps you browse the web faster, remove spyware and viruses, organize your photos, and more.<br />
Google Pack also takes the hassle out of downloading, installing, and updating software. You can download and install the entire Google Pack in just a few clicks. And the included Google Updater helps you discover new programs and keep your current software up to date.</blockquote><br />
The pack includes:</p>

<p>- Google Earth - 3D Earth browser<br />
- Google Desktop - Desktop companion<br />
- Picasa - Photo organizer<br />
- Google Toolbar for Internet Explorer - Search toolbar<br />
- Google Pack Screensaver - Photo screensaver<br />
- Mozilla Firefox with Google Toolbar - Web browser (Mozilla Foundation)<br />
- Ad-Aware SE Personal - Antispyware utility (Lavasoft)<br />
- Norton Antivirus 2005 Special Edition - Antivirus utility (Symantec)<br />
- Adobe Reader 7 - PDF reader (Adobe Systems)</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript"><!--<br />
google_ad_client = "pub-4627481582813740";<br />

google_ad_height = 32;<br />
google_ad_format = "110x32_as_rimg";<br />

//--></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br />
</script></p>

<p>The OU already provides a <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/p3.shtml">similar service</a>  - and has done for many years - as a download or via a CD-ROM mailed to every student at the start of every course in the form of our OLA (On Line Applications) CD.</p>

<p>The OLA software includes <em>Software for OU courses</em> (Adobe Reader, FirstClass Client, Kaspersky Anti-Hacker, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Lyceum, StarOffice) as well as additional 3rd party software utilities and drivers (DirectX, Info-ZIP WiZ, Java (JRE), Java Access Bridge, Java Media Framework (JMF), Macromedia Flash, Macromedia Shockwave, Mozilla Firefox).</p>

<p>One problem that has been encountered by OU students repeatedly in a computing context is <em>where</em> they can do their computing related activities.</p>

<p>Many OU students work, many do not have sole access to a home PC and so on.  For working students, who may make use of their work's computing facilities (over lunch, of course...), there is often a restriction on the software they can install on a centrally administered work machine. For students making use of public computers, for example in learning centres or public libraries, there are similar constraints on software availability/installation, as well as the threat of virus infection.</p>

<p>However, with the increasing availability of cheap USB memory sticks, and the rise of <a href="http://portableapps.com">portable applications</a>, I can't help but wonder why we aren't encouraging students to adopt portable working solutions and providing them with (customised) portable application variants?</p>

<p>There is also a marketing/branding or even sales (at cost, of course, or <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ousa/osl/oslhome.htm">for small profit</a>) opportunity in the form of <a href="http://www.usb-flashdrive.co.uk/usb-flash-drive-bulk-range.html">customised, preloaded USB memory sticks</a>.</p>

<p>So, what would be useful on a USB Study Stick?<br />
<ul><li>the <a title="Portable Apps Suite | PortableApps.com" href="http://portableapps.com/suite">Portable Apps Suite</a> would perhaps be overkill, although <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/office/suites/portable_openoffice">Portable Open Office</a> would be generally useful, although if users had an option (in the case of a downloaded offering) of any of the <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/office">separate Open Office applications</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/browsers/portable_firefox">Portable Firefox</a> would also be a wise choice, particularly if it was customised with pre-installed extensions that might be useful for students and OUseful default settings (like being able to accept browser extension downloads from www.open.ac.uk). It would also be sensible to include preinstalled Mycroft <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchtools.php">OU search options</a> (with OU search engine as a default?), <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_keyword_searches">quick searches</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html">smart keywords</a>, and perhaps an OU <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/">student homepage</a> default, as well as an OU toolbar (or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library toolbar</a>.  In the longer term, it would be interesting to see extensions such as <a href="http://annozilla.mozdev.org/">Annozilla</a>  included and preconfigured to access an OU hosted <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">Annotea server</a></li><br />
<li>A <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/office/organization/calendar_extension">portable Calendar</a> perhaps (or <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/office/organization/portable_sunbird">standalone</a>), especially if it could consume course calendar RSS feeds containing assessment dates (e.g. TMA due dates, due date for ECA, or ECA exam date), study week start dates annotated with the topics for that week's study, course book/set book reading for particular week, etc.?</li><br />
<li>a <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/rss">portable RSS reader</a>, preconfigured with relevant <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004420.html">OU feeds</a> and easily configured <a href="">course news feeds</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005253.html">OU Library info</a> and even <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004775.html">RSS delivered course content</a>;<li><br />
<li>a portable <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php">podcast</a> application, with preinstalled links to OU podcasts (I'm not sure if there are any available at the moment?).</li></ul></p>

<p>Why this focus on portability ('portable learning'), rather than a web based VLE or PLE, or online office suite that offers the required functionality? Because that protoypical extreme environment OU student - the submariner - can't guarantee web access for weeks on end and will need to work locally. (The same is true of students with dial-up access and teenage children who hog the phone...;-) </p>

<p>I wonder, too, whether there is scope for a <em>portable personal learning enviroment</em> (PPLE)?</p>

<p>PS I got a <a href="http://creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=215&product=10919">Creative Muvo</a> which doubles up MP3 playing capabilities with a Flash drive; so I can have my portable context on the device, and use it to play any MP3 (or WMA) files I happen to have on it...nice! :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Firefox Smart Keywords</h3>

<p>I've known about Firefox <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_keyword_searches">keyword/quick searches</a> for a long time (basically - associate a keyword with a bookmark, and then visit the bookmarked site by enetering the keyword in the browser location bar), and I use them quite a bit, but I hadn't realised before how <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html"><em>smart</em></a> the tools surrounding them are...</p>

<p>If you don't know what a Smart Keyword is, just <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html">read this</a> and give it a go, even if you don't do anything else today...</p>

<p><a href="http://yubnub.org">Yubnub</a> seems to do something similar in a <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/urlrewrite">URL rewriting</a> sense, using an 'online command line', although it's not quite as easy to create new 'commands'...</p>

<h3 class="title">Peer Review 2.0</h3>

<p>Seeing this post just now - <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/01/digging_the_madness_of_crowds_1.html">O'Reilly Radar > Digging The Madness of Crowds</a> - about how an unchecked, largely untrue story rose to prominence on <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, resonated with one aspect of something I've been mulling around for a few days with respect to the question of <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2005/11/are_blogs_academic_publication_1.html">Are Blogs Academic Publications?</a> having originally doodled around the idea <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005297.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The quality of the great majority of even the best blog posts still falls short, in word count at least, and work effort, I suspect, of most academic journal (and perhaps conference) publications. After all, why put the effort in if there is no payoff in terms of academic brownie points, or a jolly to a conference!</p>

<p>I'm not sure where in the quality scheme of things blog posts should come, but I suspect that in some cases it's not so far off parity with a workshop poster presentation.</p>

<p>Now publications as minor as this won't boost an academic CV too much, (although they may help to provide a bit of bulk!), <em>except</em> insofar as they demonstrate that an academic is participating in that form of discourse that is available through the blogosphere.</p>

<p>However, if blog posts do have a place at the bottom of the academic publication chain, then it would perhaps be interesting if the academic publishers started exploring ways of introducing academic quality measures such as some form of peer review.</p>

<p>The payoffs that immediately come to my mind for the publishers are exposure, a testbed for novel peer review mechanisms, and the ability to spot upcoming issues that might make for a good special issue, for example.</p>

<p>So - how might the academic publishers get into the blogging community (or perhaps they already are? Do any journals have 'blogclips' reviews of relevant news items pulled from the blogosphrere?) </p>

<p>Well - perhaps <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> provides a useful model (although as the link at the top of this post suggests, there are potentially problems with that approach).</p>

<p>The idea with Digg is that someone posts a story link, which is associated with a topic and a voting button. Other readers who 'digg' the story can vote for it. Stories with the most (recent) diggsfrloat to the top of the Dig new story list. Sort of - you can <a href="http://digg.com/faq">read the actual details here</a>.</p>

<p>So here's where one possible academic publishing twist might come in. A social bookmarking system such as Connotea, which has academic credibility, set up the ability to post at least a link to a blog story, if not the blog post itself, to a particular journal's bookmarking/news area (a Digg site dedicated to, or topic partitioned for, that journal). Queued stories (i.e. ones that have been submitted but not 'reviewed') are listed in a hlding area. Reviewers from the journal are allowed to 'digg-yes' or 'digg-no' the post if they think it is useful/interesting/relevant, or not. This is a minimal form of lightweight review, and shouldn't impose too much on the reviewer, particularly if the digg-act has a side effect of adding the link (or not, for a digg-no vote) to the user's preferred social bookmarking system, if they use one. Stories that have enough positive votes are promoted to the Journals front page, and perhaps featured as a 'blog letter', maybe with blogosphere comments/commentary attached (perhaps public 'offcial' reviewer comments to the blog post could be made to, and hosted on, the journal's site - a bit like a social commentary in a <br />
social bookmarking system... <a href="http://www.shadows.com/">Shadows</a> supports this sort of feature, I think, as does <a href="http://www.connotea.org/guide#comments">Connotea</a>.)</p>

<p>Now I know this system relies on the journal having 1) a relatively large number of reviewers, who 2) are active web users, but if there is a growing tide of Academic 2.0 types, then perhaps  Peer Review 2.0 models will become more likely. (ENOUGH of the 2.0, -Ed!)</p>

<h3 class="title">Web 2.0 for Who?</h3>

<p>I note with interest this announcement by Stephen Downes of a forthcoming <a title="Stephen's Web ~ by Stephen Downes ~" href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=33198">MyGlu</a>, which:<br />
<blockquote>performs the functionality of SuprGlu - that is, it brings together different RSS feeds into a single display - does it in such a way as to allow you to put your Glu on your own site, allows you to use feeds other than your own, and lets you filter the output.</blockquote><br />
In addition, Stephen will<br />
<blockquote>make the script available (and it's pretty simple to run). And don't have to use my site - or SuprGlu's - at all.</blockquote><br />
The rationale?<br />
<blockquote>Web 2.0 is supposed to be all about empowering the user and distributing content, not the manifestation of some eyeball-driven business plan. I wish more coders (and pundits) would recognize that.</blockquote><br />
Now I agree with those sentiments wholeheartedly, but I think it's fair to ask the question: Web 2.0 allows <em>who</em> to do all this neat remixing and mashing stuff?</p>

<p>I think there are three broad ways of making the most of Web2.0 in an interoperability/mashing sense (rather than a content co-creation sense):<br />
<ul><li>Web site users who can make use of the services offered by SuprGlu, are happy adding content feeds to google/ig or netvibes etc., can possibly work out how to pull a feed from one place and consume it in another, and so on. Tese users proibably also need the site to be well designed in terms of usability, and probably also prefer a friendly visual design, bright colour theme etc etc. For the sake of argument, let's also suppose these users have never seen a bit of html or javascript and wouldn't know what to do with it if they did.</li><li>Client side, web page developers, who can tinker with html and at least reuse/call on other people's Javscript functions, even if they don't know how to write Javascript (i.e. they can di a script include); at the other end of the spectrum in this category are experienced Javascript developers who can write their own elaborate Javascripted pages and develop, from scratch, complex web page application (i.e. web pages that embed functionality on the client side using script). Client side developers don't have access to servers, can't mount PHP scripts etc.</li><li>Server side developers, that again spread across quite a wide spectrum, from users who can ask a friendly sys admin to put up a script, users who can install a script but wouldn't know what to do if it failed to work, and can only administer it through a provided web page interface, that ideally handles configuration too, users who can install a script off the web and are happy to cutomise it, and users who can write complex scripts from scratch etc.</li></ul><br />
(Okay - okay, so things like Ning will perhaps change all this - opening up the ability to reuse complex server side) functionality through a free web page interface...but I don't think we're there quite yet in terms of (naive) users knowing what services there are out there that they can make use of.)</p>

<p>So - while I'm looking forward to making use of Stephen's script, I also think that services such as SuprGlu do - and will continue - to provide the most accessible/usable service for the majority of  web users.</p>

<h3 class="title">The Utility of Social Bookmarking Environments</h3>

<p>I'm just back from a quick dog walk, where I had a moment or two's reflection on what social bookmarking environments are good for.</p>

<p>On and off over the last few months, I've exchanged occasional mailing list posts and blog comments with <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/">Todd@Big IDEA</a> on the matter of having different personal profiles within a social bookmarking environment.  Todd's been looking at the for ScuttlEdu, most recently here: <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2006/01/social-bookmarking-one-account-multiple-profiles/">One account, multiple profiles</a>.</p>

<p>Related to this is the idea of <em>private</em> bookmarks, whether for individuals or groups,  which allow you to partition your bookmarks into public and private spaces.</p>

<p>Now, one of the oft quoted arguments <em>against</em> private groups especially within social bookmarking systems is that by splitting the population numbers you get less added value from the sociality of the environment.</p>

<p>And this is partly true. (I say partly because I think there is value in subject specific groupings where you have a chance of building up expert communities of practice.)</p>

<p>For most benefit in a social software system, you need a critical mass of active participants, and it can be dangerous to split your community.</p>

<p>However - and this is where my reflection about my personal assumptions regarding social bookmarking systems comes in - I think that as well as providing a social, community utility, with added value from sharing bookmarks and resoucres, <em>many social bookmarking systems have a utility in their own right as a <strong>personal</strong> personal bookmarking environment</em>.</p>

<p>Thios is particularly true of systems like CiteULike and Connotea where you get added value in the automation of academic reference collection.</p>

<p>And because many of us are lazy, it's <em>convenient</em> to keep all our bookmarks in one place (as well as taking up the free automation offers!).</p>

<p>So I might, for example, predominantly use a social bookmarking system in a purely <em>selfish</em> way, to the extent that I am largely bookmarking for myself.</p>

<p>But because it costs me nothing to share, I'm happy to.</p>

<p>Now, one of the ways I'm coming at the use of social bookmarking in education is that bookmarking in and of itslef can be a useful thing to get into the habit of, whether or not its social. </p>

<p>If there is a criticial mass of active community members, then you may start to get social benefits.</p>

<p>But that isn't to say you won't also get a <em>personal</em> benefit from keeping track of things you personally found interesting/useful even in the absence of beneficisal social effects.</p>

<p>So what am I saying - that one of my core assumptions is that <em>bookmarking</em> is a good thing to do. That if you do it in a social way, there may be a social benefit. But if there isn't - so what? You still have a useful <em>personal</em> resource...<br />

<h3 class="title">Tag Entry Syntax</h3>

<p>I just twigged a *huge* assumption I'd made with respect to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPML.html">Social Bookmarking OPML/RSS Feed Generator</a> last night, specifally the format used (by default) to enter tags and tag combinations.</p>

<p>Because I tend to use delicious more than any other social bookmarking system, I'd opted for the delicious tag entry format - single word, space separated tags (the same for specifying multiple users).</p>

<p>But different systems use different tag entry formats, as pointed out by this 37 Signals post on just that subject: <a title="Tag formats: Can't we all just get along? - Signal vs. Noise (by 37signals)" href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/tag_formats_cant_we_all_just_get_along.php">Tag formats: Can't we all just get along? - Signal vs. Noise (by 37signals)</a></p>

<p>I don't know if there is a tagging syntax analysis out there anywhere looking at social bookmarking systems in particular (if you know of one, please add the link as a comment to this post:-), so here's a quick summary for the systems covered by the OPML generator:<ul><li>del.icio.us - single word, space separated, case insensitive;</li><li>simpy - single word(?), comma separated, case insensitive;</li><li>Connotea - space or comma separated; multi-word tags enclosed in "quotes";</li><li>Scuttle - comma separated;</li><li>CiteULike - </li></ul></p>

<p>The following compounding (?) structures are also used to join words (and perhaps there are other conventions too? Please add them as a comment...):<ul><li>hyphen: compound-tag</li><li>underscore: compound_tag</li><li>perdio/dot: compound.tag</li><li>simple concatenation: compoundtag</li><li>Upper Camel Case: CompoundTag</li><li>lower Camel Case: compoundTag</li></ul></p>

<p>So - that's something else on the to do list, then - a preference setting for the preferred style of tag entry... </p>

<p>(You can see what I'm working towards, perhaps - a single interface onto a whole variety of social bookmarking systems ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Generator With Customisable Feeds</h3>

<p>Following a few comments regarding the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPML.html">Social Bookmarking Feeds OPML Generator</a>, I've updated the page so that it now also supports <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, <a href="http://www.scuttle.org/">Scuttle</a>  and customised feeds PS and will also generate lists of plain RSS feed URLs <em>without</em> an OPML wrapper.</p>

<p>The 'custom feed' option allows you to define the path to a social bookmarking service and mark it as conforming to some of the current standards, particulary the open source bookmarking systems.</p>

<p><img alt="customSBOPML.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/customSBOPML.JPG" width="663" height="511" border="0" /></p>

<p>PS I've also just added a switch (though code is horribly clunky...:-( that allows you to turn off the OPML wrapper and just generate a list of RSS feed URLs.</p>

<p><img alt="suppressOPML.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/suppressOPML.JPG" width="668" height="259" border="0" /></p>

<p>I'm well aware that feeds for groups -which are supported by several of the systems - is not available, but this is on my 2-3 week horizon to-do list.</p>

<h3 class="title">More on SOcial Bookmark Synching...</h3>

<p>A few more late night thoughts on social bookmark synching, as I take time out from an end-of-course assignment marking marathon :-(</p>

<p>The immediate setting comes from a couple of posts I just stumbled across (Todd on <a title="Big IDEA » Social bookmarking: one account, multiple profiles" href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2006/01/social-bookmarking-one-account-multiple-profiles/">Social bookmarking: one account, multiple profiles</a>, Stephen on some forthcoming <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=33176">RSS synching services coming to Edu-RSS</a>) and my first look at the del.icio.us daily blog (you can get the idea of what it's about from <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/001028.html">here</a>, but basically it's a scheduled post from delicious to a blogging service of your links for the day...)</p>

<p>So - What's the Story (Morning Glory;-)?</p>

<p>The problem is this - how to synch from one social bookmarking system to another?</p>

<p>Let's refine that a little - how can we synch a <em>subset</em> of bookmarks, corresponding to a (set of) tag(s) from one bookmarking system to another on a regualr basis?</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that there are two obvious ways of getting the bookmarks from system A into system B:</p>

<p>1) system B subscribes to a feed <em>from</em> system A, and polls it on a regular basis;</p>

<p>2) system A pushes links <em>to</em> system B on a regular basis (for example, using a system like del.icio.us' daily blog, with filters attached).</p>

<p>At the current time, I don't think that any social bookmarking systems will let you subscribe to a feed (RSS in the single case, OPML for an RSS bundle), or that del.ico.us allows you to push anything other than all of the day's links to a blog.  But with either of these features in place, I think it would be another step or two along the road to a striaghtforward mashup of a distributed, synched social bookmarking system...</p>

<p>I'm not too sure, admittedly, about how happy Joshua (or the Yahoo! paymasters!;-) would be about pushing links on a regular basis into a rival bookmarking system, though...</p>

<p>However, I do think it would be interesting if something like Simpy, or developers for something like Scuttle, were to implement a bloglike API that could spoof a real blogging system's API and act as the target for a del.ico.us daily blog post (I wonder if rival social bookmarking system URLs would be blocked if they tried to do this?).</p>

<p>If a social bookmarking were so enabled, then it would be possible to make us of the del.icio.us daily blog feature.</p>

<p>Assuming that del.ico.us only continues to push <em>all</em> a user's daily postings, rather than allowing the daily blog to be filtered by tag or tag combination, for example, it would also be useful if the blogSpoof API had some filters attached so that only posts relating to certain tags or tag combinations were passed through... </p>

<h3 class="title">Synching Social Bookmarking Systems</h3>

<p>How effective is social bookmark synching? Earlier this week I <br />
<a title="OUseful Info: Bookmark Synching, Bookmark Searching..." href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005497.html">posted</a> about the synching services offered by <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a>, <a href="http://spurl.net">Spurl</a> and <a href="http://wink.com">Wink</a>. <br />
(NB <a href="http://scuttle.org/">Scuttle</a> will also synch with del.icio.us). Here are a few more thoughts, particularly insofar as they relate to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005336.html">distributed social bookmarking</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, the synching service appears to be a one off - I click the button and the bookmarks are copied across to the service from del.icio.us (typically...).</p>

<p>Now I can understand this mode of operation when I want to sync a service with my browser favourites (not that I use those anymore...) - there's no way that the service can easily grab any bookmarks I've made since the last sync operation from my browser.</p>

<p>But that's not true for the online bookmarking services. Once I've set up a synch-link, it would be handy if I could set up a daily top-up, for example, whereby the service I'm synching <em>into</em> subscribes to my personal RSS feed at the service I'm synching <em>from</em> and grabs all the latest additions and changes.</p>

<p>Why would this be useful? Well, it would let me bookmark in a mixed way, for example using a del.icio.us account for home bookmarking, CiteULike or Connotea for work related links, and so on, whilst still maintaining an meta-archive of <em>all</em> my links.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.suprglu.com">Suprglu</a> does this for <a href="http://psychemedia.suprglu.com/">me</a> with my various blog feeds, and I think it would be handy to have a related service for my bookmarks...</p>

<p>I could quite imagine a star based system architecture, whereby one or two major systems will synch from large numbers of minor social bookmarking systems, and perhaps also synch back to them (e.g. I think Wink will update del.icio.us with any (or is that just particularly tagged?) bookmarks I make in Wink).</p>

<p>If the major social bookmarking systems/hubs then synched between each other, we could have quite a fluid(?!), automated transport of links across the systems.</p>

<p>Putting filters in place, so as to only synch certain tags or tag combinations, would allow users to maintain different profiles of themselves on different systems. Being able to set synch frequency, or support pings (both incoming and outgoing), would also be useful.</p>

<p>I've argued before that individuals maintaining more than one social bookmarking persona is not necessarily a bad thing - for example, I desire different tools when making personal bookmarks as compared to academic, work or research related bookmarks; I require different search tools for these different aspects of my online behavior; when recommendation systems start mining my bookmarks I may want to cultivate different personas, and so on.</p>

<p>The growth of <em>lensing</em> applications such as <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/">Squidoo</a> or <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H2O Playlist</a> and personal/customised search applications such as <a href="http://www.scoopgo.com/">ScoopGO!</a> (do they want Yahoo! to buy them, do you think!?), or <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo</a>, as well as the  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005493.html"><em>people-powered search engines</em></a>, suggests that <em>aggregation</em> and <em>synching</em> tools will be useful for those of us who don't just adopt whatever service I use first because it came via my browser's default homepage/bandwidth provides portal.</p>

<p>PS As to what other services should be synched to - <a href="http://www.connotea.org">Connotea</a> would be handy for me, along with <a href="http://www.citeulike.org">CiteULike</a> which I haven't really used yet, but which is near the top of my 'to play with' list...</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Bookmarking Systems OPML Feed Generator</h3>

<p>Following the previous couple of posts on an OPML generating web page application for collating the RSS feeds for the <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> social bookmarking systems, I have now tidied up the code, added <a href="http://www.connotea.org">Connotea</a> to the mix, and included support for generating feeds that cover several systems at once.</p>

<p><img alt="Social Bookmarking Systems OPML Generator" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbOPMLGenerator.JPG" width="664" height="481" border="0" /></p>

<p>Please feel free to try out this new version of my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPML.html">Social Bookmarking Systems OPML Feed Generator</a>.</p>

<p>All comments appreciated, especially bug reports, suggestions for other social bookmarking systems to include, and details about how you've used the generated OPML feeds/which online services or desktop applications you've used them with, etc.</p>

<h3 class="title">OPML Generator now includes Simpy...</h3>

<p>Following up on yesterday's post about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005499.html">del.icio.us OPML Generator</a>, I have just uploaded <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/SBFeedsOPML.html">a new OPML generator</a> page that will generate an OPML listing for <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a> feeds, as well as for <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't fully checked yet (of course!), and the code is cobbled together rather than properly desiegned (in fact, the code is <em>really</em> horrible and kludged), so it may contain a few 'features'... but as lunchtime is over, I have no more time to look at this today.</p>

<p>Any problems, please leave me a comment (or send me a working version!).</p>

<h3 class="title">Embedded Livelinks </h3>

<p>This is a quick test (in the context of this blog) for embedding del.icio.us fed links within a popup tooltip.</p>

<p>The core library is one I have used before - Walter Zorn's (?) <a title="DHTML JavaScript Tooltips" href="http://www.walterzorn.com/tooltip/tooltip_e.htm">DHTML JavaScript Tooltips</a> and demoed briefly <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So - here's the demo then. Err - not it's not actually - the code has been breaking some RSS readers, so till I get a chance to fix it, the facility isn't running...</p>

<p>If you want to see waht it looks like, save this page and add the link:</p>

<p>&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/livelinks+ajh" onmouseover="this.T_SHADOWWIDTH=5;this.T_STICKY=1;this.T_OFFSETX=-32;return escape('&lt;div id=demo&gt;&lt;\/div&gt&lt;script&gt;document.getElementById(\'demo\').appendChild(ul)&lt;\/script&gt;')"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>To see the demo: a) add the above code to the page; b) ensure javascript is enabled; and c) to hover your cursor over the link.<script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/psychemedia/livelinks+ajh"></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="deliciousJson.js"></script><br />
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="wz_tooltip.js"></script></p>

<p>The offset is a bit off, though I'm not sure why - perhaps it has something to do with where the table containing the links is placed? My understanding was that the tooltip should be offset from the mouse cursor by a certain amount, but it seems an additional offset has crept in somewhere.</p>

<p>The del.icio.us links are pulled in using a <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/json">del.icio.us JSON feed</a>, which is something I need to look at more. (If you're new to JSON - as I am really - <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/12/21/json-dynamic-script-tag.html">here's a 101</a>.)</p>

<h3 class="title">del.icio.us OPML Generator</h3>

<p>One of the things I hope to look at in earnest this year are tools for managing the display of link resources, such as my social bookmarks via their RSS feeds.</p>

<p>This 'work' is an obvious extension to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=myopenlibrary">MyOpenLibrary</a> odoodles I made last year.</p>

<p>Importing del.icio.us links into services such as <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> (which I identified as one possibly appropriate environment) can be simplified if the links are made available as bundles via an appropriate RSS/syndication feed. These bundles will contain a list of related links, as for example characterised by some combination of username and/or tag(s). Collections of bundles (i.e. collections of RSS feeds) can then be combined in an OPML file.</p>

<p>As a short term measure, I have popped up a crude OPML generator for producing collections of links to del.icio.us RSS feeds to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliciousFeedsOPML.html">del.icio.us OPML generator</a>.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<p><img alt="opmlGen.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/opmlGen.JPG" width="676" height="490" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment, you have to copy and paste the OPML into a text file, which can then be saved and uploaded to wherever. I'll work on a more satisfactory way of saving this info if I get a chance.</p>

<h3 class="title">Bookmark Synching, Bookmark Searching...</h3>

<p>Just a few days in to the New Year, and my year has already been made by the discovery of several neat, though possibly longstanding!, interoperability features on a couple of social bookmarking systems that I have been rather neglecting...</p>

<p>In a recent post ("<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005336.html">Distributed Socail Bookmarking</a>") I doodled a few thoughts about social bookmarking interoperability.</p>

<p>That post led, in part, to me joining a <a href="http://www.simpy.com/group/64">Social software</a> group on <a href="http://www.simpy.com/">Simpy</a>, with the intention, in part, that we could use that group to track some of the work that is going on in the area of social software interoperability (<em>distributed social software</em>?).</p>

<p>But that's not what this post is about...(it's just for your reference, dear reader, to try and get you to have a look at Simpy if you haven't been over there for a bit :-)</p>

<p>No - what this post is about is the fun I've been having over the last hour synching my <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks with other social bookmarking systems, in particular:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.spurl.net/">Spurl</a></li><li><a href="http://wink.com/">Wink</a></li></ul><br />
I've mentioned <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005493.html">before</a> , in the context of it as a people-powered search engine ("<em>Search the Web - Powered by People</em>"). That is, the top search results from a query relate to sites that have been recommneded (in the sense that they have been bookmarked, and possibly 'starred') by Wink subscribers.</p>

<p>One of the features that appealed to me at first was the del.icio.us import facility, which meant I could import all the sites I have bookmarked there, and make them available for search.</p>

<p>One thing I had assumed - but which does not appear to be possible on Wink - was that I would be able to search my bookmarked sites. This would be really handy for rediscovery of resources, of course, as well as providing a <a href="http://rollyo.com/">Rollyo</a> type service that I've dreamed about <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/11/rollyo-portable-pagelinks-search.html">here</a> (and implicitly(?! - but not so you'd notice!) <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">here</a>, too).</p>

<p>However, I don't think Wink let's you search your own bookmarked sites, in the same way that <a href="http://zniff.com/">Zniff</a> doesn't.</p>

<p><em>Zniff</em>??? This was doing the rounds some time ago in the blogosphere (e.g. on <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2005/04/10/zniff-clusters/"Library clips</a>) as a human powered search engine (this time powered by <a href="http://www.spurl.net">Spurl</a>).</p>

<p>What's interesting about Zniff, however, is that you can use it on Spurl to search just your <em>Spurl</em>ed resources...</p>

<p>And what makes it even better is that Spurl supports the import - and two-way synching (I think - though I have yet to check it out in practice) - of bookmarks with del.icio.us.</p>

<p>Another service that supports synching with del.icio.us (and they're looking for more third party sites to synch with if anyone has any suggestions...) is <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a>. For a long time, Simpy has provided one of the best <a href="http://www.simpy.com/simpy/FAQ.do#search">search interfaces</a> in a social bookmarking system, and now I realise I can use it to search through my bookmarked resources...hmm, I wonder, can I use it to just search those sites I have bookmarked to a particular group, I wonder...? (Does anyone know of a good "Simpy search" tutorial, per chance?)</p>

<p>With Yahoo!'s puchase of del.icio.us (which I really can't be bothered to link to again...) del.icio.us powered searches - perhaps through <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!'s MyWeb 2.0</a> service (or even <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com">Y!Q context sensitive search</a>, somehow (perhaps tag-context sensitive?)) - or Yahoo! powered del.icio.us search - will possibly leapfrog some of the competition...</p>
