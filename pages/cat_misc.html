<p>Here's another thought along the lines of the CMC same/different time/place grid as applied to Twitter I mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014919.html">Twitter and "Desynchronous" Communication</a>... Twitter seems to be all over the place if you plotted a scatter chart opf different interaction modes on these axes:</p>

<p>1 sender and 0 receivers (or maybe 0 readers) - late night tweet to no-one and it gets lost...</p>

<p>1 sender to 1 or 2 explicitly identified receivers -  I just tweeted @one or @two people.</p>

<p>Lots of senders, not really thinking about who's receiving it - something's happening (an earthquake, maybe?)</p>

<p>Lots of senders, 1 recipient (maybe that someone asked a question to their followers (1 sender, lots of recipients) and lots of people are replying?)</p>

<p>It's also worth bearing in mind that mass action trends are identifiable on Twitter: <a href="http://trendspotting.corank.com/tech/tag/twitter"><em>Twitter</em> on Trendspotting</a>.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cmc" rel="tag">cmc</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20this%20is%20the%20sort%20of%20trivial%20unthought%20through%20observation%20that%20people%20write%20up%20and%20present%20in%20papers%20in%20dodgy%20conferences%20and%20journals%20isn't%20it%3F" rel="tag"> this is the sort of trivial unthought through observation that people write up and present in papers in dodgy conferences and journals isn't it?</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>In the quaint language of academia,  "CMC" - computer-mediated communication - is the phrase typically used to identify person-to-person electronic communications. Oftentimes, CMC tools are classed as either synchronous or asynchronous and then plotted on this sort of matrix (e.g. <a href="http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Computer_Mediated_Instruction">Computer Mediated Instruction</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2616149410/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2616149410_25af7eef64.jpg" alt="cmc" height="257" width="352" /></a></p>

<p>(Other dimensions you can add in are one-to-one communication, one-to-many, many-to-many and so on...)</p>

<p>But it seems to me that I increasingly use many asynchronous tools in a "near-synchronous" or "presynchronous" way, and potentially synchronous toos in an asynchronous ('desynchronous'?) way.</p>

<p>For example, twitter allows me to engage in one-to-one (private), one-to-one (cocktail party) and one-to-many way in near real time, or with an arbitrarily long gap between statement and response. Instant messaging allows me to engage in synchronous conversation or send message to people offline, knowing they'll be able to pick them up when they are online. (Ands others have noticed from their own perspective, (e.g. <a href="http://www.offmessage.com/2008/06/on-twitter/">On Twitter</a>), my IM usage has gone down since I started tweeting...)</p>

<p>Looking again at the above figure, it seems to me that twitter pretty much falls into every quadrant: for example, top right is the conference room backchannel, bottom right is the backchannel open to the world. Top left are asynchronous wrokplace tweets ("anyone for coffee"), and bottom right are end of day tweets that may not be picked up till tomorrow (if at all).</p>

<p>SMS has similar properties maybe, but requires a different access device and one that is maybe not so amenable to flow, when compared to an ever open or oft-looked at computer window?</p>

<p>Ramble, ramble, ramble; not sure what I meant to post about, really...</p>

<p>Earlier today I tweeted about something I've been thinking about on and off for years: </p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/clock/mtgAcct.php?num=7&amp;sal=2500000&amp;expenses=100" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2365/2594854165_68f85ed4b9.jpg" alt="2008-06-20_1641" height="242" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So here we go: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/clock/mtgAcct.php?num=7&amp;sal=25000&amp;expenses=100">Meeting accounter</a>...</p>

<p>Customise your counter via the URL: <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/clock/mtgAcct.php?num=7&amp;sal=25000&amp;expenses=100</em><br />
<ul><li><em>num</em>: number of meeting participants;</li><br />
<li><em>sal</em>: average salary (whole pounds/dollars);</li><br />
<li><em>expenses</em>: should be "overheads", really (in whole pounds/dollars); any immediate/direct costs covered by the meeting (travel expenses, coffee and biscuits etc. etc.).</li></ul><br />
When you load the page, it'll start calculating how much you've spent on the meeting so far, in units of pounds/pence (dallars/cents). The counter maxes out at 10k ;-)</p>

<p>If the counter is displayed during the meeting, then everyone can decide whether or not the meeting is generating a sensible return. Whoever has the courage to call off a meeting on the grounds it probably isn't worth it should get 10% of the expected meeting costs saved to spend on a project of their choice (no meetings allowed ;-).</p>

<p>Related to this, I suggest every meeting has as part of the meeting minutes a standard area along with attendees/apologies etc. that reports the 'person days equivalent' spent attending the minuted meeting, and the 'ballpark cost' of that meeting, e.g. as measured by the meeting accounter). When the minutes are being agreed, everyone can be asked "so was it worth the expense?"</p>

<p>As the culture of 'meeting accountancy" evolves, you could imagine that when agreeing an agenda for a future meeting, an 'expected cost of meeting' estimate should be attached, along with the expected ROI of that meeting, so everyone can clarify what the meeting is supposed to achieve in terms of return ;-)</p>

<p>As the time and effort of calculating the costs and returns of meetings increases/becomes appropriately burdensome, a process of "pre-meeting costings" should be instituted, where the costs of calculating the costs and returns of the meeting are added into the&nbsp; costs of the meeting. (To offset costs incurred during a meeting, the cost of time spent diary setting for the NEXT meeting should be allowed to be carried forward to the NEXT meeting (so the next meeting is costed for the time spent in the previous meeting setting it up). Any decisions pushed forward to a future meeting can also be costed back from that future meeting to the previous meeting. To offset bankrupting future meetings by overlabouring 'next meeting date' activity, any time spent after the meeting having to rearrange dates/times for the next meeting should be costed back to the meeting where the date was set. To prevent future meetings bankrupting previous meetings (e.g. by virtue of spending large amounts of time rearranging meeting dates or addressing issues pushed forward by a previous meeting), no future meetings should ever be agreed to by anyone.</p>

<p>PS if you haven't already seen it: <a href="http://blogoehlert.typepad.com/eclippings/2008/06/omgthere-are-sp.html">OMG...There are spies everywhere sabotaging our organizations!!</a>. Declassified espionage manual suggests sabotage teechniques that actually read like "Meeting Guidance" notes.</p>

<p>If you follow any North American edublogs, you probably can't fail to have noticed a whole flurry of recent posts on "Edupunk". Capturing the spirit of the times, <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/">Jim Groom</a>'s call to arms last week inspired many, confused some, and even offended a few... There's a wealth of good posts on the topic, of which I've especially liked <a href="http://arynna.umwblogs.org/2008/06/01/edupinions/">EDUPINIONS</a> (for the student voice), <a href="http://injenuity.com/archives/186">@Injenuity</a> for the zen-like response, question setting <a href="http://www.chrislott.org/2008/05/28/edupunk-or-eduhacker/">edupunk or eduhacker</a>, and <a href="http://www.dougbelshaw.com/2008/05/30/are-you-an-edupunk-im-not/">Doug Belshaw</a> (for not liking it at all;-) The <a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3045/frustrated-with-corporate-course-management-systems-some-professors-go-edupunk">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> need thanking for legitimising the term to the extent it helped get it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edupunk">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2008/06/defending-edupunk.html">Downes</a> for providing some clarification and <a href="http://www.darcynorman.net/2008/05/28/on-edupunk/">D'ArcyNorman</a>, who <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2538449892/">seriously freaked some of us out on Saturday morning</a>... If it's a badge you're after, <a href="http://edtechpost.wikispaces.com/edupunk+merit+badges">Scott Leslie's done 'em...</a>;-) (but who's doin' the t-shirts?;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, stuck for a way of putting together a 5 minute presentation to a group of educational publishers on the topic of "Changing User Expectations: Finding and Using Content" that was (is) to be delivered in my absence this coming Friday (the CRiG Barcamp invite came first...;-), I took heart from Jim's rallying cry and put together a little something that I hope captures something of the energy and spirit of eduPunk, howsoever you want to define it or capitalise it...;-)</p>

<p>The following works best on full screen view and with the volume turned up LOUD!</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fabjectlearning%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F965966%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fweblogs%2Eelearning%2Eubc%2Eca%2Fbrian%2Fsource%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" width="400" height="255" allowfullscreen="true" id="showplayer"><param name="movie" value="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fabjectlearning%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F965966%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fweblogs%2Eelearning%2Eubc%2Eca%2Fbrian%2Fsource%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" /><param name="quality" value="best" /><embed src="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fabjectlearning%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F965966%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fweblogs%2Eelearning%2Eubc%2Eca%2Fbrian%2Fsource%3D3&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&brandname=blip%2Etv&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" quality="best" width="400" height="255" name="showplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></p>

<p>(The original swf file came in at 21 MB and can be found <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/presentations/changingExpectations.swf">here</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/046651.php">Brian Lamb</a> and <a href="http://andremalan.net/">@ramcio</a> for sorting out the format translation and posting the movie to blip. I owe you one, guys:-) If you want to embed it (feel free:-) and would rather have a Youtube version, here's <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0"><em>changing expectations</em> on Youtube</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the mix tells it's own story...though I will post some notes to back it up later in the week.</p>

<p>It was put together on a Mac, using Keynote, with handcrafted timings. The original swf file was generated by loading the soundtrack into the presentation, and then exporting the presentation (with soundtrack) as a standalone, free playing presentation. To synch the slides and the audio, I set the presentation running from the first slide in whatever sequence I was working on, and played the music from an appropriately located start marker in Audacity. The original plan had been to create the whole mix in iMovie (which I've never used before), but inspiration failed me for the best way to create the slides... So I went into Keynote (looking for iMovie integration features) and ended up staying there... For a 4m 15s or song, I reckoned about 3s per slide, requiring around about 85 slides. I actually created 100 or so, including slides for each of the lyrics, which were copied from a random lyric server website, then edited the visuals down. All in all, it took about 6 and a half hours (including a quick dog walk for inspiration;-) Finding the images took a surprisingly long time... (mainly using flickr, with a Creative Commons licence search limit).</p>

<p>Next time, I figure on trying something like Jumpcut...?<br />

<p>Okay, so I'm getting really lazy with the blog lately (been churning the words, just not in public:-( so here's a bit more cut and pasting, this time not even from me. Instead, it's from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/framework/bbc_service_licences/bbc_co_uk.html">BBC Trust report on <em>bbc.co.uk</em></a>, the Beeb's online presence.</p>

<p>I figure I can getaway with the huge quote becuase it's not likely that anyone's gonna click through and read the report, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the bits that are of particular relevance (maybe) to the OU, and the OU Broadcast strategy review (which I guess since it has finished now probably means no-one's interested in what's happening in broadcast any more? Even the intranet search no longer returns anything relevant when I search it for <em>broadcast review</em>, and when I search for the <em>phrase</em> "broadcast review" (i.e. in quotes, the intranet search gives me <em>no hits at all</em>...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534112441/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/2534112441_1b1ecdd378.jpg" alt="2008-05-29_2208" height="200" width="333" /></a></p>

<p>And what's the result?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534101817/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2534101817_b90c361c3a.jpg" alt="2008-05-29_2203" height="391" width="370" /></a></p>

<p>Hmm... I just repeated the search with <em>broadcast strategy review</em>, which got some hits, then repeated the <em>broadcast review</em> search - and it too gave some hits this time... crap ones, though... lots of docs titled <em>editable:doctitle</em> and <em>Working file</em>... WTF? Internal readers - here's the link: <a href="https://intranet-gw.open.ac.uk/bsr/index.php">http://intranet.open.ac.uk/bsr/index.php</a>. If you find the 'interactive' display as irritating as I do in navigational terms, here's the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/bsr/accessible/index.html">'accessible' version</a> which, errr, doesn't have links to the video clips, so you'll have to download and read the Word doc transcripts... sigh... Good job it's virtually impossible to find... and why, I wonder, isn't it public anyway...? Hmm - anyone fancy trying making an FOI request to get hold of the review 'report'?)</p>

<p>Anyway, where was I.... ah yes, the BBC Trust review... Here's what they said about education:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Education and learning</strong><br />
bbc.co.uk plays a vital role in contributing to this public purpose.</p>

<p>bbc.co.uk's Service Licence commits it to offering something of educational value to people of all ages through both formal and informal learning and a comprehensive service for children. Its output includes a broad range of formal and informal educational content for both children and adults.</p>

<p>The BBC has a strong formal learning portfolio online. The on-demand and personalisable characteristics of the internet make it more suited to the delivery of learning media than broadcast media in many ways and the BBC is increasingly focussing its formal learning activities online. For example, the BBC is progressively reducing the amount of schools programming broadcast on television and moving it online. </p>

<p>Another example is the BBC's long-running language teaching courses which are now delivered primarily online and are well-regarded by users.</p>

<p>Within the BBC Schools area, the BBC has two main formal education offers for children: Bitesize, which is heavily used by GSCE students in particular and Blast, which supports creative skills development. BBC Schools also provides teacher and parent support materials and other learning resources for children.</p>

<p>While we give some headline findings here, we will review the effectiveness of the BBC's formal learning offer for children and young people in more detail when we review BBC output for these audiences later this year.</p>

<p>The BBC's online formal learning areas have high volumes of use - BBC Schools is visited by an average of one million users each week, with GCSE Bitesize the mostpopular part of the offering. Bitesize's weekly usage ranges from around 399,000 in late 2007 to a peak of 650,000 in the GCSE revision period.</p>

<p>Adult learning sites, such as Skillswise and RaW, have lower overall volumes of usage but are used widely by adult education centres. These offerings are highly rated by their users, generating some very high Netpromoter scores.</p>

<p>Our public consultation demonstrated the value of these offerings to their users:</p>

<p>"bbc.co.uk is of great benefit to me personally and to my family. My children both make extensive use of it for research and revision and will increasingly do so as they prepare for GCSEs and beyond. It provides a source of reliable and trustworthy information targeted at the appropriate level for children and adults." BBC Trust public consultation</p>

<p>The Service Licence for bbc.co.uk needs to set out the BBC's online learning activities more clearly. While bbc.co.uk plays a key role in delivering this purpose, we have concluded that the current Service Licence for bbc.co.uk does not adequately reflect the scope of the BBC's formal and informal learning activities. We intend to amend the bbc.co.uk Service Licence following this review in order to set out more clearly the scope of BBC activities in this area.</p>

<p>The BBC's online content for children - via CBeebies and CBBC - is a clear strength. Both CBeebies and CBBC offer a blend of education and entertainment with content commissioned alongside television programming. CBeebies in particular receives very high quality and advocacy scores. Its average quality rating is above the average for bbc.co.uk and its Netpromoter score is over double the average. CBBC's quality and Netpromoter scores have been lower, particularly following a site relaunch which appears to have been received poorly by users</p>

<p>The BBC children's sites are amongst the most used in the UK - alongside fellow TV brands Nickelodeon and Disney. While the total level of usage has dropped slightly in the past year, our audience research and public consultation demonstrated how valued these offerings are by licence fee payers as sources of high quality, non-commercial, UK-originated content with clear educational goals. The BBC's online content for children will also be considered in more detail as part of our review of content and services for that audience later this year.</p>

<p>bbc.co.uk is highly valued by users as a resource for informal learning. This was one of the clearest findings from our public consultation and audience research.</p>

<p>"I looked up rubella on Google recently and it gave me all these links that were really scientific in their information and I just couldn't understand it. So then I went to the BBC website and it was really good, it had just the right amount of information and was easy to understand." Female aged 19-30, Belfast. Sparkler research</p>

<p>However, we believe its value could be increased even further by improved site navigation. Our audience research and public consultation suggest that many users are unaware of the full breadth of bbc.co.uk's offer, or that they have problems finding content they are looking for.</p>

<p>"There is loads of information on there that you just wouldn't know about, and you would end up using another site somewhere else to find it when the information is actually on the BBC site. So in that sense they are doing us a disservice by not telling us what is on the site." Male, aged 31-50, Belfast. Sparkler research</p>

<p>... We believe that the planned improvements to navigation and cross-site linking, as well as to the introduction of functions which allow search within audio and video content may greatly increase bbc.co.uk's contribution to the Education and learning purpose.</blockquote><br />
And also this on 'new media literacy':<br />
<blockquote>The promotion of digital media literacy is key to the Citizenship purpose. The BBC provides a number of offerings for basic digital media literacy on the well-established Webwise site. Webwise still has around 130,000 weekly users. In addition to this core offer, bbc.co.uk has also developed a number of projects targeting particular types of user: the WW2 People's War site was aimed at encouraging older adults to participate in an online project and CBBC's StaySafe provides advice on safe internet use to children.</p>

<p>BBC management's submission sets out four goals for bbc.co.uk in contributing to digital media literacy:</p>

<p>- to help people through digital media jargon<br />
- to encourage audiences to adopt emerging technologies and services encourage audiences to experiment creatively with digital media tools<br />
- and to provide advice to enable children to explore online content safely</p>

<p>As BBC management acknowledges, ongoing development of bbc.co.uk's media literacy offerings is vital in order to help the BBC contribute more fully to this public purpose. Encouraging more advanced forms of media literacy may be a suitable role for bbc.co.uk to adopt as internet penetration increases. MyCBBC, which aims to give children the skills and confidence they will need to interact online, is a good example of how the BBC's role in this area may evolve. As media literacy is a key priority within the BBC's Citizenship purpose, this should be a priority for bbc.co.uk. </p>

<p>The BBC's plans for improved support of BBC programmes and other online offerings will include more opportunities for audiences to form communities around BBC content. We expect that the future development of non-geographic communities should focus on areas where these can do most to contribute in a demonstrable way to the BBC's public purposes.</blockquote><br />
Something I'd completely forgotten about was that the BBC offers a web search facility (read more about it here: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/whysearch.shtml">BBC web search</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2534991870/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/2534991870_c3482fc7a9.jpg" alt="BBC web search" height="43" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The trust queried whether the BBC should remain in this game at all...<br />
<blockquote>The BBC's role in providing web search has never been clear. bbc.co.uk has had a search engine for some time, but its role in competing against other web search providers has remained unclear amongst internet users. The Graf review commented on the BBC's search engine:</p>

<p>"Respondents in our audience research could not clearly identify the value of the BBC search engine. Many were content with commercial tools such as Google. On balance, however, I feel the BBC should retain its search engine. Given that search is becoming such a fundamental part of how the internet is used, it is worth keeping a publicly funded UK competitor in the market place."</p>

<p>Our audience research and public consultation demonstrated that internet users still do not understand why the BBC offers web search.</p>

<p>"I have used bbc.co.uk as my homepage for some years now, but I always look elsewhere for access to the wider web." BBC Trust Consultation</p>

<p>We note that the BBC's search engine has a very low level of usage: it has around 3 million monthly users, compared with 28 million for Google and around 6 million each for Yahoo!, MSN Windows and Ask. We note also that it has a much lower average number of pages opened by users, compared to other search engines: an average of 4.7 pages per user, compared with 104 for Google, 32 for Yahoo! and 17 for MSN.</p>

<p>We have considered the role of the BBC in the web search market. In the context of a web search market which has become increasingly commercially attractive, we have considered whether there is a role for a public service search engine. We asked for additional information on the BBC's intended role in web search from BBC management and understand that its future is being debated and that there are currently no plans to develop it.</p>

<p>We will expect BBC management to take a clear decision on the future of the BBC's web search following this review. It is not clear to us how provision of web search falls within the BBC's remit. While Graf concluded that there was a role for a publicly funded UK web search provider, we are not convinced that this is a role the BBC can or should play, except for possibly in limited and well defined areas such as children's. We are asking BBC management to report to us on plans for its web search engine following this review and we will then report publicly on any decisions taken. </blockquote><br />
Do you think Microsoft is scared that the BBC might continue to offer a web search product? ;-)</p>

<p>More generally, <em>should</em> their be a public service search engine? Bear in mind this comment, also from the Trust review:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Personalisation</strong> may allow users to opt-out of consuming news on topics which are important but perhaps not very interesting to them, e.g. politics or foreign affairs. One of the benefits of a linear news bulletin is that the agenda can be mixed to ensure that a range of topics is covered. Given the BBC's duty to promote citizenship and civil society amongst all audiences, we do not believe it would be acceptable for the development of optional or personalised news to lead to an unduly narrow range of consumption. As bbc.co.uk's customisation develops, we will monitor the trend in reach of those editorial areas...</blockquote>So what about the populace being fed a diet of (personally biased?) news and other web content from the Goog...? Just asking...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bbctrust" rel="tag">bbctrust</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20bbc.co.uk" rel="tag"> bbc.co.uk</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>It's that time of year when the OU internal conference takes place (next week in fact) and this year the theme is "Making Connections" (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/making-connections/index.shtm">conference website</a>).</p>

<p>Trying to work out which parallel session to go to is a bit of a pain though... so given tag clouds are back in vogue, I wondered whether I could use them to help me decide which sessions to go to... </p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples (created by running a cut and paste of all the abstracts in a session through <a href="http://tagcrowd.com">TagCrowd</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Session 1A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2431061478/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2431061478_eed4504375.jpg" alt="making connections 1a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="257" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>... and the theme of the session? <em>Quality eLearning: New models for course design</em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Day 1 - Session 3A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2431062896/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2431062896_513f515677.jpg" alt="making connections 3a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="183" width="500" /></a></p>

<p><br />
... and the theme of the session? <em>Quality eLearning:  Using evaluations in quality eLearning </em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Day 1 - Session 5A</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2430252071/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2430252071_b4f64cb83e.jpg" alt="making connections 5a tagcrowd" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="195" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>... and the theme of the session? <em>Working with employers: The space between academe and practice</em></p>

<p><br />
This sort of representation could make for an interesting splash projection screen to announce each session?</p>

<p>Also conference related, and picking up on Martin's desire to use twitter or social glue in the new IET building (<a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/04/crowdstatus-and.html">Crowdstatus and filtered twitter</a>), I wonder whether conference foyer screens showing recent tweets from conference delegates might also be an interesting idea?</p>

<p>(Btw - anyone noticed how blog posting frequency appears to have gone down since twitter started hitting the edublogosphere? Do the stats bear this out, I wonder? Note to self - in annual appraisal meeting, suggest that over the next year I should increase the amount of conversations I have with interesting people in bars and cafes, as measured by the number of rounds of drinks I have purchased on expenses (i.e. my beveragarati ranking ;-))</p>

<p>PS anyone know what the Making Connections conference tag is?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cloud%20tag" rel="tag">cloud tag</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20conference" rel="tag"> conference</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>One of my favourite Google watching sites is <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>, a great site for keeping tabs on what's happening in the Googleverse. So tonight, whilst going for a ramble around the BBC website, I wondered whether there was an equivalent for the BBC?</p>

<p>For example, did you know:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.bbcactive.com/">BBC Active</a> ( formerly known as BBC Worldwide Learning, (includuing BBC Children's Learning and BBC Languages)) is now part of Pearson Education: "The partnership will be co-owned by Pearson Education and BBC Worldwide, with BBC Worldwide holding a minority stake, and will sit alongside Pearson's existing educational publishing businesses." <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/10_october/pearson_partnership.shtml">BBC Active signals new partnership for BBC Worldwide and Pearson Education</a>. (When I posted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012470.html">If Universities Were Companies</a>, and idly wondered whether Pearson might make a play for a struggling university, I had no idea they had been buying up chunks of the BBC since October 2005!)</li><br />
<li>the BBC Archive is up and running, albeit just on a single topic at the moment, as far as I can tell: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/titanic/">BBC - Archive - Titanic</a>;</li><br />
<li>whilst at the JISC conference, one of the BBC speakers quipped that the BBC wants to "own time"; as well as the lapsed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/default.stm">On This Day</a> minisite ("Video and audio from the BBC News archive WWII and 1950-2005. This site is archived and no longer updated."), the upcoming <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/memoryshare/">Memoryshare</a> would appear to be part of that play, a user submission site for capturing people's memories and popping them on a timeline. (I've covered some of the BBC's other timelime plays here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=bbc%20timeline">OUseful posts on BBC timelines...</a>);</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/">BBC Learning Zone</a> includes a growing <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/">clips library</a> featuring streamed clips from BBC schools programmes. At the moment, clips play in the BBC media player, rather than the iPlayer.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/04/bbc_iplayer_on_wii.html">iPlayer on the wii</a> - a bit slow when I tried it last week, maybe it's a bit quicker this week?</li></ul><br />
Anyway, until a "BBC blogscoped" site appears, here are a few feeds to keep tabs on:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/">BBC Radio Labs blog</a> - this is where I found out how to get <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/03/still_playing_in_the_cloud_1.shtml">'live text' over XMPP</a> (I had to get the geeky 'duh? wassat?' bit in somewhere!;-)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/">BBC Internet Blog</a>, "a place where senior staff from BBC Future Media teams will discuss issues about the technology behind bbc.co.uk, our mobile services and the BBC's presence on the internet."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC Backstage</a> - the BBC community developer area, and the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/">BBC Innovation Labs</a>...</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/nmfeeds/serve.pl/pressoffice.xml?cat=New%20Media">BBC Press Office - "New media" news announcements</a>.</li></ul><br />
PS here's a <a href="http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/BBC_Blogoscoped">BBC Blogoscoped OPML file</a>, and here's an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=hOQPBkHW2xGuVSF3jknRlg&_render=rss&opmlURL=http%3A%2F%2Fgrazr.com%2Fdata%2Fpsychemedia%2FBBC_Blogoscoped">aggregated BBC Blogsocoped RSS feed</a> generated by merging the contents of the separate blog feeds contained in the OPML feed.<br />

<p>Yesterday, I had a little tinker with a minimal OpenSocial widget for a Ning site that simply displayed a list of a users friends on Ning:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2398747235/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2123/2398747235_74207dfd0a.jpg" alt="opensocial" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="154" width="277" /></a></p>

<p>(See the widget code here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningOpenSocial1.xml">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningOpenSocial1.xml</a>)</p>

<p>I then tried to use the same app code to view my friends on Facebook using the <a href="http://www.opensocket.org/blog/">OpenSocket</a>  Facebook app that essentially implements an OpenSocial container within Facebook (see the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/opensocket/faq/contents.php">OpenSocket app on Facebook</a>).... but it didn't work...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://opensocket.org/gadgets/profilecollage.xml">OpenSocket demo/example code</a> worked fine in Facebook, and almost in Ning:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2398767047/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2398767047_9a76e3e518_o.png" alt="opensocial collage" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="189" width="188" /></a></p>

<p>If I ever have a free few minutes again, I'll tweak the image calls and see if I can get images to display in Facebook and on Ning using the same code!</p>

<p>I should maybe read the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial documentation</a> too....! As well as this <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/">Myspace Apps/OpenSocial Documentation</a>. Maybe the <a href="http://developer.bebo.com/">Bebo Developer docs</a>?</p>

<p>Anyway, as well as having to get a minimal, working OpenSocial friends widget together, here's what I don't undertsand...</p>

<p>OpenSocial is one jigsaw piece, Lego block, whatever..</p>

<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Google Social Graph API</a> may be another...</p>

<p>friendfeed is a third...</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2231/2398817913_408314afc2.jpg" alt="friendfeed" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="331" width="442" /></a></p>

<p>or rather, these bits: </p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia?output=opml" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/2399653482_137b228710.jpg" alt="friendfeed opml" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="196" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Or even more comprehensively, a foaf record of subscriptions on other services, and a user's followers within friendfeed:</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/psychemedia/subscriptions?output=foaf" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2403/2398828419_89f472b5e4.jpg" alt="friendfeed" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="224" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The friendfeed foaf file sets up all sorts of possible running round the web treasure hunts, of course...</p>

<p>For example, I can recurse my friends foaf feeds, and their friends foaf feeds etc; or if I have twitter authentication, I can go in to twitter via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation">twitter API</a>, pull off the twitter ID of <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/friends.xml">100 or so of my twitter friends</a>,  and then maybe guess that their twitter IDs are the same as their friendfeed IDs (though this isn't necessarily the case) - if they are, I can pull off their identities on other services via their friendfeed foaf file; or, I can just try to guess their identity on last.fm, delicious, etc assuming it's the same as their twitter id.</p>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>This grabbing of the social graph is all so easily achievable (and I guess the Google social graph API is already doing a chunk of it), but ... so what? I can almost but not quite feel what this could be really good for... certainly there are a lot of friend recommender services surfacing at the mo (e.g. I came across <a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/twitslikeme/">Twits Like Me</a> today), but that's not it... I figure the only way to grok it, is to try to build my way there (though it might go nowhere <em>and I have no idea where it would lead...</em>) But I have no time to play at the mo - far too much other crap to do, and I'm flagging before midnight each day now....arrrghhhh.....</p>

<p>PS this post is even more random than usual because I have just completely run out of time on....well, everything.... real projects and side projects alike! Back to Digital Worlds posts tomorrow - only another 8-10 weeks of it to go... ho hum...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social" rel="tag">social</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/api" rel="tag">api</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20confused" rel="tag"> confused</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20tip%20of%20my%20tongue" rel="tag"> tip of my tongue</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Just over a year ago now, I mentioned in a post on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010108.html">The Future of Music</a> that Nine Inch Nails appeared to have got into the habit of releasing versions of their songs as free Garageband 'source' files. Just recently, <a href="http://www.radioheadremix.com/information/">Radiohead</a> have started selling Garageband source files of their latest single (and REM have released free <a href="http://supernaturalsuperserious.com/">src movie files</a> for a video remix competition).</p>

<p>Checking back on the NIN site, with newly designed <a href="http://remix.nin.com">NIN remix area</a>, I notice this bit of blurb about <a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/remix/">Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D, the Year Zero remix album</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://yearzero.nin.com/remix/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2391914279_4191e70a7c.jpg" alt="NIN remix album" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="119" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(I love it when a prediction comes together... ;-)</p>

<p>Now, I don't know how long it took it took Brian Lamb to: a) find, and b) put together his <a href="http://media.nmc.org/2008/04/mashup-un-artist.mp3">Confessions of Mashup Unartist</a> masterpiece [<a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/045788.php">background info from the DJ himself</a>),  a veritable soundscape of a radio play, rather than a typical audio lecture, but it got me wondering whether or not he was going to release the src too?!</p>

<p>It also made me wonder - if I had any clue about a/v remix - how I would go about finding the resources, putting the mix together, and actually performing it? (I'm not saying I could do this - I'm saying, where would I think to start...)</p>

<p>I guess I'd look for audio by searching for words or phrases to sample using something like or <a href="http://www.podscope.com/">Podscope</a>, <a href=""></a> even <a href="http://audio.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's audio search</a>,  </p>

<p>The thing is, podcasts are maybe not authoritative enough? This could be though - <a href="http://www.spokenword.ac.uk/">Spoken Word Services</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Our core aim is to enhance and transform educational experience through the integration of digitised spoken word audio and video into learning and teaching.<br />
...<br />
We are attempting to make a substantial portion of the BBC’s radio archive accessible online for educational use ...</blockquote><br />
Here's more:</p>

<div style="width: 425px; text-align: left;" id="__ss_27608"><object style="margin: 0px;" height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc-3586"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc-3586" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="355" width="425"></object><div style="font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin-bottom: -5px;" alt="SlideShare" /></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BigRedBall/connecting-pasts-and-futures-spoken-word-services-and-the-bbc?src=embed" title="View 'Connecting Pasts and Futures: Spoken Word Services and the BBC' on SlideShare">View</a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload?src=embed">Upload your own</a></div></div>

<p>The British Library also make "12,000 selected recordings of music, spoken word, and human and natural environments" available through their <a href="http://sounds.bl.uk/">Archival Sounds Recordings Service</a>, although if you actually try to listen to the content or do anything with it out of the gaze of the Copyright Police, they'll have to shoot you... ("This is an audio resource for UK higher and further education. Anyone can search or browse the information on this site. For copyright reasons, only people in licensed UK higher and further education institutions, or in our reading rooms, can play the recordings. Downloading is available in licensed institutions.").</p>

<p>For anyone into info skills, here's a query to the internet archive that sould make your heart glow: <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:audio%20AND%20collection:opensource_audio%20AND%20/metadata/subject:%22Spoken%20Word%22">http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:audio AND collection:opensource_audio AND /metadata/subject:"Spoken Word"</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to the idea of mashup unartistry, several video shorts by John Monk, a colleague here at the OU, also come to mind...</p>

<p><object height="366" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFOItcYcdFQ6B-A5swgOqJ8X4TCh-Jav0g8="><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/cp/vjVQa1PpcFOItcYcdFQ6B-A5swgOqJ8X4TCh-Jav0g8=" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="366" width="425"></object></p>

<p>The point being? Finding a short piece of audio and annotating it with images might be an easy way in to a first a/v mashup...?</p>

<p>Performance wise, I always liked the idea of a <a href="http://www.pandia.com/sew/237-google-jockeying-%E2%80%93-search-engines-in-the-classroom.html">google jockey</a> supplementing a presentation with up to the minute, relevant examples? (Or maybe a guerrilla google jockey using a backchannel to twitter counterfactuals and reminders of previous policy commitments in realtime in a political debate?!)</p>

<p>That said, to really push the boat out, a live vj mix could be, err, different?! (I really should have a play with <a href="http://www.vjamm.com/">VJamm</a> or the <a href="http://www.neuromixer.com/product-avdrum.php">Neuromixer AVdrum</a>, which looks kinda fun (if dated)!)</p>

<p>Ho hum, what fun it must be to be a kid today...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/remix" rel="tag">remix</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/av" rel="tag">av</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mashup" rel="tag"> mashup</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20madness" rel="tag"> madness</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">To Comrades in Non-Programistan - A Message from Feedistan</h3>

To my comrade friends in Non-Programistan, As we approach the third naked CSS day, your declaration of independence based on the founding principles of Friendliness, Openness and Portability brings much hope to the workers here in Feedistan, who have struggled...
<!--
<p>To my comrade friends in Non-Programistan,</p>

<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3174/2391150046_3a06955b03.jpg" width="500" height="110" alt="non-programisatn" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>As we approach the <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">third naked CSS</a> day, your <a href="http://bionicteaching.com/ihatecode/">declaration of independence</a> based on the founding principles of Friendliness, Openness and Portability brings much hope to the workers here in Feedistan, who have struggled with bringing feeds to the attention of the masses for many years now.</p>

<p>It is a Good Thing that you have done this week and one that I am sure will be rewarded by many fruitful harvests.</p>

<p>I hear tales from many sources that workers from the death camps of Semantic Formalism and Ontologica, that are hidden down dead-ends in many academic temples around the world, are also revolting.</p>

<p>As I write, the Semantic Brethren of the Order of RDF (and - a sore point for a sick man -  I do not mean the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/radicaldancefaction">Radical Dance Faction</a> here) are parading their way down one way streets, into blind alleys that stink of rotten red herrings, whilst pigs that might, do, fly, actually, over the spires of their ivory towers, inside of which, the gorillas in the room are incorrectly identified as white elephants by pragmatic semanticists who are confused by the syntax and the strange use of otherwise everyday vocabulary and frequent commas, not to say overlong sentences likely to score highly (that is, poorly) on even the most academically biased readability scales.</p>

<p>Already, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGcsGPgUTw">protest songs</a> are being smuggled out and workers seeking to find ways to release data, the mined children of data, and the remixed children of the mined children of data that have all been imprisoned since they were first born.</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eGcsGPgUTw&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eGcsGPgUTw&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>Even the current, venerable <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2008/04/03/iwr-information-professional-of-the-year-2007-article-in-panlibus/">I-Were-I-Poty</a> has started to use artworks to smuggle pictures of the <a href="http://animoto.com/play/e528929409157c05e8f5018751049017">war on terror</a> out of Institutionalia.</p>

<p>Despite your great achievement, let us not forget that all is not well elsewhere in the world, particularly in the <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/03/50reasons.jpg">50 states of Cantdothat</a> and around the foothills of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1805565187/in/set-72157602805227511/">Towers of WS-Babel</a>.</p>

<p>In the shallow waters of ScreenScraperica, fishermen struggle in often turbulent and polluted waters in their search for staple informational needs. We are most gracious for the way in which many of them engage in free trade with Feedistan. (Did you know Yahoo Pipes has ScreenScraperican ancestry on the DataBlock side?)</p>

<p>We encourage polluters of the world to think carefully before publishing contaminated HTML, and instead embrace both the CSS- and X-factors, as well as the clean simplicity of the microformat elixir.</p>

<p>In the PLE jihad, believers are struggling even as we speak to manage their data according to their own beliefs in both Institutionalia and The Cloud - we wish them every success in their mission. Here in Feedistan, we have every confidence that they Cann succeed, as weller. They have many supporters, some who have already publicly revealed themselves, some of whom may do sclater.</p>

<p>In these unsettled times, where <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>, I would urge caution in too hastily blacklisting those whom you perceive as enemies of the state of Non-Programistan.</p>

<p>In Feedistan, all Apparati that consume or produce RSS feeds are welcome, although those that both produce and consume feeds find most favour.</p>

<p>In Feedistan, we agree with not only with the founding principles of Non-Programistan, but also some of the principles of Programistan, which borders on Feedistan also.</p>

<p>Whenever necessary, Feedistan puts to work technology liberated from Programistan. We hope to move forward with them in them in the future through blackbox techniques they have shared with us, in part, through the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014014.html">United Libraries of Progressive Enhancement</a>.</p>

<p>We believe that a universal failing in the educational systems across the landscape has led in part to the widespread ignorance of the state religion of Programistan, and the intolerance many people have for it.</p>

<p>We support the arts of all countries, and are currently seeking an artist capable of bringing light to the black art of regular expressionism  to help promote this most powerful of transformational technologies.</p>

<p>We believe in the ritual cleansing brought forth by the <a href="http://media.nmc.org/2008/04/mashup-un-artist.mp3">Confessions of a Mashup Un-Artist</a> and encourage the telling of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo">Fair(y) Use Tale[s]</a> to our chidren, and our children's children, as they play freely and grazr on the Creative Commons.</p>

<p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object></p>

<p>In Feedistan, we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Non-Programistan, in our shared mission to bring the most precious data and content to the masses, wherever it is located, so that it can be put to work whensoever by whomsoever may have need or use of it, whether in public or in private.</p>

<p>Let us rise up together and with the truths of OLDaily at our side, fight the forces of Closed Protocols &amp; Data Formats, Installed Software, and Platform Speciifc Applications. Let us hope for a period of standards reconciliation in the Browser Wars, and pray that what looks like a tidal wave of migration from Online Appalachia to the nascent Offline Browser App territories will not cause too much bloodshed.</p>

<p>In RESTful friendship, comrades,</p>

<p>Your humble servant,</p>

<p>A peasant worker from Feedistan</p>

So what? Well.... apart from the fact that if you're really quick you might still be able to register for the webinar series, I think I might be tempted to start exploring this podcasting lark, a bit... err... maybe... ;-)

<h3 class="title">YUI Sortable Data Tables</h3>

I've been meaning to hava play with the YUI Library data tables for some time, so I had a quick play just now to see how easy it was to style a legacy HTML data table - and it's trivial....
<!--
<p>I've been meaning to hava  play with the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI Library data tables</a> for some time, so I had a quick play just now to see how easy it was to style a legacy HTML data table - and it's trivial.</p>

<p>I scraped together a table showing the budgets of Isle of Wight Primary schools (using data found on the <a href="http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/the_lea/finance/formulaf.asp">eduwight</a> website, specifically), along with their fate under each of the three options the Isle of Wight Council has slated for them in the current schools reorganisation plan, to go along with the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012526.html">Google maps view of Proposed School Closure Plans on the Isle of Wight</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2215050995/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2420/2215050995_51e6712d59.jpg" alt="2008-01-24_0207" style="border: 0pt none ; width: 649px; height: 269px;" /></a></p>

<p>You can find the table at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/schoolsDataPrimary.html">Table of Primary School Budgets</a>. Click on the heading of any table to sort the table on that column (either increasing or decreasing - just keep clicking;-)</p>

<p>All I had to do to make the table sortable was include the YUI datatable libraries, and a handful lines of code in the page containing a simple HTML marked up table.</p>

<p>As it uses YUI components, I'm hoping that it'll work on all browsers:-)</p>

<p>The next thing I want to try out is <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/01/17/tables-and-charts/" title="Permanent Link to Automatic conversion from simple, accessible data tables to YUI Charts">Automatic conversion from simple, accessible data tables to YUI Charts</a>, which does exactly what it says on the tin - it generates a YUI chart from a data table, automagically...</p>

<p>...but I'm not sure that the school budget data would really make sense viewed that way, so I won't try it with that data just now...(plus it's late, and I really should go to bed!)</p>

<p>PS though I'm sure there's nothing in this, a quick tally of cost savings (using the figures I found) and child places lost (according to 2007 attendance figures) are as follows: option 1: (10,424,081, and 3186 places), option 2: (15,488,947, and 4727 places), option 3: (10,530,348, and 3164 places).<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/yui" rel="tag">yui</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/data%20table" rel="tag">data table</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>I've missed out on the news over the last few days, so driving home tonight I was wondering whether any decisions had been taken about the possible nationalisation of the Northern Rock Bank, and considering what the government response would be if a university was in immediate danger of going under?</p>

<p>(The OU is currently looking at an "<a href="http://www.backtheou.com/">ELQ funding gap</a>", in which the OU is set to lose out on a significant chunk of funding council fee income from adult students (lifelong learners...) taking conversion or second degrees, but I don't think things are that bad yet...! So this is just a "what if...";-)</p>

<p>Flipping the 'nationalisation of the Northern Rock' idea round, I wondered whether one radical solution might be the privatisation, or buyout, of a university by a public or private company, or private equity? Private capital already has a stake in the UK educational system, not only through "public schools" (i.e. private, fee-paying schools) but also through the <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/resourcesfinanceandbuilding/FSP/schoolsprivatefinanceinitiative/">Schools Private Finance Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>And what sort of organisation would want to add a university to their portfolio anyway?</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/oct/01/bbc.business">BBC Worldwide bought out travel publisher Lonely Planet</a> - but I can't really imagine any good reasons why they would want to take over a traditional university...</p>

<p>Or would it make sense for an educational publisher to consider making a play?</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/05/15/ecollege%20">Pearson bought eCollege</a>, a course management/distance learning service provider, presumably as a conduit for pushing their content to academic users in the US HE sector. But would there be any advantage in them adding a traditional university to their portfolio? (I can see how it could make sense for them to add a distance learning provider, maybe?)</p>

<p>Nature Publishing Group may be doing all sorts of innovative things in scientific publishing, but I couldn't really see them wanting to buy up a university, splitting off the research arm and selling the teaching part on!</p>

<p>Hmm - would it make sense for someone like Qinetiq to do that, though, absorb what bits of the research they can and use the teaching wing as competition to <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/locations/shrivenham/index.jsp">RMCS</a>?! ;-)</p>

<p>How about a conference centre provider? Many universities offer conferencing facilities of course, but how about if the tables turned and the campus was primarily for conferencing with student services as the secondary funding stream. (Same for property rental - particularly if the property company did a deal with someone who needed access to cheap undergrad labour! It could almost become like a <a href="http://chau84.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/corporate-empires-shirking-their-social-responsibilities/">modern day academic factory town</a>!)</p>

<p>Having got the idea of a university being "just another company",&nbsp; my mind then started wandering around the idea of universities buying up companies to further their aims. Certainly, many universities support science and innovation parks, spin-off start-ups to exploit IPR created research, and provide commercial consultancy services, but how many of them actually buy up other companies (in the UK at least)?</p>

<p>Again, thinking back to the Beeb Worldwide and Lonely Planet (a 'news and culture tourism' play, maybe?!;-), what sort of fit - or reason - might there be for a corporate wing of a university to start taking over "real", already established companies?</p>

<p>I suspect that many university presses have little to do with the parent university any more, so I guess that a university taking over a publisher would make little sense (even setting aside the fact that the turnover of individual universities is dwarfed by that of the large publishers).</p>

<p>But whilst I can't really imagine a web company wanting to buy up a university, would it make sense for a university with global online learning aspirations to consider buying up a web company?</p>

<p>Maybe... but what sort of property would make sense? A social network? A content sharing site? An application provider? A web service platform of some sort? Wikipedia?!</p>

<p>Again last year, <a href="http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/content2/20051014001848">Blackboard acquired Web CT</a>. But what would it have meant if a university had bought them out (or equally, if a university had bought out eCollege?)</p>

<p>Ho hum - the boat's getting in, so time to sign off for now and then post this when I get back home...</p>

<p>It strikes me, coming back from the break, that I can keep up in retrospect with what (some) of my online 'friends' and colleagues were up to over the holiday season by looking at&nbsp; the their tweets and Facebook status streams.</p>

<p>Rather than indulging in the post-holiday question-response ritual of "what did you do over the break?", "we went to , visited y, did z for New Year", I can join the conversation already running, by looking at their recorded present ("P tweets: just off to q for r").</p>

<p>It also occurs to me that I don't necessarily need to have a camera to have a photographic record of family visits and events any more...</p>

<p>Imagine this scene, familiar to many, I'd guess:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, would you mind taking a photo of us, please...?" One hand gestures round a small family group, the other offers a camera. "It's just point and click." Points: "here".</p>

<p>Now consider this:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing you have a camera." Smiles. "Do you use flickr by any chance?" Another smile provides the answer: "Yeah - all the time". "Would you mind taking a picture of us and tagging it with today's date and location?" "Sure, no problem - do you want all of you in the photo...?"</p>

<p>If an email comes with an attachment, then I suspect that in a large number of cases the sender is probably using the wrong medium. So for example, this morning I found in my mailbox:<br />
<blockquote>Three seminar announcements with *ALL* the details in an attached word file (nothing in the body of the message). ("Please find enclosed details of our next seminar" - you know the sort of thing...)</p>

<p>Two newsletters as PDF attachments (they're available on the web as well...)</p>

<p>And a flurry of emails representing forwarded messages from other applications (my own fault...)<br />
</blockquote><br />
So I think I may try a new mail rule: <br />
<ul><li>if attachment then</li><ul><li>silently delete AND<br />
</li><li>reply-to-sender "Please find another way of letting me see the document you sent as an enclosure - I do have a browser, you know... If the document is for commenting on by several people, try Google docs, Zoho, or Microsoft Live whatever it's called..."</li></ul></ul>Now I know my own email practice is lousy, but I am trying to work on it...</p>

<p>So for example, I quite often mail people links, which can probably be annoying at times...</p>

<p>...so I'm working hard on getting people to set up a delicious account, subscribe to the "<a href="http://del.icio.us/help/for">links for you</a>" feed, and then I can share links with them using the delicious <em>for:</em> tag.</p>

<p>That said, I'm starting to find I now need a level of indirection, in that I can't remember people's delicious names and I need to find a way of getting nicknames to work... so if you know of a flock extension that lets me create an address book for for: tagging people using the flock bookmark tool, please let me know :-)</p>

<p>(For more on delicious, this is interesting: Jon Udell "<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/12/12/discovering-versus-teaching-principles-of-social-information-management/">Discovering versus teaching principles of social information management</a>"</p>

<p>One important thing to note from the point of view of this post is if we both have delcious accounts, we can send bookmarks to each other...</p>

<p>Ever since i came across the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007032.html">Popup project</a>, (which in turn became <a href="http://fotowoosh.com">Fotowoosh</a>), a technology for 'flying around' inside a photograph, I've been waiting for the software to be released... and it seems that now it is available...</p>

<p>...as a Facebook app: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotowoosh/">Fotowoosh in Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://facebook.fotowoosh.com/public/view/2175884570216859230">an example fotowoosh view</a> "I've" just created:</p>

<p><object height="225" width="300"><param name="movie" value="http://wooshes.fotowoosh.com/wooshes/05/6/2/50661/2175884570216859230.swf"><param name="autostart" value="false"><embed src="http://wooshes.fotowoosh.com/wooshes/05/6/2/50661/2175884570216859230.swf" loop="false" autostart="false" height="300" width="400"></object><br />
<a href="#" style="color: black;" onclick="javascript:history.go();">Play embedded version again</a></p>

<p>Now, I'm not a photographer, and I didn't have any photos easily to hand on this computer, so I paid a quick visit to flickr looking for a Creative Commons licensed photo I could remix, and came up with that one - this one - of the local village: "Nice Street in Brading" by Hembo Pagi (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hembo/375478709/">see it on flickr</a>):</p>

<p><img style="width: 211px; height: 211px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/375478709_1ae3b2915e.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" /></p>

<p>A quick upload to my Facebook account (using the <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> People sidebar and photo uploader, of course...), select it in the fotowoosh Facebook app, 5 mins of backend processing on their server and fotowoosh..................</p>

<p>Desktop computer and games console slideshows (together with the Ken Burns effect) have a lot to answer for in terms of surfacing old photos on a day-to-day basis... I can see this technique quickly being added to the photo slideshow presentation palette and bringing those old digital photos alive even more...</p>

<p>PS the way the service appears to have been released was interesting, I thought... I got an email from the fotowoosh 'keep me updated' mailing list saying the fotowoosh Facebook app was now available. I've been watching the blogosphere - and the fotowoosh website - on and off for news of the public launch for ages, so for that launch to be revealed by email and delivered in Facebook is, err, a sign of something...?</p>

<p>PPS It's maybe worth noting that you can now <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/12/05/edit-your-photos-on-flickr/">edit your photos on flickr using Picnik</a>...</p>

<p>PPPS for more visions of the future of photography, as realised today, check out my <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/full_screen/?channel_code=GIPJ3220JF">Future of Photography</a> Splashcast channel... This post on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010811.html">Future of Estate Agents</a> probably also needs updating with the fotowoosh news...<br />

<!--
<p>Although I've been aware of unconferences for some time, I got to attend my first one over the last couple of days courtesy of an invite from <a href="http://dfflanders.wordpress.com/">David Flanders</a> of the  <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/CRIG">JISC Common Repository Interfaces Working Group</a>. Whilst I'm not involved with any repository projects in the OU - and wouldn't necessarily have thought of myself as a member of the repositories community! - it was surprising how many people I actually recognised there (as well as getting to meet a couple of people whose blogs I follow :-)</p>

<p>Unlike traditional conferences, where attendees get to stand on soapboxes and deliver by death by PowerPoint, the <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/CRIG_Unconference">CRIG Unconference</a> was based around several half-hour unsessions, each of which was split into three discussion areas, focussed around flip charts spaced 5 or metres apart. <em>The Law of Two Feet</em> was adopted as a house rule: "Any person neither learning from nor contributing to a group discussion must walk (or move) to another one (aka 'law of mobility')." In addition, everyone was supplied with a pen and everyone had an equal right to write on the chart.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>Additional flip charts around the room meant that breakaway groups from the main discussion themes in each unsession were 'allowed' to form, though that didn't seem to happen much(?) - I think the placement of the flipcharts is probably an important factor: having to walk to the other side of the room to reach a breakout chart was a big step to take, and not at all the same as walking a short ditance from one group clustered around a chart to another. (I wonder whether putting 10 or so flip charts in a circle a meter or two apart would have eased the formation of splinter groups (though whether that ould have been desirable is another matter!)?</p>

<p>One thing I hadn't picked up on was that the outcome of each theme in each unsession activity was intended to be a scenario or a challenge (I think that's right?) - I guess that was covered in the initial briefing during the first half day of the event, which I had to miss unfortunately.</p>

<p>(The unconference started for me at its private party, in an upstairs room at a nearby hostelry. As well as beer and food laid on, flipchart paper and pens were evindence there too... Taking the line that most of the real innovative dicsussion gets done in a traditional conference in the bar, the unconference made the evening social a continuation of the day's activities, albeit in a more informal setting and without prior guidane on discussion themes. And being geeks together, we like talking techie stuff <em>all</em> the time, right?)</p>

<p>The unconference 'officially' finished with a 'minute madness' (?) one minute review of each chart by a member of the group who had a part in creating it, and round of <a href="http://www.dotmocracy.org/">dotmocracy</a>, something I am familiar with (we use it a lot in OU meetings, although in a less elaborate form). The idea? We each had 9 sticky dots - three 'green for go', three yellow "take care', and three red 'no way' ones, which we had to place on points or ideas on the charts placed around the room. The scenarios and challenges highlighted by the group decision making process will - I assume - be used to inform the future activities of the CRIG. To make follow up easier, each of us initialled the group charts we'd each had a hand in contributing to.</p>

<p>(Just by the by, an interesting observation made by David, as compere, was that after a quick review of the ideas from the Friday sessions, most of the issues had arisen and been flagged during the evening social session the night before.)</p>

<p>Day's end, and the unconference unended in the bar, where conversations continued and new threads began, including one around the neat sounding <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">Myth TV personal PVR</a> project...;-)</p>

<p>PS if anyone from the unconference is happening by this blog for the first time, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">OpenLearn XML Asset Stripper</a> will maybe be of interest to you... I'll be updating it and posting about it in a bit more detail in the next week or two...</p>

<!--
<p>The Edublog Awards seem to have <a href="http://edublogawards.com/now-lets-be-fair/">had</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/love-your-teacher-a-bit-too-much/">a</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/institutional-voting-now-not-possible/">few</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/now-to-make-things-a-little-more-exciting/">difficulties</a> with their polls, suggesting that PollDaddy is maybe not up to supporting any polls other than throw away ones, or ones where no-one has a stake in the result?</p>

<p>I've not really looked at polls before - or the various ways (if any) of configuring PollDaddy polls - and comments bantering and brainstorming around the topic don't seem to be welcome on one particular website I can think of ;-), but a couple of things struck me:</p>

<p>1) there maybe needs to be just a little friction in the system, so that voters vote because they mean it; I've done several outreach events over the years where pre-booking was required and a commitment fee was levied to discourage people who had no intention of turning up - i.e. who had no stake in the event - taking up places; (the people who were 'cheating' in the EduBlog voting have demonstrated passion and commitment, if nothing else - maybe their votes should stand? ;-)</p>

<p>2) you need to think about what the voting units are - one person, one vote; one institution, one vote; etc. up front, and not keep moving the goal posts once the race has started (to mix wotsits and doo dahs...) Alternatively, maybe <a href="http://psychemedia.corank.com/">nomic voting</a> would be quite fun, where people are encouraged to suggest changes to how the votes are counted and calculated?</p>

<p>I don't know what the solution to the EduBlog Award voting palaver is, but I did start wondering what a 30 minute mashup polling solution might be, cobbled together out of tools and techniques familiar to bloggers...</p>

<p>... and my first attempt would include the following ingredients:</p>

<p>a) use of a <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">Captcha</a> or Typepad/OpenId login to provide a bit of friction to the affair, and cut down on the number of bot votes;<br />
b) use of a web stats tool to count unique visitors to a page that can only be reached via the Captcha;&nbsp; like Google analytics, perhaps, which will track unique visitors to a particular goal page, if you ask it nicely.</p>

<p>Alternatively, maybe there's a way of finessing a feed so that the number of people subscribing it could be interpreted as votes (the act of subscription providing the friction, in this case)? (Yes - I know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011961.html">accurately measuring the number of feed subscribers is a pain</a>.)</p>

<p>I'd have a tinker with both of these approaches to see if a quick proof of concept is possible (or not), but Spooks is about to start...;-)</p>

<p>Disclaimer - this blog (<span style="font-style: italic;">OUseful.info</span>) has been (err, <span style="font-style: italic;">had been</span>?;-) <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012041.html">nominated</a> in this year's EduBlog Awards... Voting is currently claimed to be open until December 6th - unless they close it before the announced deadline to catch people sniping votes in the last few minutes, eBay style...?!;-)</p>

<!--
<p>It's been an expensive week for us for cars: both have been in of attention this week, and I've just got back from giving our local garage several hundred quid...</p>

<p>I also suspect from a tweet from Marc Eisenstadt (<a href="http://eisenstadt.wordpress.com/">Eisenblog</a>) last night that he'll been spending the first day of his retirement at his local garage...</p>

<p>So it goes... Marc's leaving do was today, and whilst I couldn't make it in to MK, I did manage to catch the event via a KMi Stadium webcast.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I had been there, here's a couple of thing's I'd have recollected...</p>

<p>My first memory of Marc was when I was interviewed for a PhD place in HCRL, the OU's Human Cognition Research Lab which predated KMi. I think I got the post because I mentioned I had spent the previous couple of years as a band promoter, with my spare time spent in the York University library reading the AI literature.</p>

<p>Whilst I didn't really know Marc that well in HCRL, I do remember the atmosphere being a friendly one. After one particular summer school, Hank Kahney effectively became my mentor, and some could say, my fashion adviser... ;-) </p>

<p>From what I recall, Hank's last - unfinished - project was looking at standardising assessment marking, where he realised that getting non-subject matter experts to look at a script and just give it a mark based on how good it looked was actually more consistent than getting experienced tutors in the subject to mark the scripts according to an 'agreed upon' marking guide! (Hank also used to do a great summer school talk explaining to students how to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. One slide showed two poles and one disc, with the hint condition: "move the disc from one pole to the other":-)</p>

<p>In the final year of my PhD, HCRL upped sticks and became part of KMi. Only a couple of us were left behind in that move, and I've spent the 10 years or so since then trying to find a way in ;-)</p>

<p>When I returned to the OU after a couple of years as a postdoc, Marc's was one of the friendly faces to say hi to (I used to go visiting friends there for coffee quite regularly). We also crossed paths in the strangest of places - like a wet summer's day at the Eden Project in Cornwall, for example...</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hockeyshooter/58999219/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/31/58999219_d573647525.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" style="" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In the last two to three years I've chatted to Marc increasingly regularly, first by email, and now more and more via IM. I never really grokked IM, but Marc's persistence in evangelising it - and the presence technology around it - finally paid off!</p>

<p>Marc's openness to ideas is one of the reasons why this OUseful.info blog exists - and why many of the half-baked ideas reported in it appear at all. His 'just do it" attitude is going to be sorely missed in the OU I think?</p>

<p>I'm also going to lose a wonderful internal source of useful info... Marc is one of the great evangelisers of KMi technologies, so with his departure, I don't know who I'm going to have to talk to now to find out what cool stuff is going on over there... (that said, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/">Alex Little's blog</a> is shaping up nicely ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway - here's to you, Marc - sorry I couldn't be there in person to toast your retirement; it's been a privilege bouncing ideas around with you, and I hope you keep in touch. Maybe if you're sailing around the Solent, we could meet up for a coffee or swift half?;-)</p>

<p>PS Marc - does that totally black keyboard of yours have a single key that generates multiple exclamation marks at one press!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<!--
<p>Who's responsible for fixing broken links on an intranet website? Not the visitor, that's for sure - but how often <em>are</em> you made to feel responsible, as if the broken link was in some way <em>your</em> fault..?</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I clicked on a link from one OU intranet page to a page on another OU subdomain (for example, it went from "intranet.open.ac.uk/thisPage.html" to "iet.open.ac.uk/thatPage.cfm").</p>

<p>The link was broken, so good citizen that I am I reported it to the owner of the <em>second</em> page telling them where I had found the broken link in the first place.</p>

<p>My thinking was this: if the page existed once and was moved, a permanant redirect could be put in place; as we all work for the same institution (?!), the owner of the second page can tell the owner of the first page where the link should point to; the error page was horrible and made it look like maybe the error was my fault - maybe it could be replaced with something friendlier? And finally, the error page told me to report the error, although it didn't provide an email link or a form to make that reporting easy...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2088/2068995702_432b3ada11.jpg?v=0" alt="IET unfriendly error page" /></p>

<p>The response was as expected  - "the link's not ours, so it's not our fault. I'll pass it on to the page owner, harrumph".</p>

<p>I just tried the original intranet page again, and the link on it is still broken (it's the link to the CREET website on this <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/strategic-research-investment/#p4">intranet page</a>; hovering over the title of the Centre <em>looks</em> like it's a link, but it isn't; the link is below the centre description ;-). The error page is a little friendlier now, and if you're into such things, you'd notice it as a <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/custom-error-page-tips-designate-the-pages-you-hope-no-one-sees/">customised 404 page</a> ;-) It also includes a link to report the error (so I did.... again...)</p>

<p>Now I know that there are all sorts of issues about what to do with error reports like this, but I can't believe there isn't a better way to try and repair broken links on an intranet - or inter-intranet (you know, a set of internal, inerconnected networks within the same organisation).</p>

<p>When the server receives a request for a page, and it can't find the page, it generates an  internal error that can be used to present the user with a particular error page, which may be humourous, or may be pretty bland.</p>

<p>It can also tell whether the request came from a user clicking on link on another web page, as well as the location of that page. So it could in principle generate a report for the owner of that referring site telling them that one of their pages contains a broken link, and would they like to chat about it...</p>

<p>Or of course, you could just let the links continue to rot...</p>

<h3 class="title">That "Mailbox Full" Problem - It's Not Always the Fault of Email</h3>

A recent flurry of posts in the OU blogosphere (What Mailbox limits reveal, Your mailbox is over its size limit!, email must go!) about overflowing email mailboxes - the result of a multiway sharing of document we all happen to...
<!--
<p>A recent flurry of posts in the OU blogosphere (<a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/11/what-mailbox-li.html">What Mailbox limits reveal</a>, <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=91">Your mailbox is over its size limit!</a>, <a href="http://openpad.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/email-must-go/">email must go!</a>) about overflowing email mailboxes - the result of a multiway sharing of document we all happen to be working on as a part of an internal innovation project - reveals not so much about the nature of email, but more about how we use <em>documents</em>.</p>

<p>The problem is this - a team of ten or so are commenting on a document; with images, changes and comments, the file size is about 10MB large. Whenever anyone makes a change or comment, the edited doc is mailed round - again - to everyone on the circulation list.</p>

<p>Comments made to a document that becomes a the 'live' version - i.e. the one that gets edited and passed around - get to be seen repeatedly, each time the document is opened; commenting in an email message itself may or may not be read, may or may not be integrated into the document; which makes posting that sort of comment a risky strategy...<br />
   <br />
Does anyone else see the flaw in this approach? Passing the document around for edits and commentary by several people?</p>

<p>For example, why aren't we using something like Google docs or Zoho Writer (especially given that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/11/25/zoho-writer-now-lets-you-edit-documents-offline/">Zoho Writer now lets you edit documents offline</a>...).</p>

<p>In the post <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/document-vs-web-document/">Document vs Web Document</a> on the Zoho blog, the following image appears:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1271/800317748_94e4d1adf2.jpg" align="middle" /></p>

<p>(Collaboration around online, web documents is further explored in the post <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/web-apps-collaboration-the-big-picture/"> Web Apps &amp; Collaboration: The Big Picture</a>.)</p>

<p>The actuality, of course, is that <em>several</em> instances of each version of the document are created and downloaded from email attachments by each recipient.</p>

<p>For a couple of years now, I've thought that something like wikimail, or officemail was a possibly useful innovation in this area. Maybe it's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005488.html">an idea worth revisiting?</a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wikimail" rel="tag">wikimail</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag">email</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20officemail" rel="tag"> officemail</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Defining &quot;Broadcasting"</h3>

<!--
<p>After a month or so of light blogging while he was away, Martin has just posted some <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEdTechie/~3/181083647/a-lexicon-for-t.html">linkbait</a> to try and recover some of his lost technorati ranking points (can you <em>guess</em> what a <em>twintle</em> is before you read jhis post? ;-)</p>

<p>This 'floating of terms' is something I was having a sideways think about earlier today... I'd been writing up some notes having read the OU's Broadcast Strategy Review (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/cau/broadcast-strategy/">internal link</a>) and couldn't really unpack from that document what they thought broadcasting was (there's a philosophical treatment on the nature of broadcast on the website...)<br />
 <br />
So here's my first pass attempt at a definition of the 'new broadcast':<br />
<blockquote>a means of transmission/publication within which the marginal cost of distributing content to additional consumers of that content tends towards zero, and the marginal cost to the consumer of receiving additional broadcast materials, having acquired the broadcast receiver and, if necessary, paid for access to the carrier, tends to zero</blockquote></p>

<p>Invoking <em>marginal cost</em> tries to get across the idea that once the transmission equipement and receivers are in place, and a free carrier exists between them, there is no cost to adding more consumers of the content that is being broadcast, and no cost to receiving more content, unless payment is required to access the content. (There may also be a distribution/carrier cost - such as the fee for your broadband connection. But if it is 'unlimited' use, it's marginal as you consume more content).</p>

<p>There's a little more jargon in there that needs unpacking - this is based on something I scribbled 5 or 6 years ago now - a 3 layer model incorporating content, channels, and a carrier.<br />
<ul><li>at the top level is content: content refers to the actual programme you are watching - Friends, say;</li><br />
<li>at the middle level is the channel: the channel here refers literally to the programme channel providing the programme you are watching - Sky One, for example;</li><br />
<li>at the bottom level is the carrier: the carrier refers to the means by which the programming is delievered to your television set - cable, satellite, terrestrial broadcasting etc.</li></ul></p>

<p>There's lots of issues with the 'definition', (and the 3 -layer model...) such as that it admits all forms of content rather than just audio and video transmissions; but on the upside, it does accommodate novel distribution channels, including viral ones (where the consumers themselves become part of the transmission apparatus).</p>

<p>Things like newspapers are ruled out of being a broadcast medium (it costs to print another newspaper), but admittedly the whole of web publishing IS admitted ;-)</p>

<p>Scheduling (and to a lesser extent, simultaneous viewing) is another feature of the traditional broadcast view, but what that allowed was discoverability of known item content. Search and other navigation techniques, as well as syndication feed subscription models, meet the same need?</p>

<p>Viral transmission is interesting - here the consumers become part of the transmission and discovery system. Viral marketing is also similar to 'water cooler' discussions about last night's tv, except in this case if you missed the thing being talked about , you CAN go and watch it and become part of the discussion. So i don't have to preempt my viewing to be able to chat with you - we can negotiate the content we are going to talk around...</p>

<p>I bounced the definition passed <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc</a> (I don't think he liked it much ;-) but he did suggest I could try it out by adding it to the Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>...</p>

<p>I have to admit I hadn't thought of this (nor did I do any 'research' looking up definitions of the term - I just made something up that helped me think about scalable distribution) but Marc's comment did make me realise that to date, the only real Wikipedia contributions I've made have been to fix the odd typo and revert the occasional page to get rid of spam.</p>

<p>So here's the question - if I wanted to try out a radical redefinition of broadcast on Wikipedia that was fit for th 21st century media landscape, how should I go about it? </p>

<p>Make a change to the actual entry page, or go into the discussion/Talk page and float the idea there?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wikipedia" rel="tag">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/broadcast" rel="tag">broadcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

 <br />
<a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a> - Open Learning Broadly Construed</p>

<p>Coals to Newcastle, given OU status in open and distance education.</p>

<p>Routes to sustainability<br />
Leveraging learning that always happens... e.g. immersive language learning</p>

<p>"Cartesian view of learning" - transfer of knowledge, "I teach, you learn" delivery models, naturally fosters subject disciplines..</p>

<p>cf. the social view of learning,  "we participate therefore we are", <em>understanding</em> (rather than knowledge) is socially constructed.</p>

<p>"We learn in and through our interaction with others and the world."</p>

<p>Nothing beats collaborative study groups - best indicator of ??? is the ability to join and participate in a collaborative study group.</p>

<p>This works in the distributed world (e.g. via IM) as well as face-to-face.</p>

<p>"The social life of learning".</p>

<p>Students are already embedded in a social network (from home, school etc.) when they arrive at university, and this forms one special sort of study group...</p>

<p>The best way to learn something is to teach something - study groups again....</p>

<p>Learning as supported through participatory architectures...</p>

<p>Come to understand knowledge through conversations with others.</p>

<p>The architecture studio - the <a href="http://www.architexturez.net/+/subject-listing/000013.shtml">atelier form of learning</a>, a powerful social learning envt<br />
 - learning as enculturation into a practice;<br />
 - work in progress is made public;<br />
-&gt; peripheral participation layer.</p>

<p>Beyond textbook learning, from learning-about, to learning-to-be.</p>

<p>**Can we reverse the flow - turn passionate learning-to-be into learning about.. "Unleashing productive enquiry"</p>

<p>Technology enabled active learning <a href="http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/teal_tour.htm">TEAL</a><br />
Move MIT electo/mag course to a studio based model. "Sage on the stage" doesn't work...</p>

<p>'Modern' kids from the global world, mobile phones and web connectivity.</p>

<p>Tinkering as a  learning platform - it's death and rebirth as remix, mashups.</p>

<p>tinkering stop - devices became cognitively impenetrable; then tinkering returned... open source, game mods, media remix<br />
Tinkering today is gender neutral [??!?!?!always was?? - tinkering in kitchen and home, clothingg etc actively pursued by women..]</p>

<p>Polyani - tacit knowledge - <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm">http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm</a></p>

<p>Life in the digital age - a culture of participation: tinkering, building, remixing, sharing. Creating meaning - I produce and others build on.</p>

<p>Ying and yang of production and consumption</p>

<p>Open source as a participatory learning platform; distributed, situated learning. Process of enculturation - pick up sensibilities and practices of a pre-existing, working community.</p>

<p>Remix and mashup - creative tinkering and the play of imagination; fan fiction [but also think play - playing out TV scenes];</p>

<p>Filling in backstory -creative reading.</p>

Manufacturing economy  - consumer society - creator economy (culture of co-creation and participation)</p>

<p>Active blending - yin-yang odf learning on the one hand and research/doing/making on the other.</p>

<p>From stock (supply push), to flow (demand pull)<br />
From a stable world to a rapidly changing world [but what is it that's changing?]</p>

<p>Learning 2.0 - learning on demand.</p>

<p>When recreation becomes re-creation/remix and productive enquiry: a culture of learning, participatory life long learning and the ultimate sustainability model... [BUT - I prefer daily learning; just as a social app should have a personal payoff, lifelong learning needs appropriate daily practice]<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn2007" rel="tag">openlearn2007</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>"No - use <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google...</a>". Thinking - "Hmm, maybe I should mention <a href="http://show.zoho.com">Zoho</a>...? No, perhaps best not to...."</p>

<p>"?"</p>

<p>"Log in to your Google account and go to <em>docs.google.com</em> - then open a presentation or whatever it's called..."</p>

<p>Later - "how do I get a presentation in to it?"</p>

<p>"Import a document... here, I'll show you...".</p>

<p>The upload hangs, CTRL-ALT-DEL has no effect and the machine needs a hard restart...</p>

<p>"Okay - we'll put <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> on the machine..."</p>

<p>Thinks... "Actually, I'll put <a href="http://sun.com/staroffice">StarOffice</a> on... It's free via <a href="http://pack.google.com">Google Pack</a>, I think..."</p>

<p>[Downloads and installs Star Office; my thinking is that the Google Updater will keep it up to date...]</p>

<p>Every time Star Office starts, there's a wizard to help open a file, start a new presentation etc... but I don't want the wizard... HOW DO I MAKE IT GO AWAY?! Cancelling the wizard closes Star Office... Okay, so I tick "Don't show this wizard again" and go through the wizard to create a dummy presentation...</p>

<p>Opening a pre-existing presentation by clicking on it opens it into the Powerpoint viewer, the default for our home PC. </p>

<p>Panic: "I can't open my files..."</p>

<p>"Of course you can..."</p>

<p>[Right click, open with...]</p>

<p>"How did you do that...?"</p>

<p>"Hang on, I'll change it so it always opens Powerpoint files in Star Office..."</p>

<p>"No, don't, please, don't, it won't work when I use it on another machine..."</p>

<p>Sigh..."Yes it will - I'm setting <em>this</em> machine to open files of <em>that</em> type in a particular application... It has nothing to do with the file itself..."</p>

<p>"Can I be sure the presentation will just work when I try to use it on another machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes  - of course... just save it as a Powerpoint presentation."</p>

<p>Saving it gives a 'some formatting may be lost' error when saving the doc from Star Office as a Powerpoint file...</p>

<p>"Don't worry - it'll be fine; here - look, you can view it with the Powerpoint Viewer..."</p>

<p>Doesn't work - not compatible... "Hmmm..."</p>

<p>I switch on my Mac, fire up Parallels, open the doc in Powerpoint on Mac Parallels XP...</p>

<p>"Okay - it works fine in Powerpoint. So you could do what you have to in Star Office, then I'll load it into Powerpoint and save it as a proper Powerpoint file..."</p>

<p>Thinks... "Maybe I should just buy a copy of Office...";</p>

<p>Looks - a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/suites/default.aspx">free 60 day download trial for Office</a> is available...</p>

<p>"Is 60 days use long enough?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We could use the 60 day trial..."</p>

<p>Thinks...</p>

<p>"Hmm, but after then, we maybe won't be able to use the old version of Word we've currently got, and we'll probably have to buy Office anyway if you want to carrying on using Word..."</p>

<p>Thinks...</p>

<p>Aloud - "shall we just buy a copy of Office? Because you're a student it's only forty quid from this <a href="http://www.theultimatesteal.co.uk/">Ultimate Steal</a> thing. All you need is a dot, A C, U K address."</p>

<p>"I don't..."</p>

<p>"What's your student email address?"</p>

<p>"[xyz123]", or something similar...</p>

<p>"@?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"At??? [xyz123] AT what?"</p>

<p>"Southampton".</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"ac uk."</p>

<p>"Right - a dot A C U K address.."</p>

<p>Thinks... hmm - Office 2007 ultimate, or whatever it is, might struggle on our old Windows XP Home machine..."</p>

<p>Looks - another - old  - works laptop has appeared; Windows 98; boots - system disk error...</p>

<p>"Take the floppy out..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"There's a floppy in there - take it out and start the machine again..."</p>

<p>There is - "How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"When you booted, it tried to boot from the floppy?"</p>

<p>"?" - blank look...</p>

<p>"When you start the computer, it has to boot up... boot up? ... Never mind... Tt's, err, I've seen it happen before; and there was a floppy in the drive then; so there could be now. Take it out and restart it, it'll be fine..."</p>

<p>The old, old Windows 98 laptop starts up - faster than our family XP PC...</p>

<p>Powerpoint - success :-)</p>

<p>Whilst trying, "Can I use my USB stick with this...?"</p>

<p>Nothing - no driver...</p>

<p>"We'd have to find a driver..."</p>

<p>The machine has no wireless, is not networked.</p>

<p>"You could use a floppy..." - the home PC has one... "but the computer you have to give the presentation from probably won't; so you'd have to use the floppy to put it back on the PC, then copy it onto the memory stick... Do you want a new laptop?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Do we need that PC? Do you just want a new laptop? And we'll put Office on it?"</p>

<p>Thinks - I have a new laptop for a robot project... Sighs... "Use this... the account is X and the password is Y" (there's a big label stuck on the machine with those details...</p>

<p>"What? Hang on. I'll write it down..."</p>

<p>"There - it's written there...[arghhh]... "</p>

<p>Starts... starts Powerpoint - something or other version incompatibility...</p>

<p>"There's a 'version incompatibility..."</p>

<p>"What? WHAT?" Click it away... "There, it's fine, what's the problem?.... Now just make sure you only save to and from the memory stick, because I need to keep that account clean..."<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hassle" rel="tag">hassle</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/office" rel="tag">office</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I don't know about you, but my bank uses my birthday as one of the ways to find out that I am really me... which is why I try to be wary about posting my real birthday on public profiles.</p>

<p>However, many people <em>do</em> like to declare their birthday on their MySpace or Facebook profile, so how about this: we take a lead from the Queen and have <em>two</em> birthdays - one on the anniversary of our birth, and <em>another one</em>, that we announce on our public web profiles?</p>

<p>I mentioned the idea to Brian Kelly earlier this week, and he was in all in favour of it, suggesting that our <em>web</em>, <em>internet</em>, or just plan old <em>public birthday</em> might correspond to the date we first logged on... I'm not sure I can remember that far back, though..</p>

<p>I just got a heads up from <a href="http://diigo.com">Diigo</a> about their new <a href="http://slides.diigo.com/">Web Slideshow</a> app - a tool that lets you bookmark a set of URLs and then play them back as a slideshow, like <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006041.html">deliShow</a> used to do, although with a far nicer interface, and the ability to add a soundtrack.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMHCrd9RNCw">demo movie</a>:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iMHCrd9RNCw"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iMHCrd9RNCw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>I particularly like the drag'n'drop ability to reorder the set of links to be used in the show - far slicker than the "1.0" approach used in H2O playlists!</p>

<p>I deliberately avoided the 'freeplay' approach in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010531.html">feedshow</a>, which was intended as a presenter tool; but I wonder, would it be handy to add that as an option?</p>

<!--
<p>One of the reasons I try not to develop proof-of-concept apps that require databases is because many people just don't have access to an online database service. When I build a myself a <s>toy</s> "web page application", I try to write in a text editor using only HTML, CSS and Javascript,  with a dash of free and open third party web services.</p>

<p>Things are changing all the time though, with the arrival of more and more online database applications that provide, among other things, straightforward RESTful (i.e. "URL implemented") interfaces.</p>

<p>One that caught my eye playing catch-up this week was <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/OnlineService.aspx">Codename Astoria</a> from Microsoft. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2007/08/03/create-your-own-hosted-astoria-data-service.aspx">original blog announcement</a> describes it thus:<br />
<blockquote>The Astoria online service is an experimental service that aims at exploring programming models for data on the web, offered in the form of a service. Using the Astoria online service, web developers can create custom structured data stores (up to 100MB in size) on the web and access them from anywhere that they have Internet access. These data services can then be the storage or data source for mashups, or the backing store for Internet enabled applications, or be applied to any other scenario where a rich data service on the web is required, independently of where it is hosted.</blockquote></p>

<p>I've been looking for a quick'n'easy only data service for a daily feed reading app I'd like to try out, so maybe I'll give Astoria a go?</p>

<p>Also in this area in my catch-up feedpile is that <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/tutorial/index.html">Freebase</a> is starting to <a href="http://www.profy.com/2007/08/23/freebase-search/">open up it's search services to the public</a>. In case you haven't come across it yet, Freebase is a "shared, collaboratively produced database of the world's knowledge", the sort of thing that could sit behind a "live semantic encyclopedia".</p>

<p>Being able to search through - and generate views over, or reports from - uploaded (as well as user entered) data is also possible through services such as <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a> (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6wZmYMWKLkY">see a demo</a>).</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6wZmYMWKLkY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6wZmYMWKLkY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Of course, many potential database use cases require user input via HTML web forms, and there are all manner of services that will help you build a web form to get data in to a database that is set up for you by the form building application. One that I try to keep tabs on is <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/">Zoho Creator</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPWpQk54kJk">see a demo</a>). </p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PPWpQk54kJk"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PPWpQk54kJk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Zoho Creator provides you with an (online) environment for developing forms to collect information as well as application logic for processing the collected data, realising in part what I had in mind in a post from a year or so ago: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006123.html">WebApping - Web Apps Made Blog Easy</a>!</p>

<p>PS because it feels as if my posts always mention a Google app, I've deliberately refrained from mentioning <a href="http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a> in this post, the database engine built into  the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html">Google Gears</a> browser extension, or the Google Base support offered from the <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Mashup Editor</a>... Doh!</p>

<p>A week away from a daily play, and my feedreader now contains way too many unread messages. Prompted by this CNET News post on <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9747138-7.html">The battle of the mashup editors</a>,  I also realise that I probably haven't been keeping up with updates to the Google Mashup Editor or Microsoft Popfly since I played with them the day the invites originally came out... (aaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhh - not enough time to play with the big toys, let alone keep up with the little ones...........!)</p>

<p>So - top of the to do list is to catch up with feature releases from <a href="http://blog.pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a>, <a href="http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/blog/">Microsoft Popfly</a> and <a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/">Google Mashup Editor</a> (as well as the other various Google APIs, like the <a href="http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/">AJAX feed API</a>).</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I haven't even played with IBM's <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/qedwiki/">QEDWIki</a> <em>at all</em>, yet... or the <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=716">Intel Mashmaker</a> tool (though I guess access to that isn't available at the mo...).</p>

<p>As everyone seems to be releasing <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/autodiscovery">feed autodiscovery</a>  - at least, Yahoo Pipes and Google AJAX API both offer this now (as does this <a href="http://simplepie.org/">PHP library</a>) - I feel I really should try to build something that makes use of this... the only question  is, what? Something <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">String'n'Glue</a> related, maybe?</p>

<p>I'm also hoping that when the OpenLearn folks finally start moving the OpenLearn feeds from the dev server onto the public one, they'll make the feeds autodiscoverable... Although just what possibilities that will open up for feed related creativity, I'm not sure yet!</p>

<p><hr /><br />
PS I notice that I get live suggestions from my Firefox search widget (at least with Google as the search engine).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5090147511648723714"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RqPWMW4pIwI/AAAAAAAAAJo/5CV_cZVEROM/s800/googleSuggest.png" /></a></p>

<p>It'd be really neat - particularly for navigational/known item queries, where you <em>know</em> the result you want to find - if below the bar in the drop down live suggestions it also gave the top three hits for the current query-in-progress, live search style, treating them as clickable links rather than search terms...</p>

<p>From the rather wonderful <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2007/06/hollywood-gam-4.html">Wonderland</a> blog, a report on the rather intriguing <a href="http://www.afterworld.tv/">Afterworld</a>, apparently as told by it's creator-writer Brent Friedman...</p>

<p>...but first, here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy9v7etZG74">Afterworld - Episode 1</a>...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zy9v7etZG74"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zy9v7etZG74" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<blockquote>So I took an old idea that I always wanted to do as a TV series, but was always told it would be way too expensive. I wanted it to be an internet series, told for today's attention-deficit audiences, in 2-3 min bites, but I didn't want to sacrifice the scope or drama.
...
So we came up with this notion of an animated drama, told in bites, and our first season was going to be 130 episodes.
...
We realized that we'd created modular entertainment: it was designed to be a daily delivery, mon-fri, for 6 months. What we thought is... we can distribute on mobile overseas: Europe and Asia and South America have a much more developed mobile system than we do. We can distribute over the internet, in conjunction with network play: take 5 episodes and smush them together, and you have a 15m episode, which can be used as interstitials.

<p>Take 2 weeks of episodes, and smush, you get a half hour show. Sony's approach was, we love multiplatform capabilities, but we really love that we can sell this as half-hour television, and offer all sorts of other opportunities to each territory on a multiplatform basis. So we wrote the stories in 2-week episode arcs. Everything works just as a 3-min and as part of a bigger whole. <br />
...<br />
We put this together, there was a study done in Europe by a consortium of advertisers and media buyers, and they were looking to find the optimum timelength in mobile ents for retaining attention for ad placement.<br />
...<br />
So folks are looking to the digital medium and asking, how much will people remember? 2m 47s is the magic number: after that length, something shown in the intro, the preroll, would be retained 100% by the key demographic. 100%! So our episodes are 2m and 57s.</blockquote></p>

<p>The three minute single folks seem to have got it right, then...! I wonder if there's also something here in terms of effective presentation technique - like making a major point every three minutes or so? Or reinforcing a point every three minutes?</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - this idea of producing content chunks that work as independent, standalone items and yet can be rolled together into longer, coherent packages is one that feels right to me (as touched on in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010463.html">(Not?) Talking about Multimedia</a>).</p>

<p>Ideally, though, the chunks might use different media (a paragraph of text, a short video, an audio clip) or have a different "force" - explanatory text, one side of an argument, the framing of a question or exercise - and (the hard one, this) be capable of being delivered in different bundles - the movies or audio clips being rolled together, for example (as with the Afterworld episodes).</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure how to achieve this - yet - but I hope to try various ways out over the next few months. For internal readers, some doodlings will be available <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/t151dev/">here</a>. Things will be pretty standard fare on that site for the first month or two as I try to identify blendable component parts, but any and all feedback/suggestions/experiments will be much appreciated on how we might develop this line of thinking, or if, indeed, it is worth pursuing at all... </p>

<p>My first day listening to <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> for a bit (no particular reason for being away from it, just one of those things), and the last few songs that have played have all been new/recent releases...</p>

<p>Hmmm... like maybe they're playing new stuff they want me to go and buy...?</p>

<p>The big search engines, and their commentators, often post a <em>weather report</em> when the ranking algorithms change, to let people know their position in the search engine organic listings may change.</p>

<p>As more and more sites get into social recommendation systems, mediated with a bit of secret sauce, voodoo algorithm magic, the ones that succeed will be the ones that perform for their users. That is, the ones with trusted algorithms.</p>

<p>When the algorithms change, so can the feeling of the site.</p>

<p>So I wonder, have things changed at last.fm, or is it just one of those playlist things...?</p>

<h3 class="title">(Not Really About) Institutional Blogging - Codes of Conduct</h3>

<!--
<p>In a week or two, I'm second fiddle to Martin Weller in a workshop on edu-blogging in the OU (see the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful Calendar</a> for details). One of the things I guess will be covering is what is and what isn't appropriate content.</p>

<p>So here's something that's perhaps a little close to the bounds of good sense...</p>

<p>The OU prides itself on being a distance education institution. We will shortly be requiring all our students to have internet access. We know that many of our students are in full time employment. Server stats presumably tell - err - someone, when our students are logging in (as academics running online courses we aren't currently privy to server stats... make of that what you will...)</p>

<p>We have internationally registered students - who pay more, I think, because we don't receive HEFCE funding for them. Presumably, some of our international students are in different time zones to the UK.</p>

<p>We are open to students of all backgrounds - presumably including some who don't observe "Christian" holidays.</p>

<p>I would guess - though I don't know - that many of our students study early in the morning, during evenings, and at weekends (even a short, 10 point course has an expectation of a nominal 10 hours study per week). Maybe we have survey data on this? That is, data on daily and weekly study patterns over 24 hour and 7 day cycles?</p>

<p>The OU's original mission was to be "'Open as to people, open as to places, open as to methods and open as to ideas"; more recently has come the recognition that <em>time</em> is often a barrier to entry, and one that is often discussed in terms of presentation patterns and course workloads.</p>

<p>So what sort of helpdesk support, particularly computer helpdesk support, should we be offering as we move towards <em>requiring</em> our students to have internet access? 24/7 most of the time? 24/7 in the Tesco sense (i.e. 16/1, 24/4, 22/1, 6/1)? Or something rather less? Like <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/">this</a> maybe?</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5069402461718860514"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rloirho-UuI/AAAAAAAAACY/rG5bkGeSAMM/s800/OUhelpdesk.png" /></a></p>

<p>That is, 13.5/7, except Bank Holidays and Wednesdays...</p>

<p>If a significant proportion of our students are studying "out-of-hours", are they being fairly supported? Especially when you take into account that it's during the early hours computer systems do seem to go down, albeit often only temporarily...</p>

<p>(Hmm, now what prompted this post, do you think? ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Announcement Round Up</h3>

A quick post to round up a couple of announcements while I listen to the Pop Said (the best of the Darling Buds), which is as much fun to listen to now as it was almost 20 years ago (gulp)....
<!--
<p>A quick post to round up a couple of announcements while I listen to the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pop-Said-Darling-Buds/dp/B000GJ28B4/?tag=ouseful-21">Pop Said (the best of the Darling Buds)</a>, which is as much fun to listen to now as it was almost 20 years ago (gulp). </p>

<p>(If you haven't come across the Darling Buds here's a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0qHZROQWGRo">Darling Buds video clip on youTube</a>:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0qHZROQWGRo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0qHZROQWGRo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Okay - so here's the announcements: heads up again for the final call for papers for the OpenLearn Conference:<br />
<blockquote>The call for papers is open for the openlearn 2007 conference: researching open content in education. Deadline for submission by short papers (~1000words) is 31st May 2007. The conference will be held 30-31 October 2007 near The Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. There will be no charge for attendance with priority for registration given to those responding to the call for papers. Selected papers will be developed for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Interactive Media in Education.<br />
 <br />
The four main themes are: <br />
- agenda<br />
- Sustainability<br />
- User experience<br />
- Software and tools<br />
 <br />
Further information can be found at: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/">http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007</a>.</p>

<p>Forms for submission of papers can be found at <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/papers.php">http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/papers.php</a> and should be emailed to  <a href="mailto:openlearn-conference@open.ac.uk">openlearn-conference@open.ac.uk</a> by 31st May 2007.</blockquote></p>

<p>Second up - I'm doing a talk in the Library ICT Suite on Wednesday (almost as described on the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful calendar</a>) on <em>Social Bookmarking</em> - sort of... as well as a quick overview of social bookmarking (in the vein of delicious et al., for anyone who is new to the idea of social bookmarking), I'll also be covering different ways of piping links into display spaces (web pages, Moodle environments, personal portals etc.) and looking at how to bookmark searches and multimedia items, among other things (which may be of interest if you have been to one of my previous SB workshops). The workshop will be run using a partial attention format, and networked computers will be available - though you can still bring a wireless laptop if you prefer.</p>

<p>I'm also getting to go on a couple of jollies, to the <a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/en_GB/details.html">Google API/Developers Day</a> in London on May 31st, and also the Yahoo/BBC Backstage hack day:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/en_GB/details.html"><img style="border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;" src="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/images/dev_green_small2.gif" /></a> <!-- Hack Day button 180px wide by 105px tall --><a href="http://www.hackday.org" style="border: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/ydn/hackday/hack_day_pattern_four.gif" alt="Hack Day: London, June 16/17 2007" width="180" height="105" style="border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><!-- Hack Day button ends --></p>

<p>Feel free to get in touch if you fancy meeting up at either of those (or for a pint after...)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the Darling Buds... I never did see them play live (I don't think... or the <a href-="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PRCGb6bBbY4">Voice of the Beehive</a>, come to that) though I did once manage to catch both <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_N8bGHtUGJU">Transvision Vamp</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AQFo2-xZiks">The Primitives</a> on the same bill at Warwick University; and took a hit promoting <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7MTq4I0hvq8">Daisy Chainsaw</a> a few years later...</p>

<p>Here's all of them in a <a href="">Splashcastmedia player</a>:</p>

<p>...along with a <em>dodgy goth</em> show, too...</p>

<p>I haven't been in for a bit (can't stand the 10 minute download each time, hate the latency on the interface, etc etc) but I think I get an inkling of how we're going to use the space... ;-)</p>

<p>...pushing text as images...</p>

<p>At least it gives you something to do in world (i.e. read)...</p>

<p>Hmmm... what really gets me about Second Life is that there are several people here in the OU being given time and resource to look at it...</p>

<p>...whereas there are dozens of <em>other</em> "web 2.0" tools, apps and approaches that could potentially offer real benefit to students now that <em>aren't</em> being looked at, that <em>aren't</em> being explored/played with, that <em>aren't</em> having resource allocated to their development.</p>

<p>Four or five years ago, whenever you'd hear someone giving out a URL, they'd start out by saying: "H T T P colon slash slash W W W dot..." and so on...</p>

<p>Two or three years ago, the 'http://' requirement largely became deprecated. Instead, you knew it a URL was being given out because it would start 'W W W'.</p>

<p>One or two years ago, most websites made the 'www.' optional. For example, I typically use the form <em>example.com</em> when I want to enter the URL of a site...</p>

<p>...and more often than not it works okay...</p>

<p>... but not,  (currently: 19/4/07), with <a href="http://open.ac.uk">open.ac.uk</a> ...</p>

<p>Ho hum....</p>

<p>PS I don't think people even bother giving URLs now, do they? "Just google <em>open university</em> and you should find it..."</p>

<p>In a neat post on the question of whether <a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2007/04/will_virtual_representations_o.php">virtual representations of sporting events [will] become part of the online rights economy</a>, Martin Belam describes the use of <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/3d/">Cricinfo 3D</a> to provide over-by-over cricket match coverage:<br />
<blockquote>Rather than just describing the action in near real-time, they show you, using a game engine to simulate the match being played... As each ball in the over is bowled, a Shockwave plug-in on the web-page illustrates the action.<br />
You can select the camera angle you want to view the action from, either choosing TV style coverage, a fixed position like from the stumps, or a view through the bowler or the batsman's eyes, or from the point of view of the wicket keeper.</blockquote><br />
I've sort posted on this topic <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005939.html">before</a>, and see Cricinfo 3D as being another indicator along the path to "I'll take it from here" video gaming.</p>

<p>By that, I mean sports simulations in which the state of the game at which the player starts is a duplicate of the state of the game in the real world.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>- in a cricket sim, rather than watch a replay of a particular delivery, you could take the bat and see if you could do better. The fielding positions and the actual flight of the ball (captured using something like <a href="http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/">Hawk Eye</a>) would be faithful - at least at the start of the shot!</p>

<p>- in a snooker sim, you could pick up a (real) 147 break making frame after the reds have been cleared.</p>

<p>- in an F1 race, you could take over the drive from a real driver. The AI controlling the other drivers could directly simulate an actual race for at least as long as the time as your actions have no influence on any other particular car.</p>

<p>- in a round of golf, you could matchplay an actual game against someone else - or pick up the hole at any point in a championship winning round.</p>

<p>So what? you may say... Sounds a bit dull... just replaying some old game...</p>

<p>Ah yes - but what about if you 'take it from here' during the actual event and play along, maybe split screen style?</p>

<p>Or maybe during the TV replay, your digital ents box offers you a re:play? That is, you get to try the shot, etc. (maybe even 'for real', wii style ;-)</p>

<p>It'd be one way of filling time while the adverts are on!</p>

<p>What this boils down to is interactive sports viewing; or in other words: "I could have made that one - here, I'll show you...".</p>

<p>I don't know know if the "realtime re:play or "I'll take it from here" gaming already exists - maybe it does? (if so, can you drop me a line?)</p>

<p>But it's one of the things I'll be looking out for as we start to write our new short course on game design and interactive media...</p>

<h3 class="title">The Future of Music</h3>

<!--
<p>Old news now in the blogosphere - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6516189.stm">EMI lets go of DRM on iTunes</a> (a good summary - and links to the press releases - <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/emi_music_drm_free.php">here</a>) - but a useful hook for this post - who's interested in MP3 downloads when you can recompile the source?</p>

<p><a href="http://remix.nin.com/">NIN</a> (that's Nine Inch Nails) look set to release <em>all</em> the tracks on their forthcoming album as <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> 'source' files; </p>

<p><img alt="ninRemix.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ninRemix.png" width="618" height="237" border="0" /></p>

<p>NIN have actually been doing this with <a href="http://www.nin.com/downloads/index.html">one-off tracks</a> for a couple of years, and encouraging remixers to upload their mixes as part of a remix competition. In addition to Garageband files, releases have also been made for other audio mixing software.</p>

<p>A slightly different approach is taken by <a href="http://www.u-myx.com/">U-Myx</a> who require users to use the U-Myx software - and pay for the downloads.</p>

<p>But for a similar result - the user gets to play... ;-)</p>

<p>This approach is something I have dreamed of over the last 15 years as wouldn't-it-be-good-if idles, and anticipated eagerly more recently. My expectation over the last 5 years or so was that CD singles/albums would start to include remix applications/software studios on that medium - but I've been tracking it as a download reality on and off for the last 6 months or so (though it's been happening for longer).</p>

<p>That said - my expectation of getting the 'src' on the CD was predicated on the supply of the remix application on the CD too, rather than it being pre-installed on the users' computer.</p>

<p>The next thing I'm looking out for is a 'live by machine' gig, where a club franchise has real hardware/synths being played <em>at a distance</em> by the band, who are maybe in another venue owned by that club chain?</p>

<p>For this, you have to imagine banks of synths receiving (MIDI) control signals over the net from the <em>real</em> musicians playing live elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is not so much <a href="http://www.ninjam.com/index.php">online jamming</a> (or here: <a href="http://www.ejamming.com/">eJamming</a>) - where you mix realtime audio feeds from other musicians on the web with your own efforts - as real time creation of the music from audio generators...</p>

<p>.. a bit like the way audio in games works today, and how <a href="http://www.game-revolution.com/news/view.php?id=2419">MIDI created audio in computer games</a> is going.</p>

<p>And the next step after that?</p>

<p>Well, you won't be downloading MP3. Instead I'm looking forward to a time when we'll be downloading a Garageband-like mix to our Garageband-like stereos - its audio card will generate sounds using onboard synths and samplers and do a real time audio mix for you.</p>

<p>So if you like to tinker with a graphic equaliser on your current stereo, the Garageband-like remix player is gonna be a whole load of fun... ;-)</p>

<p>PS have you ever wanted to <em>play</em> in a band - then <a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-10/mf_harmonix">Rock Band - The Game</a> may be just the thing... participatory culture, here we come... ;-) </p>

<!--
<p>With the recent <a href="http://secondlife.com/developers/opensource/">open sourcing of the Second Life client</a>, it'll be interesting to see what innovations spring from it. One idea I'm quite taken by, and which would provide a good first step on 'coding with the SL client" course or tutorial, is a simple SL viewer widget which would, if the 'owner' was in world, display what the owner was seeing at the time. It's also the sort of widget I could imagine spreading like crazy on sites like MySpace.</p>

<p>The "Through My Eyes" widget (aka "Being Me", after the similarly themed "Being John Malkovich") could also make for an interesting demonstration of presence, methinks?</p>

<p>All sorts of opportunities for frankly pointless fun arise. Users who were happy for others to see the world through their eyes could register their details to a "Through Random Eyes" service, which could provide almost minutes of idle entertainment.</p>

<p>More generally, I wonder to what extent there already are 'attentional presence' widgets out there. For example, widgets that lists the books I am currently reading (may based on a live feed of my library book loans) or the films I am watching (if online DVD rental firms expose that information as a feed, for example), or even books I have just bought. The <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> service exposes the tracks you have just listed to through its API (a feature used to good effect by <a href="http://slevenotez.com">Sleeventoez</a>) so it would be easy enough to feed this information through to a widget.</p>

<p>Related to this, I was toying with the idea of a simple browser plugin that would use the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009187.html">statex</a> webservice to display the URL of the last page I loaded into my browser (the code would be trivial - simply update a particular statex global web variable to the URL of the current page*) but I'm not ready yet for revealing that much about myself!</p>

<p>* something like this works as a bookmarklet, for example:<br />
 javascript: window.location="http://statex.ning.com/updateState.php?id=25&pwd=test&item="+window.location</p>

<p>And finally, on a similar related topic, I was chatting with Ian Martin today about a webtop like departmental display board that could be fed by people's "work related attentional state". This might, for example, list details of the courses or projects people were currently and actively working on, or bids they were preparing, for example. </p>

<p>Instant messaging systems like Google chat (and probably many others - but I have little or no experience of them) let you customise the message that is displayed alongside your presence indicator, so the attentional status board would just elaborate on this.</p>

<p>It may even be interesting to integrate this in some way with a to-do list, e.g. to display the things I am currently doing, or perhaps those that I have 'just done' whenever I tick them off on the list...</p>

<p>Integration with a <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/22582">time tracker</a> widget would also be interesting...</p>

<p>...although the idea that this is essentially the voluntary adoption of personal timesheets (and more than that - actually clocking in and out of tasks) is quite scarey... ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Okay, so some of you may have noticed that images are behaving - err - oddly - on this site in the last couple of days. I've just started saving my screenshots to an iPhoto gallery on my Mac and then syncing them to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/">Google Picasa web galleries</a> via a <a href="http://picasa.google.com/web/mac_tools.html">Picasa Mac plugin</a>,  and then pulling the images into the blog from my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/ouseful">public Picasa gallery</a>...</p>

<p>...only sometimes, they aren't being pulled in...</p>

<p>I have no idea why this is happening, but will try to explore*. In the meantime, maybe the Picasa experiment wasn't such a good idea.</p>

<p>Anyone know of a 'like flickr, but for screenshots' service? This would be a <em>Good Thing</em> for techie bloggers, I think, with lots of scope for reuse and an opportunity for company marketers to place good quality screenshots showing the best features for bloggers to reuse...</p>

<p>...without the danger of being goatse'd, of course...</p>

<p>Maybe one for Ning to host in the short term as a variant of <a href="http://photos.ning.com/">Ning photos</a>? Ah - it's already there: <a href="http://screenshots.ning.com/">http://screenshots.ning.com</a> - maybe I'll start to use this instead?</p>

<p>(What is it with these photo gallery sites that they don't give you an obvious link to the image - even if they do watermark in exchange for this convenience?)</p>

<p>I wonder, has anyone picked up on the no-brainer follow-on of a screencast video site on Ning too? Aha -  <a href="http://screencasts.ning.com/">http://screencasts.ning.com/</a> ;-) (Not much used though, if the <em>Most recent...</em> listing is anything to go by...</p>

<p>* just been playing a bit more, and for some reason my browser keeps failing to make a connection to the Google Web Picasa server my photos are on... it's the first sign Google monster - your days are numbered...  if you can't cope with the load, get out of the server farm. Maybe Amazon EC2 can help you out? ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Okay - so here's my pick up on <a href="http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2007/01/11/blog-tagged-again/">blog tag from John Tropea</a>...<br />
<ol><li>I'm an information junky, and subscribe to far more feeds than I could sensibly keep up with if I did my day job properly ;-)</li><br />
<li>I once ran a company ("Drayhouse Promotions Ltd") promoting bands - when we formed the company we said to ourselves we knew we'd have made it if we ever promoted <a href="http://www.hawkwind.com/">Hawkwind</a>. As promoters, we were offered two big bands early on in our 'career' - Hawkwind and Nirvana. Of course, we booked Hawkwind and lost a bundle. Nirvana immediately released <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind">Nevermind</a> and went huge...</li><br />
<li>I'm a fan of the Luddite cause (Luddism was big in <a href="http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/luddites.html">Marsden</a>, near Huddersfield, where I was brought up). The Luddites were the skilled workers of their time, rebelling against technologies that deskilled their craft.</li><br />
<li>Close friends since 1987 all call me Monty (it's not a very long story: anagram('tony')+'m').</li><br />
<li>My top five, err, cultural things, are maybe <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Labyrinths-Selected-Stories-Writings-Classics/dp/0141184841">Labyrinths</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Tanguy">the art of Yves Tanguy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Appetite-Destruction-Guns-n-Roses/dp/B000026E3O">Appetite for Destruction</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls">An Inspector Calls</a>, <a href="http://www.brautigan.net/">Brautigan</a>.</li></ol></p>

<p>And as such is this game of tag, Brautigan leads into the first person I'll tag - who introduced me to Brautigan: <a href="http://www.offmessage.com/">Andy Theyers</a>, thence <a href="http://memex.naughtons.org/">John Naughton</a>, <a href="http://www.knownet.com/writing/weblogs/Graham_Attwell/">Graham Attwell</a>,  <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc Eisensdtadt</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/">Brian Lamb</a> (who hasn't been posting much of late?).</p>

<p>Couldn't resist - from the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4od/">Channel 4 <em>4oD</em></a> site, which will allow users to download, on demand, a wide variety of <a href="http://www.channel4.com">Channel 4</a> content:</p>

<blockquote>Will you offer 4oD for the Macintosh?

<p>Category: 4oD | Sub Category: Getting Started<br />
Unfortunately not at the launch of 4oD.</p>

<p>This is an industry-wide issue caused because the accepted Digital Rights Management (DRM) system used to protect online video content, which is required by our content owners, is not compatible with Apple Mac hardware and software. The closed DRM system used by Apple is not currently available for licence by third parties and there is no other Mac-compatible DRM solution which meets the protection requirements of content owners. Unfortunately, we are therefore unable to offer 4oD content to Mac users at this stage.</blockquote></p>

<p>Good old Apple... content rights are sorted (in this case, at least... and yes, I know that's a simplistic view...)  - now the problem's with the technology platform. I guess what Apple really want is stuff to go through iTunes, for a fee*, so that they can topslice. </p>

<p>Know what - I was gonna treat myself to Mac Mini for use as a home entertainment hub. Maybe a PC would be better...?</p>

<p>PS and what is it with the BBC and RealPlayer..........?</p>

<p>* To clarify that point, the 4oD service is primarily pay-to-play (any number of times during the 48 hr rental period, although I think some content has an outright purchase option...)</p>

<!--
<p>In the bits of the blogosphere I follow, DRM (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management">digital rights management</a>) is often considered to be a <em>Bad Thing</em> because of the restrictions it places on how the purchaser can use whatever it is that has had DRM applied to it.</p>

<p>How much more uproar would there be if it were conceivable that DRMd songs, for example, could 'infect' or taint DRM free files with copy protection? Just imagine it - viral DRM!</p>

<p>At a time when some of the world's largest media companies are beginning to see value in allowing their catalogue items to be shared, it is   maybe worth casting an eye over at the biotech firms, and in particular the seed 'manufacturers', who are developing gene technologies that  cause second generation plants to be sterile, thus preventing purchasers of first generation seed from saving seed from the plants they have grown. If I was minded to coin a phrase to describe this approach, <em>Biological Rights Management</em> (BRM) or <em>Genetic Rights Management</em> (GRM) are two that come to mind.</p>

<p>And note that I don't mean BRM in the sense of patents on genes, which is difficult enough to think clearly about. This is about genetically engineering biological reproductive processes so that copy protection is built in.</p>

<p>Known widely as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_technology"><em>Terminator Technology</em></a>, there is spectrum of concerns amongst many opponents of this form of genetic engineering, ranging from the purely economic (farmers can't buy seed one year, then save it for the next - they have to buy it in each year) to fears that TT plants may contaminate, through pollination, non-BRMd plants.</p>

<p>Many plants are propagated seedlessly, of course, traditionally through the use of cuttings, and <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2002-04/1020215334.Ag.r.html">how seedless fruits propagate</a> is another story altogether, but for us to try to engineer in what amounts to copy protection, using approaches that I assume are rather more lab-based than traditional cross or selective plant breeding ever was, concerns me somewhat.</p>

<p>What brought this to my attention was an article in the latest <a href="http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/organic_way/index.php">Organic Way</a> magazine, which I still receive having signed up to and never left what was the Henry Doubleday Research Association (HDRA) - now rebranded as 'Garden Organic' - ten or more years ago, when life was more balanced and I still had an allotment!</p>

<p>My interest piqued, I had a little dig around for recent news stories about the state of the art in this sort of technology, and found a <a href="http://banterminator.org/news_updates/news_updates/monsanto_announces_takeover_of_delta_pine_land">news item</a> from the activist group <a href="http://banterminator.org">banterminator.org</a> about Monsanto recently buying a company that pioneered the development of Terminator gene technology.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=6820">Dvorak Uncensored</a> also picked up on that announcement and had a little rant about it.</p>

<p>Time maybe to start watching this one before the biological rootkits get out of hand? And I don't just mean in the sense of <a href="http://www.cabi-bioscience.org/html/japanese_knotweed_alliance.htm">Japanese knotweed</a>!</p>

<h3 class="title">Using Educational Institutional Blogs to Raise "Brand Awareness"</h3>

Whilst this blog is very definitely not part of the official OU communications machinery, it does have the potential act as a communications channel for OU news and information that might also be of interest to external readers. One thing...
<!--
<p>Whilst this blog is very definitely <em>not</em> part of the official OU communications machinery, it does have the potential act as a communications channel for OU news and information that might also be of interest to external readers.</p>

<p>One thing I've started to aks myself is how the OU can start to make use of these channels for raising brand awareness, and perhaps even targeted advertising (just to raise the question, nothing sinister ;-)</p>

<p>For example, the OU has a close relationship with the BBC and co-produces many high profile broadcast offerings - <a href="http://www.open2.net/roughscience/">Rough Science</a>, for example, and <a href="http://www.open2.net/coast/index.html">Coast</a> to name but two. (For a more complete listing, visit the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> website.)</p>

<p>Should I be dropping mention of forthcoming progammes, with links to the relevant website, for example (like when the <a href="http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=30611&jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&sessionID=-1150150325699&entityName=object">Money programme did Search/Google</a>?)</p>

<p>And then there are the employment opportunites. As with any large organisation, there is a always steady trickle of current appointments/job ads, some of which are likely to be of interest to readers. For example, at the moment there are these posts open:<br />
<hr /><br />

(If you apply, please mention where you first saw the ad on the OUseful blog!;-)</p>

<p>As far as I know, the job ads pages were some of the first OU pages to offer RSS feeds (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/rss-jobs.asp">OU current vacancies feed</a>). Was this driven by external drivers I wonder? Is the jobs market/recruitment industry hot on feeds? (Hmm  - I need to check out that feed again to see if they are using any semantic markup to really make the most of the feed medium. Is there any standard RDF for marking up job ads, I wonder?)</p>

<p>We're also large enough to have a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/">media relations/press office</a> that puts out one or two news releases a week (they even have an <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/ounewsrss.aspx">OU news wire</a> (i.e. RSS feed)).</p>

<p>And then there are our courses - not just for undergrads (like the entry level <a href="htt://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t183">Design for the Web Course</a>, or the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">Web ApplicationsCertificate</a>) or postgrads (like the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C02">Computing for Commerce and Industry (CCI)</a> Diploma/Masters programme), but also increasingly in the area of short <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/for-business/">CPD</a> courses. </p>

<p>One of the things I've started to think about is how I'd feel (and how the readership would feel) if banner ads for courses, BBC/OU programmes etc. were (very occasionally) inserted at the bottom of a post by the system (you'll notice perhaps I blog from a site rooted on <em>http://blogs.open.ac.uk</em>).</p>

<p>And finally, there is informal 'consultancy'. One of the extra-curricular things I do as  well as this blog is to help run the <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk">OU Robotics Outreach Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.robofesta-uk.org">RoboFesta-UK</a> website (this latter site generates around 15, 000 page impressions a month, and carries a couple of rotating OU short course banner ads).</p>

<p>The group has been around for about 5 years now and is increasingly approached for information and advice about organising robotics related outreach events. One thing I've started to think about is whether we should be askig people to link back to our site from their pages via a small 'OU-ROG Consulting' (!) or 'In association with RoboFesta-UK' graphic when we do provide them with advice.</p>

<p>Why I should <em>want</em> to do this OU promotion stiff via the blog is perhaps not obvious <em>unless</em> you have had some sort of involement with the OU. For all its faults, most people who work there are passionate about the OU Mission (even in the face of creeping corporatisation). The OU does good stuff and we're proud of it:-)</p>

<p>I do wonder how I (and you, dear reader...) would feel if OU related banners appeared at the end of every 10th post, say, with something relevant to the blog buit very obviously OU advertising related. Would it compromise the nature of the blog? Or would it in a sense add value by providing targeted OU related news to a well defined niche audience? (answers <s>on the back of a postcard</s> via the comments...)</p>

<p>Anyway - "normal" ad-free service will resume next post...;-)</p>

<p>The following has just appeared on the <a href="https://intranet.open.ac.uk/oulife/news/index.asp#8949">OU intranet News site</a>, which looks like being a really interesting event (I've seen a speaker list, but don't think it's public yet... interesting line up though (more when I can...)):</p>

<blockquote>Monday 5 June 2006, Berrill Lecture Theatre, Walton Hall, 10.30-13.00.

<p>The Forum will hear short presentations by thought leaders from Amazon, Nokia and the BBC, amongst others, to help us consider "Towards a Global Online University: Future Scenarios for Delivering Higher Education". An open discussion session will follow.</p>

<p>Your insights and questions are sought on topics including the design of next generation ICT, novel business models for HE in an internetworked world, and trends and advances in pedagogy, both online and offline.</p>

<p>Video-conferencing facilities will be available in the regions and the event will be webcast via <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill">Stadium</a>.</blockquote></p>

<p>If you have OU SAMS access, you can submit questions or comments in advance via a link on the Stadium webpage.</p>

<p>Just in passing, I've been Googling <em>towards global online university site:open.ac.uk</em> for a bit in the hope of posting about this event as soon as it was out there (but hey, it's Friday, and the intranet news site is almost public...), and was amused to get more than a few references to this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/johndanielspeeches/HKCAA.htm">TOWARDS THE GLOBAL E-UNIVERSITY: QUALITY OR MEDIOCRITY?</a></p>

<p>a talk from December, 2000, by our <em>previous</em> VC, which I think developed some of the ideas introduced briefly in this artcle from March of that year: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/johndanielspeeches/Open_Eye_March_2000.htm">Towards a Global e-OU</a>.</p>

<p>The UK e-University has of course recently been finally laid to rest. And as it's Friday, I just can't resist <em>not</em> posting this any more:</p>

<p><img alt="eUnivError.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/eUnivError.jpg" width="616" height="214" border="0" /></p>

<p>(We all know what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_error">404</a> is, right? When I checked out that Wikipedia link, I couldn't help but chuckle again at the thought that this error code is sometimes returned when a server is <em>configured not to fulfill the request and not reveal the reason why.</em>...! And for some reason, politics came to mind;-)</p>

<p>Half-listening to <a href="http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/05/01/episode-6-sphere-launch/">a recent episode of TalkCrunch</a> on my commute to work today, there was a brief discussion about 35-40 mins in to the podcast that the web 2.0 way was <em>not</em> to release beta software in the sense of  'feature complete, but potentially buggy' code, but instead to release early and often, function incomplete but useable applications, and then work towards feature completion during the beta phase.</p>

<p>So is this really beta testing? Or should we coin a new variant designation? Next in the alphabet is gamma, I think, then delta.</p>

<p>Delta's interesting - in many sciences it refers to a small change in quantity (so perhaps this is a release phase with regular 0.0.1 version increments?).</p>

<p>But this breaks the alphabetic progression. So how's about redesignating the web 2.0 style beta as a gamma release, where the users might expect stability in operation, but potentially regular and even significant feature upgrades?</p>

<p>Then when the app comes out of gamma, it can go into a period of delta progression, tiny tweaks and fixes until the next round of private alpha, limited beta and then public gamma releases that will culminate in the next version up, 'stable delta' release?</p>

<p>(I'm not computer software engineer, so perhaops gamma and delta releases are already recognised?)</p>
