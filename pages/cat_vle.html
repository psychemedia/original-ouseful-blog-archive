<h3 class="title">Facebook Platform or VLE - where would YOUR students prefer to be?</h3>

I'm not a heavy Facebook user (though I do have more Facebook (and LinkedIn) friends than MySpace friends) but maybe, maybe the Facebook Platform is going to provide stickiness (for me) through the applications I can now use within it?...
<!--
<p>I'm not a heavy Facebook user (though I do have more Facebook (and LinkedIn) friends than MySpace friends) but maybe, maybe the <em>Facebook Platform</em> is going to provide stickiness (for me) through the applications I can now use within it?</p>

<p>Finding apps is not as easy as it might be, but here are a couple that have caught my in a "Facebook as semi-formal <em>ad hoc</em> social learning environment".</p>

<p>Why <em>semi-formal</em>? Because the original Facebook model - connecting people who are students at the same institution - can presumably be leveraged to allow sharing <em>within</em> a particular institution. For example:<br />
<blockquote>The Scribd Facebook app is a way to share documents with your friends and your school. Just like Facebook profiles, documents are only visible at the school of the uploader, so you'll need to add the app to see the docs at your school.</blockquote><br />
...which is what makes it <em>social</em> too.</p>

<p>(And the <em>ad hoc</em>'ery? That comes from users being able to choose which apps they add to their profile... for some of my thoughts from way back when on "<em>ad hoc</em> learning environments", see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html">Integrating Ad Hoc and Formal Communities</a>)</p>

<p>In case you haven't come across it, Scribd is an online document sharing app. One of the things I like about it is the embedded document previewing it offers. In terms of how well it might work as an eportfolio (like the OU's <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/mystuff/">My Stuff</a>), Scribd offers storage, tagging and previewing features.</p>

<p>At the moment, I think Scribd uploads can only be public - which is <em>not</em> so good for a personal portfolio. However, the <a href="http://box.net">Box.net</a> online storage application has already got onto the Facebook platform, so that's a place to keep things privately I guess?</p>

<p>On its own site (?!) Box.net offers <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/boxnet-integrates-zoho/">Zoho integration</a> (discussed in passing here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009692.html">ePortfolios, Distributed Storage and Personal Repository Caches</a>), so it'll be interesting to see whether editing box documents exposed in your Facebook profile via Zoho will be possible... </p>

<p>I briefly commented in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010334.html">PLE as a Platform?</a> how integrating the <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho application suite</a> with Facebook would be really something. Zoho is already starting to embed some of its applications in others (I was using <a href="http://chat.zoho.com">Zoho Chat</a> in <a href="http://meeting.zoho.com">Zoho Meeting</a> last week - and then spotted that it will be possible to <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/announcements/announcing-zoho-meeting/">embed Zoho Meetings in a Zoho Presenter slide</a>.</p>

<p>[<em>Added</em>: with integrated tools and document sharing - Web O/S style - <em>as well as</em> the social linkages and permission structures/authentication offered by Facebook, I think the Facebook Platform is definitely worth watching. Institutions may not go for it (are they going for <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">Google or Microsoft hosted solutions</a>, for example?) but their students might. And those students  - as graduates -  might stick with it <em>after</em> they complete their studies. Many HEIs are trying to bolster charitable donations by developing alumni networks (rather than lifelong learning networks/communities....?) Maybe the students will create their own?]</p>

<p>Social bookmarking can now be embedded in Facebook via <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2378401597">ma.gnolia</a> and calendaring using <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2359167966">30 boxes</a>.</p>

<p>And just as I envisioned <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">Stringle</a>-like environments offering embedded, "in-LE" editors, the Facebook Platform offers this approach too: as it does with the <a href="http://www.f8.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2258014869">Picnik online photo editor</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Now here's your starter for 10: what would a Blackboard or Moodle Facebook application look like? Does it even make sense to ask that question?</p>

<p>Or are environments like Blackboard and Moodle 'platforms' in their own right? Albeit not ones you would ever choose to spend your time in?!;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</h3>

<p>Over the weekend, I noticed that MIT OpenCourseWare courses were offering a "Download this Course" option. Intrigued, I immediately grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a> course and had a poke around inside it.</p>

<p>The download bundle is - I guess(?!) - a standard (?) IMS  - err - package? (can you tell I'm not up on educational material interoperability standards?!;-)</p>

<p>That is to say, the zip archive file opens into a set of nested directories with an <em>imsmanifest.xml</em> document.  The archive file also contained copies of the HTML pages used on the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">course website</a> as well as the PDF versions of the course lecture notes.</p>

<p>What I <em>had</em> been hoping for was a 'clean' XML version of the course webpages (i.e. a single source document from which they had been generated). Some hope!</p>

<p>Anyway, my initial enthusiasm curbed somewhat, I felt there was still some mileage to be made in RSSifiying the course, for three main reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly to see if what came out was "sensible" - i.e. whether a feed based version of the course could be sensibly viewed in a <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> or <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a> environment, for example.</p>

<p>Secondly, to get a feeling for how to decompose a feed-delivered version of the course into separate component feeds.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to see whether those component feeds could be automatically generated from the IMS manifest, or scraped from the MIT OpenCourseware web pages.</p>

<p>The course - as published on the MIT OpenCourseWare website - is structured according to the course syllabus, readings, lecture notes, projects (i.e. group and individual activities) and related resources.</p>

<p><img alt="mitHTML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitHTML.png" width="802" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>As a first pass, I have generated an OPML version of the course that follows a similar structure. At the moment, this OPML feed is - to all intents and purposes - a monolithic feed. Over the coming weeks I intend to disaggregate it into separate component feeds that can be reaggregated in an OPML feed that pulls in separate OPML and RSS component feeds.</p>

<p>You can view the OPML version of the course here: <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=off&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo.opml">MIT OCW CMS610 Spring, 2006, Comparative Media (via Grazr)</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="mitOPML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitOPML.png" width="911" height="317" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that at the current time, some of the links (to New York Times) resources require a NYT login. I will patch these as and when I can. In addition, the links to audio-visual resources should really be made available via an embedded player, as well as link to the original site.</p>

<p>A cursory scan of the OpenCourseWare site suggests that the way individual web pages are composed across different courses is rather arbitrary, which will make scraping the site to automate feed production somewhat tricky.</p>

<p>I should be thankful for small mercies in the way OpenLearn content is bundled as XML I suppose!</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/resistance-is-fertile/">this is spot on</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</h3>

<!--
<p>At the request of the TU120 Course Team, I spent half an hour a couple of days ago extracting <em>by hand</em> the external links from the online course materials for the first week of <a href="http://ousefu;l.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>  and popping them into <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious</a>.</p>

<p>Although the materials are generated from XML source files (and so automated link extraction is trivial) I did it by hand partly to see what observations I could make about what sorts of information might be available to support the automated tagging and description of automatically extracted links.</p>

<p>A secondary aim was to see what thoughts occurred to me regarding the potential reuse of linkrolls/link collections, and the extent to which we could:</p>

<p>a)  provide linkrolls as part of an added value "product" to students;<br />
b) exploit linkrolls within a course as an additional navigation aid (for revision, or catchup);<br />
c) use linkrolls as a feed source for a course related customised search engine.</p>

<p>Anyway - here are the <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1">TU120 Week 1 links</a>, and here are a few things that came to mind as I was bookmarking them:</p>

<p>1) <em>Tagging is an issue:</em>: there are various sorts of tags we can use to mark up these external links:</p>

<p>I focussed <em>just</em> on organisational/course administration links for this exercise, using:</p>

<p>- section and subsection numbers (<a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1">1</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1.1">1.1</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1.2">1.2</a> etc;) but not subsubsection numbers; <br />
- an <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+activity">activity</a> tag for when a link was referenced in the context of an activity;<br />
- <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+maintext">maintext</a> when a link appeared in the main text of a section; and<br />
- <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+furtherReading">furtherReading</a> when a link appeared as an optional/further reading link.</p>

<p>I also tagged <em>all</em> the links as <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1+courseLink">courseLink</a> to show they were provided as part of the course materials.</p>

<p>My choice of tags was in part determined by the sorts of info that could be trivially automatically extracted from the course XML, because this sort of process should be automated if we are to offer course related link bundles more formally.</p>

<p>I didn't any 'semantic' tags; (sub)sections of the course are not semantically tagged either (even the XML markup is biassed towards presentation related tags, as you may guess if you've seen the OUschema that the OpenLearn course materials are being release as on the <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">Labspace</a> site).</p>

<p>It did occur to me that it may be possible to use services like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html">Yahoo's content analysis/tag extraction service</a> to offer tag suggestions for our content, but I haven't tried this yet. (There's another experiment for me to try with some OpenLearn content.. It would also be good if we could get visitors to the OpenLearn and Labspace sites tagging material? ;-)</p>

<p>It may also be interesting to use delicious (or other social bookmarking system) tag recommendations for a particular URL to help automate tag selection for particular URLs?</p>

<p>Ideally, though, external link bookmarks should be semantically tagged in a similar way to the context they appear in in the course materials/the section of the course content they came from. Semantic relations between links and the context they appear in within the course materials would then be preserved in a far more robust way that using section numbers: using tags like <em>1.1</em> are brittle, particularly if the content moves. Using tags like <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/example+cluster+searchengine"><em>example+cluster+searchengine</em></a> are far more robust, especially if that sort of sense can be extracted from the course material automatically.</p>

<p>2) <em>Delicious displays results in reverse chronological order.</em> I put the links into delcious in the order in  which they appeared in the course materials, so viewing them gives a reverse presentation order view; the same is true when you pull links out of delicious via a web feed; I don't know if this can be switched to chronological order? It's easy enough to write a script that would act as a relay and reverse the order of links, I guess, so there's yet another thig for the to do list...</p>

<p>3) The links can be made available in several ways</p>

<p> - exported as bookmarks/favourites into a browser (for example, using nested folders of bookmarks organised by section, topic,  or category), or viewed as live bookmarks;<br />
- displayed in a webtop like PageFlakes or  Netvibes, or viewed  in Grazr; for example, here are several ways of using an OPML bundle to provide <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/grazrNav.php?u=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120playground/tu120_1.opml&s=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">link navigation from a Grazr widget</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGrazr1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGrazr1.png" width="392" height="253" border="0" /></p>

<p>The navigation on the left actually shows different ways the links may be organised; note that when you  get to the links, they are in reverse order, as discussed above.</p>

<p>Here are a couple more Grazr views:</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGrazr.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGrazr.png" width="482" height="307" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGrazr2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGrazr2.png" width="445" height="336" border="0" /></p>

<p>4) It's easy enough getting the links out of delicious and putting them into a <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google custom search engine</a> like this <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3A6urthaytduc">TU120 search engine</a> (week 1 links only, at the moment):</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGoogle.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGoogle.png" width="397" height="425" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGoogle2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGoogle2.png" width="607" height="329" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr">searchfeedr</a> will also let you narrow the search down to 15 sites at a time, which would be ok for a section search; here's an example search over <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedrlabs.php?f=ouseful/usr:tu120+1.1&amp;q=september+11&t=d&se=y&s=pages">external links from  TU120 section 1.1</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="tu120Linkssearchfeedr.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120Linkssearchfeedr.png" width="1057" height="588" border="0" /></p>

<p>This exercise raised many more questions for me than it answered. For example, </p>

<p>a) how should we go about tagging link resources? One way might be to get students to add the semantic tags, and we could just provide architectural/administrative tagging? ;-)<br />
b) user scenarios: how might students use linkrolls? How should we organise, distribute, promote, embed and/or link to external link rolls, if at all?</p>

<p>That databases and other resource collections have value in their own right is well known.</p>

<p>As we move towards more and more online courses, with course authors presumably continuing to deep link into third party sites (even if we are only supposed to link to the top level of a domain ;-) I think its worth asking how the knowledge locked up in linkrolls/link collections can be unlocked, as well as exploring ways in which further value can be added.</p>

<p>PS having put the links into delicious, I also realised I should have used <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a>. Simpy offers private groups, which means we can keep our IP locked up, even if we do use a third party social bookmarking service ;-)<br />
PPS for newish readers to the blog who are interested in issues relating to the use of social bookmarking in formal education, you may be interested in reading <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">Towards a Managed Social Bookmarking Environment in Higher Education</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Messenger Doubles as Interesting Conference Application</h3>

<!--
<p>I had a demo of some bits of the OU's instant messenger service, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/about/">MSG</a> (pronounced 'em ess gee') I hadn't seen before from <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc Eisenstadt</a> last week.</p>

<p>The client is built as a lightweight, one click is all you have to application (though the list of possible new features seems to be creeping a little ;-). </p>

<p>The core functionality is already there, though, and will be appearing in the OpenLearn labspace as a prelude to integration (I presume) into the OU/Moodle VLE. For anyone in the OU in particular who is considering using instant messenging/synchronous comms in a course and <em>isn't</em> aware of what's going in in <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> at the moment, I urge you to take a look.</p>

<p><img alt="msg.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/msg.png" width="499" height="442" border="0" /></p>

<p>OU users can see MSG being trialled in the labspace area of <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> (note the site on that URL goes live on Oct. 25th; it can be viewed behind the OU firewall, but last time I looked gave an Apache holding page message if accessed from outside... (oops, chaps.... how about a holding page announcing the launch date or a redirect to <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk">oci.open.ac.uk</a>?).</p>

<p>MSG can be launched with a click from the Labspace front page (no client necessary), and authentication is handled for you using your OU or OpenLearn login credentials.</p>

<p><img alt="openlabspaceMSGlaunch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openlabspaceMSGlaunch.png" width="204" height="323" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://flashmeeting.com">Flashmeeting</a> rooms can also be launched/booked on spec if you need an a/v synchronous link.</p>

<p>Presence everywhere is one of the features that is being explored, with presence indicators that will appear next to the names of individuals registered on the same courses as you wherever their names appear. (Users can opt out of this if they want). Clicking on the user's name will then open a MSG window so you can chat to them.</p>

<p>Users are allocated to one or more groups and can only see lists of users who are also allocated to those groups.</p>

<p>I don't know how much presence info will be available on a personaised OpenLearn front page, but that would be THE place to get presence info for your buddies displayed...</p>

<p>At the moment MSG can only handle one-to-one messaging, although I believe a group chat is on the way, which would be useful for OU course use I think?</p>

<p>Closer integration of Flashmeeting and MSG is also on the cards, although how the UI will work out I'm not sure. The first step will see a Flashmeeting button in the MSG client, so chatters can breakout into a video room quickly and easily. Flashmeeting has its own chat facility, so Flashmeeting simply as a crude MSG bolt-on will raise some interesting usability questions (which chat client to use, for example).</p>

<p>One interesting application of MSG that Marc showed to me was it's use as a 'site-specific' messaging tool. <a href="http://www.eswc2006.org/technologies/chat.php">MSG was deployed at ESWC06</a></p>

<blockquote>MSG is a web application that ... [is] eminently suitable for use in environments where software installation is either difficult or annoying, or in ad-hoc short-lived group environments such as conferences. MSG is what we like to think of as a 'featureless' messenger: there are no parameters, no settings, no options, no groupchat - just a ready-made conference-only roster, simple presence states, and click-to-chat. ... [We are] committed to providing location information, and this lightweight interface enables users to select one out of several conference venues, including coffee, bar, and the main conference rooms, represented as a pure text string, so that contacts can locate one another quickly.</blockquote>

<p>All conference registrants were allocated a MSG account, and each emailed a pin (personal identification number) that they could use to access their account. User groups were created based on a) all registrants; and b) interest groups (using information that was presumably collected during the conference registration process, or scraped from special sessions the delegates had signed up for).</p>

<p>Whilst signing into the MSG client, the users could specifiy their location. MSG does have map integration (so users can be shown at a particular location on a map) but I'm not sure if this featured in the ESWC06 trial.</p>

<p><img alt="msglocation.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/msglocation.png" width="372" height="454" border="0" /></p>

<p>I know that Brian Kelly at UKOLN has been demoing services like <a href="http://gabbly.com">gabbly</a> chat as a way of creating <em>ad hoc</em> online chat rooms at conferences, but this approach offers a bit more privacy. The lack of a group chat faclity may be an issue, but I think for delegates wanting to take an opportunity to make contact with other attendees at a conference, MSG could be very useful.</p>

<p>I don't know how well used MSG was at ESWC06, but will try and find out...</p>

<p>(The script is named as it is because I had a peek of the new-and-still-in-testing <http://oci.open.ac.uk">OCI/openlearn</a> Moodle installation today, and originally wrote the script for that:-)</p>

<p>A couple of obvious issues - the size of the iframe is not right. I tried to dynamically resize it by looking at the scrollheight and scrollwidth of the iframe, but couldn't get my code to work (It's late, I'm tired...), so if anyone has the solution, please let me know.</p>

<p>There's also a fudge to select where the ifram goes - I hard coded it in to go at the top of the left hand frame, identified by peeking at the page HTML and finding the <em>id</em> attribute of the panel I wanted my frame to go above.</p>

<p>Other things that need doing - the layout needs tidying up, removing the frame borders maybe?</p>

<p>The widgets on the widgetbox panel would probably need sizing to fit in with the Moodle set up you  know you're going to be working with.</p>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>If you want to play, get a <a href="http://widgetbox.com">widgetbox</a> account, create a panel, get the URL of the script that generates it and paste it in to the appropriate spot (after <em>var wbURL=</em> and in quotes) in the  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ociSquirt.user.js">Greasemonkey script</a>.</p>

<p>You may also want to place the script elsewhere by changing the <em>squirtPoint</em>, whcih should be set to the id of the Moodle panel <em>above which</em> you want the Widgetbox panel to appear.</p>

<p>If anyone out there has access to other locked down VLEs and can knock up an equivalent script, let me know and I'll link to it from here.</p>

<p>Also, if anyone can tid up my script, please let me know:-)</p>

<p>This all reminds me of the  <a href="http://www.ntk.net">Need to Know</a> strapline: <em>THEY STOLE OUR <s>REVOLUTION</s> <strong>LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</strong>. NOW WE'RE STEALING IT BACK</em> ;-)</p>

<p>I've just been having a play with <a href="http://widgetbox.com">WidgetBox</a> and now have a way of easily getting my own widgets into Moodle - for Firefox users at least - whether or nor sys admin want me to :-)</p>

<p>A clearinghouse for widgets, Widgetbox users subscribe to widgets from the Widgetbox gallery:</p>

<p><img alt="wbSubscriptions.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wbSubscriptions.jpg" width="643" height="221" border="0" /></p>

<p>If necessary, the widget can then be configured:</p>

<p><img alt="wb_deliSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wb_deliSearch.jpg" width="643" height="450" border="0" /></p>

<p>As well as widget subscriptions, users can create one or more <em>panels</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="wbPanel.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wbPanel.jpg" width="637" height="187" border="0" /></p>

<p>Subscribed to widgets can then be placed on the panel as required:</p>

<blockquote>Adjust the panel settings to change the format of the panel. To add widgets or text blocks, drag and drop them from the Item Palette to the Panel Layout. Text blocks allow you to add small bits of plain text or HTML to your panel.</blockquote> 

<p><img alt="wbPanelConfig.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wbPanelConfig.jpg" width="652" height="395" border="0" /><br />
 <br />
No matter how many widgets you want, there is just a single script element - defining the appropriate panel -  to place in the web page you want to install the widgets on.</p>

<p>Rearranging the order of the widgets in the panel is simply a case of dragging and dropping them to the correct location.</p>

<p>And if you tire of a widget, it's easy to remove it - just drag it off the panel in your widgetbox control panel.</p>

<p>The single script include element also means its easy to write a Greasemonkey script (and hence Firefox extension) or cross-browser bookmarklet to inject the widgetbox panel script element into a Moodle sidebar.</p>

<p>At which point, all the widgets placed on that panel will appear in the Moodle sidebar.</p>

<p>Adding widgets like the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr OPML Browser</a> to a VLE, whether via widgetbox or by adding it separately, also provides the user with control over the feeds they can view in the environment if: a) they are able to configure the OPML feed consumed by the Grazr widget, and b) they are able to determine the structure and contents of that feed, for example by using a 3rd party feed management tool such as <a href="http://feedcollectors.com/">Feed Collectors</a> or <a href="http://www.opmlworkstation.com/">OPML Workstation</a>.</p>

<p>So - even if VLE customisation is locked down by the sysadmins - browser extensions will let you retake control:-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Another Take on PLEs</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the stances I take towards PLEs is (not surprisingly) that they are in some sense amenable to personalisation. Tinkering with my <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">VLE Library demo</a> 'course' just now (if you aren't of the OU and you want a guest ticket, mail me, and I'll see what I can do)  I started wondering about the extent to which instructors are allowed to add widgets of their own choosing to the VLEs in their own institutions, or whether they can only incorporate modules from an 'approved list'; or maybe whether they have to go to someone in their academic computing service who looks after the VLE, and asks them to configure a course with the various optional functional modules that are supported.</p>

<p>What prompted this thought was this agenda item for the forthcoming <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/UK_MoodleMoot_06_hackfest">Moodle Moot hackfest</a></p>

<blockquote>Page-Based Chat Roster and Whiteboard

<p>The COVCELL project is developing a chat module (based on jabber) for Moodle. Chat rosters are to be generated on a per-page basis, so that anyone who is logged in and is viewing a particular page will be able to see who else is viewing that page and start a chat session with them. Group chat will be supported and it will be possible to use a whiteboard (based on Coccinella) in the chat.</p>

<p>More information can be found at:</p>

<p>    * http://covcell.cms.hu-berlin.de/tracov/wiki/Phase_I<br />
    * http://covcell.org/ <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Err - 2 minutes later - like this <a href="http://gabbly.com">embedded Gabbly chat box</a>, perhaps?</p>

<p><img alt="moodleGabbly1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/moodleGabbly1.jpg" width="401" height="353" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="moodleGabbly2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/moodleGabbly2.jpg" width="350" height="335" border="0" /></p>

<p>(Hmm - that <a href="http://feed.gabbly.com/vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id">Gabbly feed from Library VLE Demo page</a> suggests a security issue to me... the page requires authentication to get in, but the feed is public. Also, the address of the feed appears to be <em>http://feed.gabbly.com/vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id</em>, and the same adress is given for the actual chat box. Now my course is actually <em>id=69</em>...so I wonder - if someone on another course had a Gabbly chat box, would we share the same discussion? i.e. will Gabbly only act Moodle installation wide, and not within particular pages?<br />
 <br />
Okay - so maybe Gabbly chat can't be used out of the can as a page based chat roster (or maybe it could if there was a sensible and informative URL/addressing structure in Moodle?) For the sake of 35 mins installation, and 20 mins blog posting (!), I think it was worth it though...</p>

<p>Anyway - what this suggests to me is that maybe there is another dimension to the *LEs? That is, environments that support the inclusion of arbitrary HTML/js widgets that are not neceassrily part of the VLE configuration?</p>

<p>To my mind, these look set to take off this year, e.g. with the impending <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/">widgetbox</a> widget exchange (I love a phrase in their elevator pitch - <em>syndicating functionality</em>) or <a href="http://snipperoo.com/">Snipperoo universal widget</a> (see also the <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2783">ZDNet post</a>).</p>

<p>So how about thinking about PLEs in this way - as envirnments in whcih a) instructors and/or b) students are allowed to include gadgets/widgets in the environment if they so wish?</p>

<p>For example, at the moment I'm adding all sorts of gadgets to my Moodle account - and I hope the demo VLE continues to allow me that freedom.</p>

<p>But several questions arise:</p>

<p>1) in the production environment, will course team members be allowed to add artbitrary HTML content to their Moodle course directly?</p>

<p>2) will CT members be allowed to add <em>Javascript</em> enriched pages to their course?</p>

<p>3) will CT members be allowed to embed 3rd party HTML/js widgets to their course?</p>

<p>PS Hmmm - maybe they'll follow the MySpace approach...:</p>

<blockquote>MySpace has taken a step to increase security that disables a key method for third party vendors to spread their services inside the online social network. The company is using new code in a new version of flash that disables outgoing links from flash widgets and it is pushing users to install the blockable version of flash by requiring that they do so in order to view MySpace hosted video.
...
Just as javascript has been unusable in MySpace, most flash objects are also now unable to link out to third party sites when viewed with Flash player 9.
...
This means that the “get this widget” function so key to the viral spread of a growing industry of MySpace widgets will soon be unavailable.</blockquote>

<p>...or maybe #2 and #3?</p>

<p>An increasing number of courses are looking at embedding audio snippets into course materials. So just out of curiousity, I wondered whether the VLE Demo had embedded media filters enabled, that scan a page for media links (mp3, for example) and make them inline playable. From a quick test, it seems they are enabled (a flash player definitely is pulled in to the page) but broken (for me at least):</p>

<p><img alt="moodleGrip2brokenaudio.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/moodleGrip2brokenaudio.jpg" width="642" height="138" border="0" /></p>

<p>Ah well, maybe it's my browser not playing - can I get the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/playtagger">delioious playtagger</a> to work (it's the same principle, search for mp3s and bring an embedded Flash player into the page to play them):</p>

<p><img alt="moodlegripe3sholuldwork.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/moodlegripe3sholuldwork.jpg" width="638" height="119" border="0" /></p>

<p>So it's the Moodle player embedding code appears to be broken... (I could try and find out why, but hey - not my job;-) Maybe someone else will fix it some time..? Anyway, here's the gripe - and it's one I've come across before...</p>

<p>If you put a script in a Moodle edited web page that manipulates the DOM and adds stuff to the page (like the play button image that the delicious script inserted), when you edit the page it is loaded into a WYSIWYG page editor...which runs the script, and manipulates the page in the context of the editor; so now the code for the image is part of the document being edited, and if you save the page, that code will be saved too. Meaning that the next time you run the page you will have <em>two</em> images; one from the code that  was inserted  by the WYSIWYG editor, one that is dynamically added when the page loads and the script runs.</p>

<p>Each time you edit the page, another element is added:</p>

<p><img alt="moddlegripe2edit.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/moddlegripe2edit.jpg" width="688" height="254" border="0" /></p>

<p>So this is my Moodle gripe #2: the page editor defaults to WYSIWYG and runs any scripts you have in the page being editied.</p>

<p>So I wonder - is there any way of either setting a preference for the editor so that by default it shows the code view, or that disables the rich text editor altogether (I never use it, personally - I'd rather write the HTML tags myself).</p>

<p>PS for internal readers, I'm trying all sorts of embeddable stuff out in Moodle at <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">VLE Library Demo</a>. I've also opened it up to <em>guests</em> who have a key - mail me if you want the key...</p>

<h3 class="title">Moodle Gripes  #1</h3>

<!--
<p>A week away at summer school, and it's sooooooooo hard getting back into the blogging routine..</p>

<p>Anyway - a gentle start: here is the first of what I guess will be many Moodle gripes as I start to play with a demo course in the current <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk">VLE sandpit</a> (mine's <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">VLE Library Demo</a> if you want to check it out - OU authentication required, I suspect...).</p>

<p>Mumble #1: to reorder panels on the screen you have to use up, down and sidways arrows, moving the block one step at a time... Needless to say, new blocks are added at the bottom of the  column, which makes for a slow and painful seriesd of clicks to move a panel up to the top.</p>

<p>It's at times like this I realise how much I like drag and drop, as in <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> or <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/dd/dd2.php">MyOpenLibrary (Web 2.0 style alpha)</a>.</p>

<p>(There are so many toolkits out there now that make this thing easy, I found I've come to expect this... Hmm - there's a <a href="http://moodlemoot.org/">Moodlemoot here next week</a>  - I wonder if they have a hackfest as part of it? If so, I wonder what the chances are of someone pulling  together a prototype/scriptaculous (or similar) js toolkit/framework for Moodle? Hmm - it seems <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/UK_MoodleMoot_06_hackfest">they do have a hackfest</a>, but there's nothing interesting suggested ;-)</p>

<p>And before anyone says it's a low spec browser compatibility thing for the students, <em>users can't reorder the layout of the blocks on the screen...</em></p>

<p>...which may or may not be another grumble in its own right...</p>

<p>Ah well, the Moodle interface isn't supposed to be a whizzy <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/11/30-boxes-launches-webtop-service/">webtop</a> is it?</p>

<p>PS my first doodles were to add <a href="http://grazr.com/">Grazr</a>, <a href="http://www.mindsack.com/?page_id=45">SpiffySearch</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005877.html">Embeddable deliSearch</a> into separate HTML panels. First impression is they seem to work okay, though it would be handy if the system offered a way of autoloading a specified stylesheet to handle any styling quirks required within the block...</p>
