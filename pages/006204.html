<h3 class="title">If We Really Had Global Pretensions for Web2.OU...</h3>

<p>...we'd have someone involved in <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">Wax</a>, wouldn't we? (After all, Higher Education is now an industry, isn't it?)</p>

<p>(The main reason I'm blogging this is to keep a record of the <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">list of attendees</a>, just in case...)</p>

<p>And just by the by - here's a handy list of what I guess is a large part of the UK 'web 2.0 developer community' - the <a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/webapps/member/index.cgi?attendee_list">list of attendees from the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Carson Systems' <em>Future of Web Apps</em> Summit</a>. (NB Podcasts of presentations from the Summit are available. If you weren't there, they're worth a listen...)</p>

<p>As this is turning into a link post, here's some more workshop related stuff that looks like it may be interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/ucisa-ukoln-cetis-2006/handouts/">Handouts</a> from the UCISA/UKOLN/CETIS Workshop 2006 on <em>Initiatives & Innovation: Managing Disruptive Technologies</em>.</p>

<p>The forthcoming <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/">Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006: Quality Matters</a> Workshop. As an institution that supports an online student body that I guess peaked at around 200, 000 registered students, and that has committed to requiring all registered students to participate in web based learning activities within the next couple of years, I am always surprised when there is <em>not</em> someone from the OU talking about what we've acheived and how we've made it scale...</p>

<p>Also upcoming is <a href="http://incsub.org/edublog/">blog.ac.uk</a> a conference (or <em>un</em>conference?) which is:</p>

<blockquote>structured around two framework themes. These cut across the educational sectors and are crucial to life-long education provision that meets the needs and abilities of all learners - provision that is vital to empower learners as citizens within multiple communities and in preparing the UK to participate creatively, technologically and economically on a global scale.

<p>1. Deployment of weblogs and related technologies within educational institutions and the learning and teaching environment: navigating risk (morning sessions)</p>

<p>2. Blogging as community practice: impact of weblogs on current and future Personal Learning Environments (afternoon sessions).</blockquote></p>

<p>I hope to go...mail me if you're going and want to meet up.</p>
