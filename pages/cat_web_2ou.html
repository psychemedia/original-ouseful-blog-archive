<p>This one's for <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44712">Downes</a>... ;-)</p>

<p>Taking a break yesterday from blitzing a whole set of posts to the <a href="http://visualgadgets.blogspot.com">Visual Gadgets course un-unit (<em>sic</em>) blog experiment</a>, I did a back of an envelope calculation (with a bit of sanity checking from Jon Rosewell and <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/openair/index.php">Laura D</a> [hmm - we have new internal blog URLs... "http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/openair/"]) relating to how much revenue the OU gets "per web page view" for delivering online teaching materials.</p>

<p>That is, if we saw ourselves as web publishers, and we made money from page views/click thrus, what levels of traffic do we need to generate to make the same revenue from 'learning content' pages as we do currently?</p>

<p>Taking the Relevant Knowledge short courses as an example (e.g. <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google</a>, or <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu189">T189 Digital Photography</a>), here's an order of magnitude calculation for a 10 week level 1 short course, that takes approximately 10 hours of student time per week to complete.</p>

<p>Assume that the course content pages are what brings the revenue in, not other services (such as assessment, support, etc etc).</p>

<blockquote><h3>Lifetime revenue of each page</h3>Number of 'teaching' web pages per week: 20
Number of weeks per presentation: 10
Number of students per cohort: 200
Number of presentations of course: 10

<p>Number of unique views: 20 x 10 x 200 x 10 = 400,000 (400K) unique views.</p>

<p>Course fee 150 UKP<br />
HEFCE funding&nbsp; 250 UKP (?)<br />
Number of students per cohort: 200<br />
Number of presentations of course: 10</p>

<p>Total Revenue: (150 + 250) UKP x 200 x 10 = 800,000 (800K) UKP</p>

<p>That is, over its life, the page needs to generate of the order 4K UKP (200 x 10 x 2 UKP).</p>

<p><hr><h3>Revenue per student page view</h3>Number of 'teaching' web pages per week: 20<br />
Number of weeks per presentation: 10<br />
Number of unique views per presentation: 200<br />
Course fee 150 UKP<br />
HEFCE funding 250 UKP (?)<br />
Revenue per presentation 400 UKP<br />
Revenue per student page view: 2 UKP (400 UKP / 200)</p>

<p><hr><h3>Annual course revenue - via CPC</h3>Revenue per student page view: 2UKP<br />
Two presentations per year, 200 students per presentation<br />
2 x 200 x 400 UKP =160K UKP per year.<br />
For each page, 2 x 200 x 2 UKP = 800 UKP per year.</p>

<p>Suppose instead we publish 200 'public' pages per year, (say 1 per day for 200 good days per year - imagine, for example, an open content  course wiki, which has to be self sustaining, and within which we can manage  to post 1 page per day) we need to generate 800 UKP *per page* to make 160K UKP back in that year. For a click thru rate (CTR) on revenue generating clicks of 0.1%, at 0.8 UKP per click (PC) we need 1M impressions *per page* over that year (since 1M x 0.8 UKP x 0.001 = 800 UKP). For CTR of 0.1%, at 0.08 UKP PC we need 10M impressions *per page*...</p>

<p><hr><h3>CPM (cost per thousand) rates</h3>If we were to sell ads on a CPM basis to generate the same revenue that course content pages bring in, the total CPM take per page would be 2K UKP. On a UK newspaper website, the ratecards for ads are of order 15UKP - 30UKP. So we are two orders of magnitude above that (assuming the CPM is for an 'exclusive' ad deal; if there are 10 ads on the page, we are one order of magnitude more costly - but we don't get the volume on the page impressions... (we are at 2 orders of magnitude (?) down on volume).</p>

<p><hr><h3>Timeliness - securing equivalent lifetime revenues per page, within a year</h3>Suppose we want to achieve the same lifetime revenue from a web page in a course that is presented twice a year for five years, within a single year. (That is, we create the same amount of content per uncourse, but need to reclaim an equivalent course lifetime revenue with one year, rather than five. (Why? We assume the content dates over the course of a year..)</p>

<p>If we generate revenue at 2 UKP per click through, and CTR of 0.1%, we need 2M impressions to generate 4K UKP.  If we assume 200 effective page viewing days per year, then to generate 4K UKP in 1 year we need 10k impressions per page per day.</p>

<p>If we generate revenue at 0.2 UKP per click through, and CTR of 0.1%, we need 20M impressions to generate 4K UKP. If we assume 200 effective page viewing days per year, then to generate 4K in 1 year we need 100k impressions per page per day.</p>

<p>If we generate revenue at 0.02 UKP per click through, and CTR of 0.1%, we need 200M impressions to generate 4K UKP. If we assume 200 effective page viewing days per year, then to generate 4K UKP in 1 year we need 1M impressions per page per day.</p>

<p><hr><h3>Equivalent CT/CPC Rates</h3>(Thanks to Laura for this one...)</p>

<p>Suppose that rather than course fee/HEFCE income, each course page needed to be self sustaining through click thrus on affiliate links.</p>

<p>To achieve an equivalent page lifetime revenue income of 4K UKP at a CPC of 2 UKP we would need 2000 CTs on affiliate links.</p>

<p>If each page needs to generate 4K from affiliate links, you would need to have every student (cohort size 200) over the 10 presentations click once on an affiliate link on every page of the course. </p>

<p>If the CPC was worth 0.2 UKP, every student would have to click on 10 affiliate links per page to achieve 2K CTs. </blockquote><br />
Here are a couple more thoughts about the amounts of revenue each page can bring in under different revenue generatng models.</p>

<p>CPM - order of 20 UKP PM, so 0.02UKP PPV<br />
CPC - order of 0.2UKP PC<br />
CPA - (cost per action, cf. revenue per Amazon affiliate link sale) order of 2UKP PA<br />
CPP - "cost per presentatation"(!) - order of 200 UKP<br />
CPL - "cost per lifetime" of course - order of 2K UKP</p>

<p>What's missing in the above blend is a transaction of the order 20 UKP - and maybe this could open up a new business model that balances revenue generation per page with an achievable number of unique content pages and sensible page view volumes?<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/revenue" rel="tag">revenue</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/socialearn" rel="tag">socialearn</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>For the last couple of months, a small team (nothing to do with me...) have been putting together an OU presence on iTunes U - and very slick it looks too (well done, folks :-): <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/itunes/">visit the Open University on iTunes U</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/itunes/" title="visit the Open University on iTunes U"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/2547308475_ebabe8ba95.jpg" alt="OU on iTunes U" height="380" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I had a look at the site yesterday afternoon, thanks to an internal tip off via delicious, no less, but when I asked if I was free to blog, I was asked to keep quiet until the press release - and the official announcement - came out today...</p>

<p>It seems that the media relations team also team took a hard line with respect to not tipping anyone off early, including the press... (or maybe we don't do embargoed press releases?)</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7431918.stm" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2132/2547284093_f5cfd2c203.jpg" alt="iTunes U in the UK (BBC)" height="263" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Here's the fuill press release: <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=13805">The Open University offers free education content on iTunes U in the iTunes Store</a>.</p>

<p>It's probably worth bearing in mind that the rules of PR 1.0 probably still hold true, especially if you don't let the web 2.0 channels prime the story using niche channels... because otherwise, you can lose control of the story:</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dougclow/statuses/825863405" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2547296345_0938f14f03.jpg" alt="2008-06-03_1157" height="155" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Maybe I should have published yesterday and been damned? Note that the story has now been amended, although the OU (at time of writing) still doesn't get a link:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7431918.stm" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2548109790_05d63c7d76.jpg" alt="2008-06-03_1149" height="155" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>(What was it the recent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/framework/bbc_service_licences/bbc_co_uk.html">BBC Trust report on  said about 'must do better' with respect to linking to third party sites?</a>)</p>

<p>So here's what the OU iTunes site looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browsev2/itunes.open.ac.uk" title="OU on iTunesU"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2165/2548137670_7e80743de2.jpg" alt="OU on iTunesU" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Unlike many of the other institutional offerings there, the OU presence includes broadcast and near-broadcast quality video from several of our courses, as well as talking head videos from the great and the good.</p>

<p>For example, here are the offerings from one of the courses from my own department:</p>

<p><a href="https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browsev2/itunes.open.ac.uk" title="OU ICT on iTunes U"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3043/2547317309_d3135d4dbf.jpg" alt="OU ICT on iTunes U" height="308" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Note that as well as video, the transcripts are also made available... And of course, the content is <em>free</em>... At the moment, I don't think there is any regular 'podcast' programming included - hopefully I'll have more to post about that in the near future... ;-)</p>

<p>PS Stuart has also pointed out that the iTunes offering is just part of a wider straegy to engage with social media. As Stuart writes in <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/SocialCommunications/?p=214">iTunes U and the OU</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This work sits alongside ongoing work with YouTube, and activity in spaces such as Facebook, Netvibes, Twitter etc. This is going to be brought together via a <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/use/">/use</a> site [which] will serve as a landing page for those people visiting the OU from external web spaces and introduce them to what else is on offer. The current /use page is all we are able to offer at the moment; it will be much better in the future!</p>

<p>So, what's the coherent story around the OU's activity in these third-party spaces? Well i think it's partly captured by the intro text on /use; itâ€™s about allowing people to make use of OU content for their own purposes (breaking down the us / them boundaries), it's about letting people experience what the OU has to offer in the social spaces that they already feel comfortable with and not focusing solely on driving them to a corporate website, and it's about being a genuine and valuable part of online communities.</blockquote><br />
Anyway, here are the links again: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/itunes/">visit the Open University on iTunes U</a>, and <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/use/">/use</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas for other content we should be making available via iTunes U, or you can think of innovative ways we might be able to use that channel, why not post a suggestion to the <a href="http://ou.ideascale.com">(unofficial) OU suggestion box</a>?</p>

<p>PPS anyone interested in a little bet about when, or indeed, if, the iTunes U OU presence gets a mention on <a href="http://open2.net">open2.net</a>?</p>

<p>PPPS it seems open2 is on the case after all:</p>

<!--
<p>There's a <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/socialearn/">SocialLearn</a> steering group meeting next week, and as part of the document preparation for it <a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a> has tried to get us thinking about potential business models;-)</p>

<p>So to try and get myself in the zone for mulling such things over on a dog walk, here's a list of models off the top of my head...<br />
<br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Advertising models</span><br />
<ul><li>CPM (cost-per-thousand) ad impressions (banners, text ads, etc. etc)</li><li>PPC (pay-per-click ads - maybe via e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a>)</li><li>PPA (pay-per-action)</li></ul>Ads can be run as a 3rd party publisher (e.g. via Adsense) or by selling ad space/inventory (cf. sponsorship).</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sponsorship</span><br />
To my mind, this is ad-selling as much as anything... The difficult part is getting the ad-inventory/sponsorship.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Affiliate deals (cf. PPA)</span><br />
<ul><li>Books (e.g Amazon affiliates; cf. the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">OpenLearn_daily aStore</a>);</li><li>Jobs/recruitment (e.g. ?)</li><li>Courses (e.g. ?learndirect)<br />
</li></ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Upselling/subscription</span><br />
Offer a free basic service then upsell. Ideally, users should even be able to play with some of the apps without registering, but before they can do something really useful, they then need to register (i.e. a <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/pattern/LazyRegistration">lazy registration design pattern</a>).</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Transaction Fees (B2B)</span><br />
e.g. make businesses pay for bulk operations over the platform. If the platform acts as an aggregator, it may be that the platform also pays a commission feed to data orginators as a license condition of aggregating their data?</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pay-for-access/Licensing</span><br />
e.g. charge businesses who generate business on you platform; e.g. levy a license fee if they build apps that use your platform; metered access for users and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">generators</span> of traffic? (so e.g. if you build an app that makes frequent demands of my API, I'm gonna charge you for it (maybe Twitter should do this - let other people monetise at a B2C level and charge the app builders for client access to the API at metered or bulk B2B rates?)</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Data Vending &amp; Data Related Value Add Services</span><br />
<ul><li>data mining aggregated data and selling the insights?</li><li>recommendation services (e.g. people who X'd also Y'd);</li><li>selling on recommendations (lead generation, selling people's contact info in particular demographics etc)<br />
</li></ul><br />
Also related to business models, maybe, are the questions of 'recruitment and retention'. Word-of-mouth personal recommendations <span style="font-style: italic;">at scale</span> is probably one of the most effective ways of building users (as opposed to just traffic), so maybe we need some features that accommodate a 'viral growth sharing design pattern'? e.g. user invites for participating in collaborative activities (though again maybe with lazy registration?)</p>

<p>A quick google also turns up the following:</p>

<p> "<a href="http://www.technosight.com/web-20-business-models/">Web 2.0 Business models (Technosight)</a>" refers to the following diagram, which is maybe also worth mulling over:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technosight.com/web-20-business-models/" title="Web 2.0 Business models (Technosight)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2084/2524953662_834bd8e57f.jpg" alt="http://www.technosight.com/web-20-business-models/" height="416" width="457" /></a></p>

<p>The story so far... the first time I saw our current VC at a 'meet the troops' session several years ago, someone suggested during the Q&A session at the end that a 'suggestion box' scheme might not be a bad idea for helping support (attempts at) innovation within the OU... several years on, and, err....</p>

<p>Anyway, over on Stuart's Social Communications blog today, I was overjoyed to see his post about about  <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=177">OU IdeaScale</a>, a vote 'em up, vote 'em down suggestion box courtesy of Ideascale.</p>

<p>For those of you not keeping up at the back there, I think it was Dell who a year or so ago started the current round of 'listen to the customer' suggestion boxes with their bespoke <a href="http://ideastorm.com/">IdeaStorm</a> website.</p>

<p><a href="http://ideastorm.com/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2242/2435407304_3cf1b4c4de.jpg" width="500" height="377" alt="dell ideastorm"  style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>More recently, Starbucks released what may well be a mashup suggestion box site on the Salesforce platform: <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/home/home.jsp">My Starbucks Idea</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/home/home.jsp" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2435405036_afc7cf0f2d.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="my starbucks idea"  style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>Ideascale moves the game on by offering a hosted, generic solution to setting up your own online suggestion box. Whilst the interface, user registration and moderation tools still need a bit of work, it looks like it could be quite fun... ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://ou.ideascale.com/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2435400626_09e67128f3.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="Ideascale" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>To see the OUtrageous* suggestion box, visit <a href="http://ou.ideascale.com/">http://ou.ideascale.com/</a>.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure how long it'll remain there, though - the service is in beta only for a short time, and may then introduce a payment plan (which really should be for the white label, skin-it-yourself version, IMHO) - but who knows... maybe it'll be around long enough to catch a good idea or two...?! ;-) And even then, if a payment plan <em>is</em> enforced for the service...? Well, who knows? If the site is generating traffic, interest and ideas, what price do we put on a good idea?)</p>

<p>One thing I'd be interested to see appearing on the site would be future course suggestions, just to get a feeling for how crowd intelligence might be used to inform our curriculum planning activities, if nothing else?</p>

<p>I've posted before about how <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">search powered prediction markets</a> might also be used to help us identify possibly attractive courses, so maybe it's time to think about that possibility again too.... (prediction markets themselves keep hitting the news at the moment because <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html">Google has been using them</a>)hmmm (thinks), Stuart mentioned that our Site Intelligence web analytics tool has archived data going back some time...hmmm, again... do I maybe feel a model coming on?! That said, most of the prediction market apps I had bookmarked appear to have deadpooled... what does that say about them, I wonder? ;-) This one still seems to be around though: <a href="http://inklingmarkets.com/">Inkling Markets</a> and this project may still be active: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zocalo/">Zocalo</a>)</p>

<p><small>*OUtrageOUs = unofficial, public facing, OU related webservice that's such a good idea that it can't not be done - so it has been... act first, get permission later... if permission is refused, someone will probably set up an equivalent "fake OU" service anyway...</small></p>

<h3 class="title">People You May Know - Time to Dig Out Some Graph Theory Books...</h3>

<!--
<p>Tool meme of the week in the bit of the social web I inhabit seems to be the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/_nexus_/">Nexus</a> Facebook application, which just seems to be a prettier version of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendwheel/">friendwheel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2369826952/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2198/2369826952_5637786dc4.jpg" alt="nexus friends analysis" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="399" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This graph is that subset of the social graph Facebook knows about that I can see...</p>

<p>Possibly of  more interest, though, is the "People You May Know" feature that Facebook have just rolled out (<a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/03/26/facebook-starts-suggesting-people-you-may-know/">Facebook starts suggesting 'People You May Know'&#65533;</a>), a clone, apparently, of a Linked In service (<a href="http://blog.adamnash.com/2008/01/03/people-you-may-know-on-linkedin/">People You May Know on Linked In</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2368987635/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/2368987635_42658f9108.jpg" alt="people you may know" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="303" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the above, what Facebook appears to be doing is recommending people to me who have a high number of edges in their social graph that connect to nodes (people) that are also in my social graph. Referring back to the Nexus view of my friends netowrk, the recommended friends are people who would not be out of place in my graph, and would be highly connected (i.e. have a high edge count) within it.</p>

<p>I guess one of the simplest (i.e. most literal) ways of identifying these friends is to do something like this:</p>

<p>- over all of my friends, build a list of unique people they have befriended (who are not already my friends);<br />
- count the number of times each person in the list is friended by people who I know;<br />
- if the number is larger than N, recommend that person to me as someone I may know, on the grounds that they know several of the people I know. </p>

<p>I wonder if another way of calculating it would be to look at the Facebook social graph, knock out all the links that connect me to my friends and that connect my friends to each other, and then recommend back to me the people who have the highest closeness, or, err, betweenness on the pruned graph between the people who are my friends?</p>

<p>(I really need to brush up on, extend and deepen my knowledge of graph theory and network analysis! (I have a load of old notes on social bookmark tagging looked at as matrices, somewhere...?) Here are few ways in to the vocab at least, maybe? <a href="http://20bits.com/2007/11/02/graph-theory-part-iii-facebook/">Graph Theory: Part III (Facebook)</a>; <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/mb021/graphtheory.htm">Introduction to Network Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2386029/report">Representation of Online Social Networks</a>. Though it pains me to say so, I may need to leave the blogosphere and hit the literature for a bit... now where did I put all those original small world network papers from Newman, Watts et al.? ;-) Anyone interested in getting an informal study group together, maybe? ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, just to note it so I don't forget it, when I saw the Facebook 'people you may know' results page, I immediately wondered whether there might be mileage in exploring this approach in the context of Course Profiles, using <em>course codes</em> to identify potential closeness of relationship with people I don't already know? (i.e. offering enhancements to, or refinements of, the current Study Buddy and Course Recommender services?</p>

<p>For example, for students who had declared the same courses and the same presentation dates for more than one course, we might be able to recommend "people you may remember studying with" (we'd have to have a privacy setting to out of this, of course).</p>

<p>For students who had taken, are taking and intend to take the same courses at similar times, we might be able to recommend potentially long lasting study friendships along the lines of "people who may be on the same course pathway as you". Where the courses (and ordered sequence of courses) is the same as someone else, but the dates are different, the recommendations may be of the form "people who have previously taken a similar pathway to you" and "people who are intending to take a similar pathway to the one you took/are taking" (that is, identifying mentoring or 'old hand' relationships between people at opposite ends of a qualification pathway).</p>

<p>[It's important to note here that I see Course Profiles as providing access to a graph, in part through app specific data, in part through access to Facebook data, that has two sorts of node (people and courses) and three sorts of edge (course-course, course-person, person-person), each of which may have several possible flavours. On different views over the graph, some of the edges may be directed (e.g. 'this course taken <em>after</em> that course') and ordered into lists (sequences of courses in the order they are taken, for example), and some may be weighted (e.g. '23 people took this course <em>at the same time as</em> that course, or 'this person is taking that 30 point course' (I don't know if properties of one class of node should be exposed as the weight of an edge when connected to a node of another class, but hey, it's something to learn about, right?!;-).]</p>

<p>Now ,do I start tinkering with my Python/Course Profiles analysis code again and see if I can get some 'people you may have known' code working, or do I fire up the Quattro and catch up on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/ashestoashes/">Ashes to Ashes</a>?<br />

<h3 class="title">Local Facebook Apps for Local People... How many Users?</h3>

<!--
<p>In preparing the Higher Ed Experts talk I gave today, I started thinking about the size, scope and likely audience of our <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&amp;search=%22OU%20course%20profiles%20facebook%20app%22">Course Profiles Facebook app</a>, compared to an app designed "to attract the largest number of users as quickly as possible", as was the case with "Kiss Me", another of the apps covered in the <a href="http://www.higheredexperts.com/webinar/en/webinars/?tx_seminars_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=15">Facebook Applications webinar series</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to mention is that Course Profiles was built originally to appeal to current OU students who were already on Facebook. Looking at the OU Facebook Network page today, I noticed there were just over 6,000 members. Since membership of an academic network requires the user to have an email address for that institution, this number - 6,000 or so users - is thus likely to be less than then number of actual OU students who are on Facebook.</p>

<p>Membership of a network is automatic if you have registered on Facebook with a particular email address. Institutions can also set up a public profile page on Facebook that <span style="font-style: italic;">anyone</span> can see and anyone can associate with by becoming a <span style="font-style: italic;">fan</span> of the page. At the time of writing, just over 5,500 people have fanned the Open University on Facebook. I'm guessing this set overlaps with the membership of the OU network, but is not a subset of it...</p>

<p>Another useful piece of intelligence about people on Facebook who have declared an OU allegiance are the members of the general OU social group. Membership of that group today stands at about 2000.</p>

<p>Even if each of these groups were totally distinct - that is, let's assume members of one are not a member of either of the others<br />
&nbsp;- this would give a population of less than 15,000 people who had declared an allegiance with the OU through one of the three biggest OU forums on Facebook. Course Profiles currently has almost 4,200 users.</p>

<p>The saturation level&nbsp; - that is, the maximum possible uptake - for an application such as Course Profiles is thus a relatively small number of users. For a particular instance of an application designed to support current members of a single institution, your user base is only likely to ever number in the thousands, with two exceptions:</p>

<p>1) an HEI may have a large number of alumni, maybe an order or magnitude larger than your current population; and</p>

<p>2) it may have a large potential audience base (though again, this is likely to max out at less than two orders of magnitude larger than the number of current students in your institution.</p>

<p>(There are exceptions - the Open University raises it's profile through BBC broadcasts, though even with audiences for some programmes numbering in the millions, this is still less than 2 orders of magnitude larger than our current student numbers (approx. 150,000 at the current time)).</p>

<p>The other way of growing Course Profiles numbers would be to offer it to other institutions, growing it in much the same way that Facebook originally took off. We keep talking on and off about how we might make Course Profiles available for use elsewhere, so if you're interested, please get in touch... Just bear one thing in mind - we don't really want to get involved in application support! <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/fb" rel="tag">fb</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20course%20profiles" rel="tag"> course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>One of my favourite TV series from several years ago is <em>Yes, Minister</em>, the story of hapless government minister (and later, Prime Minister) James Hacker MP. One of the tricks that SIr Humprey Appleby, his senior civil servant, would use to dissuade Hacker from pursuing a particular decision was to label is as <em>brave</em>, the implication being that it would get Hacker in to trouble, or lose him his seat...</p>

<p>Just yesterday, I got the following <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/03/planning-ahead/#comments">comment</a> over on a new blog I've started: "Good luck with this, I don’t think I would have the nerve to do something similar online."</p>

<p>Gulp...</p>

<p>The context is this: <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/">Digital Worlds - Interactive Media and Game Design</a>, "an experiment in the production and delivery of online educational materials…"</p>

<p>In short, I'm going to have a go at 'blogging a course', sort of... </p>

<p>The experiment started today - <em>ish</em> - and will hopefully carry on for at least the next 2-3 months. Feel free to tag along, and/or share the URL with anyone you think may be interested ;-) </p>

<p>PS the BBC have popped a few clips from Yes, Minister up on Youtube, though they arenlt available for download. There's even on about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=WW7mhtp5a5E">University funding</em>... ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>I haven't posted about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook app</a> (did you know it got a <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/12/not-edublog-award-winners.html">Downesy</a>? ;-), although <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=113">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://greenhughes.com/content/course-profiles-application-updated">Liam</a> have been posting updates, whilst <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2008/01/facebook---the.html">Martin</a> has been calling the demise of Facebook;-) </p>

<p>Anyway, Liam pushed a minor release to our 3,300 or so users last week, (with a major interface redesign on the way sometime soon, hopefully...?!;-)</p>

<p>The first thing to notice from this course profiles panel on Liam's homepage is that Course Profiles now lets users declare an OU qualification code. This was one of the most heavily requested features, so we are listening... :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212611727/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/2212611727_6298708885.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0023" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="226" width="403" /></a></p>

<p>You might also notice a further bit of personalisation on the Profile page display - the ability to set your own Course Profile banner message:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2212634489/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/2212634489_6bce839485.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0037" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="56" width="395" /></a></p>

<p>There's also been an addition to the course actions page for each course, in the form of course recommendations based on a "people who studied this course also studied..." principle:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2213434700/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2213434700_eb84e97258.jpg" alt="2008-01-23_0040" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="347" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I dabbled with a course recommendation code from the O'Reilly <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21"><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em></a> book before the Christmas break, which seemed to work okay, but I'm not sure what&nbsp; algorithm Liam is using. Now that the functionality is in place, we'll maybe start thinking about how to optimise the algorithm - if we can work out what behaviour we're trying to prompt... (Liam, I'm thinking we maybe need to add a tracking code on the recommendation URLs - e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">&amp;src=A103_ca_rec</span>, or similar?)</p>

<p> It's encouraging to see that users are starting to engage with the course comments wall, too. Looking at the comments for A103, it's interesting to see a range of contributions, from old alumni, recent alumni (2007 presentation) and student's on the course that starts presenting in a week or two.</p>

<p>From chatting to one or two student and AL users of Facebook, the creation of groups for students yet to start a course, and wanting to meet-up with others who are also about to start the same course, is desirable (for some students). So it'll be interesting to see if the Find a Study Buddy utility gets much use over the next week or two, with the start of many courses due at the beginning of February.</p>

<p>One thing I hope to do over the next day or two is produce a report of Course Profiles activity for the course team of one of the more popular (and active) courses declared within the app, using both Course Profiles data (e.g. as shown <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012240.html">here</a>) and Google Analytics data, which we've been collecting for a while, but have only recently started looking at in any detail.</p>

<p>As with looking at Course Analytics, identifying sensible goals is an issue, but for starters I'm going with the course actions page (shown above) as well as clicks through to the comment wall and find a study buddy.</p>

<p>The OU web stats people are tracking clicks through to Openlearn materials for us, too, so all in all, we should have enough data to tell an interesting tale or two - and hopefully pick up a few clues about how the app is being used, and how we might improve it :-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20profiles" rel="tag">course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>There were a couple of significant changes to the BBC website this week, (which also saw the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/">BBC archive trial</a>).</p>

<p>First up, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">BBC iPlayer</a> moved online. In its original release, the iPlayer offered a downloadable client and library application (Windows only, for DRM reasons), which could be used to download BBC programmes within 7 days of broadcast, and then allow users to start to watch the content within 30 days of download (having started to watch, the content would be deleted after seven days). As of last week, you can now watch content online, on any platform (except the Wii:-(, via a browser. If you have the latest Flash player installed, this includes on full screen view.</p>

<p>One thing that's nice about the new iPlayer service is that programmes are bookmarkable via a URL. So for example, here is a link to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b0084lg1.shtml">first episode of Fanny Hill</a>, which you may or may not consider to be work safe. FOr adult content such as this, there is a checkbox screen requiring you to state you are over 16, with additional Guidance/lock controls available. For something a little less risque, here's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008kj0y.shtml">Kenneth Brannagh on the Culture Show</a>. Once the seven day watch again period has expired, I'm not sure what happens. Maybe pay to play, in the long run?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2104/2114813491_9f089b8c57.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="315" width="500" /></p>

<p>A couple of other things to notice - the service is out "in beta", and it also offers a range of 'traditional' sharing options, with links to social bookmarking and recommendation sites, as well as a self-contained recommend/email to a friend option. I have one quibble with the "Link to This" URL, though - there's no easy/automagical way of highlighting it and copying it to the clipboard.</p>

<p>A second major beta release was of the new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/beta/">BBC Customisable homepage</a>. Inspired by the like of Netvibes and Google Personal Pages, the new BBC homepage lets you customise the BBC homepage to a limited extent, such as deciding what news feeds you'd like to appear (and where - there is a certain amount of drag and droppable goodness), local weather, BBC TV listings and so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2114836423_97e7dbb6d6.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="344" width="500" /></p>

<p>The third announcement that caught my eye - made possible by the iPlayer online release - was the inclusion of watch/listen again services in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">BBC Programmes</a> website.</p>

<p>Here's how it looks...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2182/2114850309_894861486c.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p>...and then click though...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2176/2114850593_aea2903cfb.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="422" width="500" /></p>

<p>Audio player/Listen again links are also provide for Radio programmes, although links to archived radio programmes (that go back years in some cases) don't seem to have appeared on the Programmes site yet...</p>

<p>It's probably worth making a quick comment here about BBC URL goodness. For example:<br />
<ul><li>BBC iPlayer page for Spooks series 6 episode 9: <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008flpc.shtm</em></li><li>BBC Programmes page for Spooks series 6 episode 9: <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008flpc</em></li></ul>Notice anything similar? (Boo!;-)</p>

<p>Making content like available in this way is a Good Thing, I think, though the requirement for a recent Flash Player means the iPlayer won't work (at least in full screen mode) on the Wii... :-( Not having such toys, I wonder how the iPod touch will cope? Given that access to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7045123.stm">BBC content can be had for free via The Cloud wifi network</a> (stations, airports, pubs and hotels across the UK and abroad...), I can maybe start to see possible uptake of anytime, anywhere TV ;-)</p>

<p>And finally, what of the dear old BBC/OU relationship? The OU enters into co-production deals with the BBC on quite a few high profile broadcast series (<a href="http://open2.net/nhs/oneyearon/index.html">Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS?</a>, for example), so will we be seeing the iPlayer embedded - with watch again content - on appropriate pages on the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> website (which is <a href="http://www.bbcwil.com/av_open2.htm">produced by the commercial <em>BBC Worldwide Interactive Learning</em> unit for the OU</a>).</p>

<p>If YouTube is anything to go by, maybe not... The BBC have put up content from several OU/BBC co-pro series onto YouTube (such as clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaPJw2O6cUg">James May's 20th Century</a>), but these are unembeddable and - as far as I know - haven't appeared on the <a href="http://www.open2.net/20thcentury/index.html">corresponding open2.net page</a>.</p>

<p>In an age where the big dot com announcements appear in association with third party partners (Google launching Open Social with several partners, for example), I continue to be amazed that the OU/BBC partnership doesn't appear to extend as far as increasing the surface of content on the web via sites that are built around particular series by production partners... ho hum....</p>

<!--
<p>A couple of 'institutional' people have picked up on the Venturebeat reported story that a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/12/03/facebook-education-app-gets-funding">Facebook education app gets funding</a> inside the OU and posts have also appeared about it <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/facebook_and_courses/">elsewhere</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Inigral, a company behind a Facebook application called Courses, has raised slightly more than half a million in a round led by The Founders Fund, according to VentureWire.</p>

<p>Courses lets you find others in your college classes, then share notes with them, start a forum discussion, do a video chat and more. You can also keep track of assignments, upload your own notes and manage your course activities.</blockquote><br />
You can see reports on some of these <a href="http://adonomics.com/display/2365273563+4472914735+2863988150">education apps on Facebook via Adonomics</a> (thanks to <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/">Stuart</a> for the original screenshot):</p>

<p><img style="width: 711px; height: 234px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2104663754_948d2fa391_o.png" /></p>

<p>The app mentioned in the Venturebeat story is <em>Courses</em>.</p>

<p>I posted a couple of chaser comments about the story, which I'll summarise them here 'for my own record':<br />
<blockquote>The avenue we're keen to explore [with Course Profiles] is the extent to which 'public' social networks can be used to provide additional forms of support for our home study students, who are spread across the UK (and indeed, across the world). [In this sense, Course Profiles is (currently) an instituion specific application.]</p>

<p>So as with the other apps, we support 'find a study buddy' functionality, 'friends on a course' and course comment walls.</p>

<p>We're also offering support in the app for people taking <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn open educational courses</a> so you can add an OpenLearn course unit to your profile if you want to. Again, the idea here is to help broker social networks amongst learners where physical colocation is all but ruled out, unlike the situation in trad universities where you sit in lectures with your peers.</p>

<p>One of the the things we are looking at with our app are ways of making it a little bit stickier. Just listing courses is something that will take you to the app once per course. Building some sort of weekly (or even daily) use case around the app is a whole other issue.</p>

<p>One thing we are wary of doing with the app is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011606.html%20">intruding on the student's social space</a>; so finding useful things for users to do in the app without making it seem like we are forcing VLE functionality into Facebook is one of the thing's we're thinking around...</p>

<p>At the moment, our daily users are running at about 5% on a userbase of 2,400. With approx 50 adds a day accounting for 2% of daily users, that means we have 2-3% daily active users. I don't know that really means though.</p>

<p>[So how much activity should we expect in the app, if we want to claim it is 'successful'?]</p>

<p>- Adding a course to the profile is something you do once.<br />
- Looking for a study buddy on a course maybe something you do a handful of times.<br />
- Commenting on a course maybe something you do regularly IF the comment wall takes on the role of an active FB group for a course, or if it takes over part of the role of the 'official' course (or alumni) conference.<br />
- Using the 'friends on a course' area as a place for communicating with friends (like a cut down address book) is something you might do regularly (err???? ;-)</p>

<p>The way we're thinking about the app in its current form, it's hard to see why daily use rates would be that high at all?</p>

<p>And bear in mind that if you max out on average at one or two weekly visits for the duration of the course, this would only give 1/7 = 14% daily active users...</p>

<p>So maybe 3% active for course profiles isn't that bad?</blockquote>Although Course Profiles was started as an unofficial, skunkworks app, and largely continues as such, the app has been mentioned in several official channels, with a news item on students' "Student Home" webpage, a mention on the Open University profile page on Facebook, and plugs in both Open House, the internal staff magazine, and Sesame, the student and alumni magazine (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/events/5/2007124_59055_o1.pdf">download avalailable</a>: "Show us your face!" p32).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/2105443610_8f3615e3f7_o.png" /></p>

<p>Finally, I picked up on another UK HEI use of Facebook from a sideways mention by IT Professional of the Year, <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/oclc-symposium-at-online-information-2007/">BriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIAN KELLY</a>): in particular, the "pilot [use of a] Facebook group for students on our [Oxford] short online courses" (Dave White, "<a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2007/11/28/reaching-into-the-web/">Reaching into the Web</a>").</p>

<p>There's quite a bit of <a href="http://isthmus.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/PersistentCommunityDiscuss">relevant discussion behind the decision to use a Facebook group</a> on their project wiki.</p>

<p>We've started discussing potential "issues" we might get into if we start recommending that students use Facebook groups, or the Course Profiles app course comments walls, in any sort of "official" way (direct, implied or otherwise), so it'll be interesting to see whether the Oxford discussions have mirrored our own...<br />

<p>Just over a year ago, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> released the lightweight <a href="http://msg.open.ac.uk">MSG Instant messenger app</a>, which I saw demoed in the context of a quick <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007760.html"><em>ad hoc</em> conference chat</a> solution.</p>

<p>Since then, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/developer/msg-map-widget/">Google presence maps</a>, and an <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/user-guide/msg-netvibes-widget/">MSG Netvibes widget</a> have appeared, and a link to the similarly lite <a href="http://www.mebeam.com/">Mebeam 1-click video chatroom</a> app added to the interface (<a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/2007/11/21/video-chat/">MSG Video Chat</a>).</p>

<p>And now, following the opening of an open OpenID  on the open.ac.uk domain (!) last week, Alex has just posted that <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/?p=288">MSG now accepts OpenID identities</a>, along with the claim that "MSG is the first instant messenger system to offer open registration and the ability to login with an OpenID identity".</p>

<p><img src="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/images/msg-openid.jpg" alt="MSG login page" /></p>

<p>If you want a no frills OpenID, you can grab one at <a href="http://openid.open.ac.uk/">http://openid.open.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't know what OpenID is all about, this may help - <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Vq0R1Y1A2rE">OpenID Show</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vq0R1Y1A2rE&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vq0R1Y1A2rE&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>If you want an MSG account (instant registration), you can get one at <a href="http://http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/launch/">http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/launch/</a></p>

<p>A good way to get an MSG account is to just log in straight away with an OpenID, and then an MSG account will be invisibly created for you.</p>

<p>And the next step...? Hmmm... it'd be really neat if <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> was to start accepting OpenIDs... ;-)</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/developer/">MSG is open source</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Hierarchical Course Clusters from Course Profiles App</h3>

A couple of weeks ago, I got hold of a copy of the O'Reilly book Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. For anyone wanting to get started with 'intelligent' techniques for clustering data, building simple recommendation systems and so on,...
<!--
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I got hold of a copy of the O'Reilly book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21">Programming Collective Intelligence</a> by <a href="http://kiwitobes.com/">Toby Segaran</a>. For anyone wanting to get started with 'intelligent' techniques for clustering data, building simple recommendation systems and so on, this book is joy to play with.</p>

<p>Filled with examples in Python (which is a language I've never really played with before... powerful, isn't it?! ;-) you can get 'sort of' working recommender systems up and running in minutes using only a few lines of code...</p>

<p>So - I had a bit of tinker last night with our original <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Facebook Course Profiles app</a> data set collected from 700 or so anonymised users (the same data set I used to generate the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">treemap displays</a>). The <span style="font-style: italic;">Collective Intelligence</span> book has an example of building a recommendation system based on delicious links that uses 'users' and 'urls' as the source data... so it was pretty trivial to recast the example to use 'users' and 'course codes' as the input data and build a proof of concept course recommendation system on that basis.</p>

<p>Liam has got another recommender system working in the dev version of the Facebook app already, so it'll be interesting to see if he used any of the heuristics I came up with for reducing the complete data set to a useful subset of data that was good for making recommendations (one strategy I used that looked okay at first glance was to rule out users who had declared less than five courses, and courses that occurred less than five times, from the recommender set).</p>

<p>The book also shows how Python can be used to generate simple visualisations of clustered data, for example. The first clustering algorithm explained in the book tries to cluster similar blogs based on the similarity of words used in them. Again, it was easy to map 'users' and 'course codes' on to 'urls' and 'words' features used in the example, and then reuse the reduced recommender data set (that is, the set based on users who had declared more than five courses which had also been declared more than five times), to see how courses were clustered by the Facebook app users .</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the Python JPG generating libraries working on my Mac yet (I'm not convinced everything is there...:-( but as the first data set I wanted to try to visualise was a hierarchical clustering, it struck me that I could use the <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind viewer</a> if I put the clustered hierarchy results into an appropriate XML form...</p>

<p>...so here's what the result looks like...</p>

<p><br />
<img style="width: 747px; height: 409px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2299/2083871776_4a907af087_o.png" /></p>

<p><br />
From the course codes, the clusters appear to be pretty sensible to me (bearing in mind the data set is quite small).</p>

<p>If you want to have play, here's the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseClustHierarchy.mm">Freemind file</a>.</p>

<p>Next coffee break, I'll have a go with the K-means clustering and maybe look at the data in a Many Eyes network diagram...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualisation" rel="tag">visualisation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/clustering" rel="tag">clustering</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/freemind" rel="tag">freemind</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Making Your PDFs Pay, (and PS Next Stop - Last.uni?)</h3>

I got really excited today by the widely reported news item that Yahoo and Adobe were teaming up to provide ads for PDF... I imagined containers within the PDF document that would be populated with Yahoo ads at download time,...
<!--
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2074620598/" title="pdfAds.png"></a>I got really excited today by the widely reported news item that Yahoo and Adobe were teaming up to provide <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/adsforpdf/">ads for PDF</a>...</p>

<p>I imagined containers within the PDF document that would be populated with Yahoo ads at download time, ad selection coming from both content analysis of the surrounding PDF text, and personalisation based on <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's ad platform</a> knowledge of the person downloading the document.</p>

<p>Just like widget containers on your site that allow third party sites to pipe their advertising to your page (giving you a percentage commission on any revenue they generate from that placement) I imagined the platform dynamically injecting ads directly into the PDF document, or at least, adding them into Adobe Acrobat/Reader views of the document.</p>

<p>But it's not like that at all :-(</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/2074620598_2492c1e76a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="281" width="500" /><br />
 <blockquote>When a recipient opens a PDF document from a commercial publisher participating in this program, ads will be dynamically matched and displayed in a panel adjacent to the content. The publishers are eligible to be paid for valid clicks on the ads. Adobe has partnered with Yahoo! to provide ads across a broad range of categories to match PDF content. Since the ads come from Yahoo!, publishers do not have to establish and maintain direct relationships with advertisers. </blockquote><br />
Never mind... the thought was amusing while it lasted ;-)</p>

<p>PS by the by, the 'container ad insert' model scales in all sorts of other directions too. I remember hearing a podcast some time ago (I can't find it now :-(, in which podcast pioneer Doug Kaye was taking about the production pipeline for <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> podcasts. Textual metadata was used to pull in audio production credits at the top and tail of a podcast, and there was also a mechanism (I guess?) for pipelining in audio ads. This was all done offline, I think, (although maybe the ad inserts were regenerated/updated every so often to keep them current?). If anyone knows of a white paper - or other write up - about the architecture of that platform, I'd appreciate a link...</p>

<p>PPS having mentioned IT Conversations, I guess I should also mention the <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/">Conversations Network</a>, "a listener-supported non-profit podcast network brought to you by a global team of passionate audio/video producers and editors." As well as <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> (where you can catch many of the talks presented at the various O'Reilly conferences as well as Jon Udell's <em>Interviews with Innovators</em>), they produce <a href="http://mc.conversationsnetwork.org/">Media Conversations</a> (which carries Future Talks, "an interview-style program with futurists Glen Hiemstra and Gerd Leonhard") as well as a couple of other channels...</p>

<p>What might be of even more interest to OUseful.info readers (or at least Martin, who dreams of <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/03/lastuni.html">Last.uni</a>) is the Conversations Network <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/tutorials/tutorial-queue/">CN Recommendation/Queue System</a>:<br />
<blockquote>personalized recommendations are based upon your ratings of other programs you have heard combined with how other members have rated the same and additional programs. If [a recommended program] is a program you'd like to hear, you can play it immediately, download it to your computer, or add it to your Personal Program Queue (PPQ) for later listening.</p>

<p>The contents of your PPQ can be delivered as a podcast. Think of your PPQ as a playlist over which you have complete control. You can add and remove programs from the playlist and change their order. And because it's a podcast, you can subscribe to it in the same way as you can subscribe to other podcasts. The only difference is that you have no control over what's in the feeds you get from most podcasters; you get what they want you to hear. But with The Conversations Network PPQ, you can subscribe to a podcast that contains precisely what you want to listen to.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, your PPQ podcast feed contains the programs in your queue. Every other member has their own PPQ podcast feeds containing the contents of their own queues. (Yes, you can share your feeds with others, even non-members. You control the playlist for your friends and family.)</blockquote><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/itconversations" rel="tag">itconversations</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pdf" rel="tag">pdf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ads" rel="tag">ads</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/last.uni" rel="tag">last.uni</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Facebook - What is it Good For? "Absolutely Nothing - Say it Again..."</h3>

<p>Alan writes, as Mr Angry, in a <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=96#comment-115">comment to a post</a>: "Facebook is another matter, but I can't see much educational value there anyway (beyond marketing) - for God's sake leave students some social spaces without trying to stalk them and shove learning down their throats!"</p>

<p>He also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/SOTI/%7E3/189469846/im-confused-about-coursefeed.html">picks up on</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5243732877">Coursefeed</a>, an app that displays your course feeds from the Blackboard VLE in Facebook.</p>

<p>From the Coursefeed app page:<br />
<blockquote>Browse your courses, post messages to the class, share notes - all without ever leaving Facebook. CourseFeed also alerts you when your professor posts announcements, tests, or content to your course. And you'll get alerts when classmates post to the course wall and share notes.</blockquote>There are several things going on here, I think. One relates to delivering information feeds and course news items raised in Blackboard to you in Facebook. This may or may not be useful. Another relates to sharing information between students on a course. Without exploring the app, I'm not sure whether this means discussing a course within the app itself or linking back to the VLE.</p>

<p>What the app does show (if it works as advertised) is how the back end of an institutional system may be integrated (to a limited extent) with a 'portable' widget/app front end in a space like Facebook. One question then is - can the information contained within Facebook - that is accessible to the app developer - be used to add value to the VLE-in-Facebook widget, in such a way that: a) doesn't upset the users; and b) fits in with the way users want  to use Facebook.</p>

<p>One of the key constraints we imposed on ourselves for the development of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Course Profiles Facebook App</a> (which allows you to add a list of courses you have taken to your profile, find other people who have taken the same course, and link through to OpenLearn content for that course, where it exists) was that we would not exploit any privileged access to OU backend systems. For example, we would not expose an information that could only be accessed via OU authentication. This was "enshrined' in our stated belief that anyone should be able to build the app...</p>

<p>The Coursefeed app has indeed been built "by anyone", but it requires that institutional credentials be submitted via the app to gain access to a particular VLE. I haven't chatted to Liam and Stuart about this, but my preference is that Course Profiles won't take that route either. I don't want to be in a position where Course Profiles is accessing information that isn't either: a) publicly available; or b) declared to the app by the user.<br />
   <br />
Another key tenet behind the development of our Course Profiles Facebook app was that it should leverage those portions of the social network graph that Facebook exposes to applications. For example, by seeing the public 'friends' network of an individual, we could add value to it by essentially creating personal 'course groupings' based around which of your friends is on the same course as you. By mining the Course Profiles data, the Facebook "social graph" can be enhanced by adding adding additional edges between people who have declared the same course, and so on. An exciting feature in development as more people add the app and declare courses is that we can now start to offer course recommendations along the lines of "users who declared this course also declared that one..."</p>

<p>A quick glance at the OU Network on Facebook shows many students have created groups for courses they are studying. Many of these groups only have a handful of members - who were potentially friends anyway? Or they may have been established by people looking for friends on a course.</p>

<p>What the formation of groups suggest to me is that some students want to create their own break out spaces where they can talk about a particular course outside of the university context (maybe because their VLE doesn't allow student created groups, maybe because they don't like the environment the institution offers, maybe because the setting is "too formal").</p>

<p>Within the Course Profiles app, we have enabled a comment/discussion area that provides a 'pre-created" space for people who have declared a course to talk about that course (or take anything, really - we don't moderate the spaces). In fact, you don't even have to declare the course to be able to comment about it (although you do need to have installed the app) - you can just hack the URL to get in (the comment areas are keyed by course code).</p>

<p>Declaring a course within Course Profiles this immediately provides you with access to two course groupings: a) your friends who have installed the app and declared the same courses as you; b) via "Find a Study Buddy", anyone who has installed the app and declared a particular course (subject to them setting appropriate privacy settings).</p>

<p>What I guess I'm trying to say is that tools like Course Profiles are not intended to 'push learning', but they are intended to support social learning activity, through supporting the discovery of like-minded people and facilitating discussion with them. For a distance learning institution like the OU, this social support can play an important role in addition to the 'official' support offered by the institution.</p>

<p>By making available links to OpenLearn material through the app, we allow users who might be considering taking a course to inspect some of the material released from it into OpenLearn - discussions with the OU library helpdesk suggested that course materials inspection prior to a course was a common request.</p>

<p>What is perhaps surprising is that in recent years, the OU hasn't been aggressively innovating in this area, compared to years past; (the OU has been running online conferences to support courses for years, for example...)</p>

<p>Some time ago, I came across <a href="http://www.corank.com">CoRank</a>, which is not a hosted Digg-clone, (but it is, really...;-). Over the last week or so, I've been using an RSS import facility (available on request from corank) to populate <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">http://openlearnigg.corank.com</a> with links to OpenLearn Units (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007457.html">Time for an OpenLearnigg (sic) Environment</a> for my earlier doodles on this topic).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2078/1710833805_60779ad082.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="319" width="500" /></p>

<p>CoRank supports topic based and tagged classification, so I've mirrored the OpenLearn topic structure, and also added a handful of tags to each post (by hand! Ideally, this would be done automatically using some sort of  term extraction or content analysis tool).</p>

<p>I've set the permissions up so that:<br />
<ol><li>anyone can vote;</li><br />
<li>registered users can comment;</li><br />
<li>only I can add tags (I think) and new links.</li></ol><br />
All the links point back to the corresponding unit on the OpenLearn site.</p>

<p>Having got access access to al the template files (again - <a href="http://corank.zoomblog.com/archive/2007/08/30/one-more-step-towards-complete-customi.html">available on request</a>).</p>

<p>On the to do list template hacking wise is the addition of feed URLs for each unit, and then maybe a Grazr embedded feed view of the content from each unit.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking of collecting links to the MIT opencourseware units, agian by piping them in via <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/rss/index.htm">MIT OCW course listings RSS</a>.</p>

<p>Last night, I came across a really simple recipe for <a href="http://gathadams.com/2007/06/18/how-to-write-a-facebook-application-in-10-minutes/">writing a facebook app in 10 minutes</a> last night, and was pleased to find it actually takes less than that, once you get your eye in.</p>

<p>The app builder is not really an app builder, as such, it's a recipe for embedding a webpage in an iframe with an applications "canvas" page on Facebook (<em>not</em> the actual profile page), very much in the style of <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringle</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, to get things started, here's an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=ec265cfb01504408c7b751bcb1098d3c">OpenLearn Course Units</a> facebook app. Add it to your Facebook profile and you can read the content of <em>every</em> <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> unit via the unit RSS feeds, which are bundled using my own <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010577.html">OpenLearn OPML bundles</a>.</p>

<p>Having cracked the recipe, it was easy enough to build some other apps:<br />

<h3 class="title">My RadiOBU Confusion...</h3>

Earlier today, I got tipped off to an Open2.net/OU programme listing feed (which I have vague memories of being told about, but don't recall having seen on the Open2.net site, where it should really be autodiscoverable on every page ;-)...
<!--
<p>Earlier today, I got tipped off to an <a href="http://open2.net/feeds/rss_schedule.xml">Open2.net/OU programme listing feed</a> (which I have vague memories of being told about, but don't recall having seen on the Open2.net site, where it should really be autodiscoverable on <em>every</em> page ;-)</p>

<p>What this means is I can now use something like <a href="http://30boxes.com">30 boxes</a> to get a calendar interface to the listings, and probably also generate an iCal feed easily enough (what would be handy would be to have the programme listing available in a Google calendar...).</p>

<p>(Just in passing, <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/06/30-boxes-and-the-facebook-revolution/">30Boxes calendars can be added to a Facebook profile...</a>.)</p>

<p>Digging around the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> site, I also found a handful of podcast feeds: for <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/podcasts.html">Ever Wondered About Food</a>, <a href="http://www.open2.net/thingsweforgot/podcast.html">The Things We Forgot To Remember</a>, <a href="http://www.open2.net/weekendbreak/index.html">Weekend Break</a> and <a href="http://www.open2.net/society/education/talking_languages_podcast/index.html">Talking Languages</a>, in fact.</p>

<p>It was trivial to add these to a Grazr reading list using the new <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010585.html">Grazr 2.0 drag'n'drop reading list interface</a>, along with a current podcast feed from the Material World website on the BBC Radio 4 website (Material World is another programme that the OBU (the Open Broadcasting Unit) have a hand in producing.</p>

<p>I also added an 'enriched' Click On bookmark feed using a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010401.html">feed enrichment pipe</a> that augments a delicious  RSS feed with media attachments, in this case a link to a <em>ram</em> (Real Audio) stream - many widgets (such as Grazr) will embed an appropriate player if they find a media enclosure in  a feed, so you can play it without having to leave the widget at all.</p>

<p>Stumbling across some Reith Lecture pages, I bookmarked the Real Audio feeds to delicious with some appropriate tags to seed a couple of Reith Lecture "channels" too.</p>

<p>(I need to do a new pipe that generates the <em>ram</em> enclosure URL automatically from a bookmarked webpage on the BBC website, <em>assuming</em> an appropriate URL mapping exists, of course!)</p>

<p>So here's a link to my <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0">RadiOBU Grazr Widget</a>:</p>

<div style="height: 350px; width: 300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/b74def0"></script></div>

<p>And here's where confusion sets it... How, why and if at all is this interesting? (I've doodled around this before, in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009962.html">What's on the Web RadiOU?</a>.)</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I put together an OU SplashCast player containing several OU related channels (I'll add some radio ones when I get a chance). And as I put together more OBU related programmes, I'll add them to that channel and this RadiOBU ("radio, boo") widget. But so what?</p>

<p>I'm starting to feel as if I've found lots of OU broadcast related jigsaw pieces (including some from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006117.html">BBC Programme Catalogue</a>), but I've no idea whether they can be put together in a compelling way?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, here are couple more bits of confetti that are muddling my thinking further, both from meetings today:<br />
<ul><li>an interest in our new department to produce regular "podcast" material for our department website. My impression was that this could be something like <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> rather than <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a>, a short form <a href="http://talk.talis.com/">Talking With Talis</a> rather than <a href="http://www.twit.tv/twit">TWiT</a>, but we'll have to wait and see...</li><li>"traditional production models rule, okay?" - a takeaway for me today from a course team meeting for a course that will start in 2010, is that we invest a <em>huge</em> amount of effort in course production, but very little in exploiting OBU productions, particularly radio. IMHO, the recent series of <a href="http://www.open2.net/clickon/index.html">Click On</a> could be used as the basis of an interesting magazine website, with content to wrap the "listen againable" programmes, and suitably selected and filtered news feeds providing fresh content to keep the pages up-to-date without human intervention. I started to explore this in the context of Click On series 1 some time ago: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On in Context</a>. Of course, OBU already do this to a certain extent (if you need a Netvibes tutorial, why not point pople to the <a href="http://www.open2.net/sciencetechnologynature/computing/web2workshop/personal_portals.html">Click On Web2.0 Workshop</a>, for example?) but we donlt exploit OBU material at a departmental publicity level.</li></ul></p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a> is putting out more and more content <em>all the time</em>, and yet I get the feeling we don't really have much idea about how we can <em>really</em> start to exploit its publicity-through-use value alongside the public service education payoff.</p>

<p>Maybe it will all become clear to me in the morning...</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: because it was so easy to do, I created a proof-of-concept <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5230153497">RadiOBU Facebook application</a> that allows you to listen to RadiOBU from a Facebook application canvas page.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/obu" rel="tag">obu</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20OU" rel="tag"> OU</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20broadcast" rel="tag"> broadcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Looking at the OU and OpenLearn presence on Youtube just now (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity">OU on YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openlearn">OpenLearn on YouTube</a>), it struck me that the days of stumbling across OU programmes in the early hours of the morning could well be here again...</p>

<p>I currently have a Mogulus channel streaming techie programmes 24 hours a day, including through my FaceBook page, and it would be easy enough to do the same thing fro OU related content.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here's an <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/full_screen/?channel_code=IDVR4004KO">OU Channel</a> via Splashcast.</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/p/SYBZ7327OU" wmode="transparent" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="300" width="400"><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="400"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=IDVR4004KO" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add OU Snippets to your page</font></a></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>It contains several shows - OpenLearn, OU, Open2.net, and some flotsam and jetsam from elsewhere on YouTube...<br />
 <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p></p>

<p>PS it's worth pointing out that the above channel only took a few moments to put together. Splashcast lets you cretae a show by subscribing to an RSS feed. The OU, Open2 and Openlearn shows were created in exactly that way- by entering the approriate YouTube username for each YouTube channel I wanted to subscribe to into the YouTube feed subscription slot on the definition page of each show...  <!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openlearn" rel="tag">openlearn</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/splashcast" rel="tag">splashcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Codes - A Web 2.OU Crown Jewel</h3>

<!--
<p>In the days when this blog was dominated by library related concerns, I used to spend a lot of time working out how to use ISBNs as <em>pivot points</em> for various book related searches; (librarians, of course, don't rate ISBNs - they'd rather focus on the city a book was printed in...).</p>

<p>At the time, I produced a simple script to generate URLs that accepted an ISBN key - Amazon look ups, for example, or book cover images - you can find a link to the page from here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006058.html">ISBN Playground</a>. (The list may be a little out-of-date/increasingly incomplete by now...)</p>

<p>Somewhen around that  time, (or perhaps even before, in the days before I blogged everything?) I also dabbled with a couple of webservices, in particular a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/bookSearch.php">course related book search</a> (as well as an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/courseSearch.php">alternative course search</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112706059878402306"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RvP7ErwKCQI/AAAAAAAAAtw/Q-BdqOzmHm8/s800/ousefulBookSearch.png" /></a></p>

<p>This service looked up the set books associated with a course (in fact, it looked up the books students had to <em>purchase</em> for the course) and provided links for them through to the OU Library, as well as on Amazon and elsewhere, and also provided a couple of links to related course pages.</p>

<p>The service is no longer maintained, so many of the courses listed may have ceased presentation by now (and many of the newer current courses won't be listed), but it was an interesting exercise and one I;d like to revisit one day; not least because I'd like to put together a full RESTful API for it (and maybe tidy up the current SOAP API).</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, as a precursor to that - possibly - I thought I'd start collecting URLs that are 'keyed' with an OU course code. This list is likely to grow over time (I'll try to maintain it), so if you're interested, it's probably worth bookmarking this page and revisiting it every so often...<br />

<p>It's worth noting, however, that the library database is sparsely populated and not all courses have items populating the above feeds.</p>

<p>Catching up on week or two old posts over a coffee just now, this one from the Nascent blog - <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2007/08/amazon_a_new_kind_of_publisher_1.html">Amazon: A New Kind of Publisher</a> - caught my eye with it's mention of Amazon's <a href="http://www.createspace.com/">CreateSpace</a> business.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.createspace.com/Special/AboutUs/PR/20070808_Books.jsp">original press release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>CreateSpace, part of the Amazon.com, Inc. group of companies (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the launch of a new online Books on Demand service. Also announced today, the company is no longer charging setup fees for books, audio CDs and DVDs. Authors, filmmakers and musicians can now offer their works to millions of customers on Amazon.com, CreateSpace.com and via their own free customizable eStore without any inventory, setup fees or minimum orders.<br />
...<br />
There are no setup fees or minimum orders for the CreateSpace on-demand service. Members are required to purchase and approve a proof copy of their book, CD, and/or DVD before titles can be produced on demand. Books published via the CreateSpace Books on Demand service are printed with high-quality, full-color paperback covers. Black-and-white or color interiors in multiple trim sizes can be selected as options. Members can also order high-quality copies of their book, DVD or CD at competitive wholesale prices.</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.createspace.com/BooksOnDemand">Books on Demand</a> service also offers 'publishers' the following as part of its listing service:</p>

<p><em>    *  Free ISBN will be assigned if you do not already have one<br />
    * Use Amazon's Search Inside!â„¢ feature for your book (what's this?)<br />
    * Amazon.com orders are eligible for Super Saver Shipping, One-day Shipping, and 1-Click ordering<br />
    * Your proof will normally ship within five business days after your order is placed</em></p>

<p>In many respects, as well as being an award/qualification granting body, the OU is - and always has been - an educational publishing house. The rise of online courses are opening up this side of educational activity to many other HEIs, too.</p>

<p>So here's a question to ponder - how might publishers of educational content/course materials leverage the sort of service Amazon's <em>CreateSpace</em> service can offer?</p>

<p>It's also worth bearing in mind that services like O'Reilly's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006669.html">SafariU</a> allow educators to compile their own POD (and ebook) textbooks from O'Reilly content, as well as mixing in their own content. (There's an interesting review of O'Reilly's methods and philsophy in a recent feature article at Information Today: <a href="http://www.infotoday.com/IT/sep07/Hawkins.shtml">O'Reilly Media: Spreading the Knowledge of Innovation</a>.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if SafariU "textbook mashups" qualify for an Amazon listing, but I'm guessing they will soon if they don't already...</p>

<p>I was just about to write a post talking up the release of RSS listings of OpenLearn courses, as well as the far, far more exciting news that RSS versions of the OpenLearn units themselves are being made available (e.g. see this list of <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/index.php">OpenLearn Units as RSS</a>), but you know what...? I'm not going to...</p>

<p>The value-add I had in mind for the post <em>was</em> intended to be a quick 10 minute script that took an RSS feed of course units, used a simple string rewrite of the URLs to convert them to URLs that pointed to the RSS feeds, and then bundled them up in an OPML file for viewing in Grazr.</p>

<p>But you know what?</p>

<p>Whilst the RSS listings of course units point - quite sensibly - to the "tidy" URL for each course (something like <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?name=A103_1">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?name=A103_1</a> for example), the unit content RSS feeds themselves (and the actual links to the course units on the HTML version of the page) use a nasty URL, such as <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1472">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1472</a> for a course unit, and <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1472/formats/A103_1_rss.xml">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1472/formats/A103_1_rss.xml</a> for a feed.</p>

<p>The number in the URL - <em>1472</em> in the above case - is of course unique to each unit, though it is consistent across HTML and RSS locations of the same unit.</p>

<p>And it doesn't appear anywhere in the "All OpenLearn Units", or OpenLearn Units by topic, RSS feeds.</p>

<p>So I <em>can't</em> use the RSS feed(s) of course units to produce an OPML feed that points to the RSS versions of the units...</p>

<p>That is, I can't even create the URL for the RSS version of a unit from the unit's description in the course listing feed...</p>

<p>So close, folks, yet so far away...</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE: there is- apparently - a sensible URL for the RSS feeds that works; for example <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/A103_1/formats/A103_1_rss.xml">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/A103_1/formats/A103_1_rss.xml</a> </p>

<p>Which means ...  I can get a feed of content feeds. For example, here are the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnopml.php">Science and Nature units via an OPML feed</a>. Note that at the moment, they don;lt seem to work in either Grazr or Optimal browser...]</strong></p>

<p>Putting together the previous post, I noticed that there is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/google"><em>Official GoogleChannel</em></a>, which has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhGpzyFdhE">product demos</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7s8q9nTQh4">'user' interviews</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLgJYBRzUXY">a bit of PR</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GtgSkmDnbQ">'inspirational' talks</a> and some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKAInP_tmHk">fun user-contributed stuff</a> too:</p>

<p>A quick scout around suggests that the OU might have just got one too: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity">http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105332915929746834"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RtnJPOIaDZI/AAAAAAAAAgg/Iqb1P6847VM/s800/ouYouTube.png" /></a></p>

<p><s>I guess Marketing have taken this one up, based on the first batch of content!</s> [UPDATE: SB writes: "What's all this about Marketing being responsible for the OU YouTube effort!!  It's the online services part of comms - Matt Rawlinson has been adding what he's allowed to. More to come soon..  Open2 are up there now too." I stand corrected...]</p>

<p>(Once the domain of the IT folks, I think that 'web stuff' is now increasingly owned by comms and marketing folks...)</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see what goes up there over the coming weeks and months. Ads and commercials, no doubt, although not quite the sort you might expect, as this quickie describing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01gX49ERzOE">some of the OU's boradcast TV output</a> suggests...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/01gX49ERzOE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/01gX49ERzOE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>So here are a few things I think we could start to pop up alongside the ads - note that this means using the channel as <em>more</em> than just a student recruitment channel... :</p>

<ul><li><em>software demos</em> - the OU is, among other things, an educational software house (though not as much as we used to be, I think...?) and the occasional walkthrough of some of our software tools would be both attractive to potential students, and possibly informative to the elearning community at large... (Software development is managed alongside other materials production by <em>Media Project Managers</em>, one of which is being <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3220&ref=ouseful">advertised at the moment</a>.) As well as educational software, we also develop research related software too, of course...</li>
<li><em>course adverts</em> - 2 minute trailers, with glimpses of the best bits, just like in movie trailers ;-)</li>
<li><em>talks and seminars</em> - from both internal and external speakers. I watch quite a few <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplex.html">Google Tech Talks</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theatre</a> presentations, so going for a wider audience for the <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">Berrill Stadium seminars</a> may be sensible?</li>
<li><em>student voices</em> - I seem to remember a <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/widening-participation/p2.shtml">Widening Participation DVD</a> being produced that could seed some of these clips?</li>
<li><em>clips of OU broadcast programming</em> - I notice that the BBC have a few OU clips on their YouTube site, but they aren't embeddable. It would be good if we could have them on the OU YouTube site though, and embeddable on <em>open.ac.uk</em> and <em>opent2.net</em> domains...</li></ul>

<p>Just by the by, there's a post up in the Open Broadcast Unit at the moment (the unit that manages OUr relationship with the BBC, among others...): <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3230&ref=ouseful"> Manager (Broadcast Project Impact), Open Broadcasting Unit (OBU)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>OBU is central to delivering the objectives of the OU partnership with the BBC. You'll be responsible for those aspects of the relationship with the BBC that relate to performance monitoring. This includes setting targets for, monitoring and reporting on the impact of TV and radio broadcasts, print support and online components.</p>

<p>You will work with OBU and BBC colleagues on particular projects and with a wider range of people in both organisations on strategy development and implementation. Excellent negotiating and communication skills are essential along with the ability to use your initiative to anticipate problems and provide solutions. You will have excellent IT skills and a good understanding of IT developments in the broadcast media, such as i-tunes, YouTube and web analytics. You will need an awareness of current broadcasting developments and factual programming both on TV and radio, and an interest in the aims of the partnership between the OU and the BBC.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, if you go for the post and get it, drop me a line when you arrive... ;-)</p>

<p>PS here's another, sort of related, catch-up item that really caught my eye: <a href="http://www.mcps-prs-alliance.co.uk/about_us/press/latestpressreleases/mcpsprsalliance/Pages/MCPS-PRSAllianceYouTubesignground-breakingagreement.aspx">Google's deal with the MCPS-PRS royalty collectors to license background music on YouTube movies</a>...</p>

<!--
<p>In my recent post on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010513.html">OpenMark Computer-Assisted Assessment Tool</a>, I described an open source electronic assessment system that has been developed - and is actually used - here at the OU to support our course assessment strategies.</p>

<p>As well as <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/">Open Mark</a>, the OU also hosts an <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/assessment/pages/tma-submission-methods.php">electronic assignment handling system</a> (the "eTMA system") that allows students to upload electronic copies of Office documents as submissions to an assignment and an eCMA system that provides computer based marking for multiple choice assessments (I haven't checked recently whether this is (still?!;-) based on students completing an OCR form that they have to post in to the OU, whence it is scanned in for electronic marking...)</p>

<p>One problem we have had until now is that as course team members we have been unable to see what our students see when using these assessment systems. For a start, we're staff, with staff authentication and corresponding staff access permissions. Added to which, we're not students registered on the courses we're actually running, so we don't have student permissions or access to the electronic assessment systems... After years of asking, it seems that this year the Technology Short Course Program course teams are going to get access to a dummy student account, which means that for the first time we'll be able to get a valid 'student experience' of our course materials - and hopefully the assessment systems too...</p>

<p>One issue that anecdotally keeps cropping up about the eTMA ad eCMA systems is that there is little feedback provided when you have uploaded an assignment  and it is often difficult to tell whether everything has worked okay (not being a registered student on any of our courses means I haven't been able to personally check this...).</p>

<p>This was brought home to me recently whilst marking a batch of scripts when I opened one script to find it was for the wrong course. (There were - and always are - several half-completed scripts too, and I'm never really sure whether these have been deliberately submitted as a final offering, or were an early, 'holding position' upload that hasn't been replaced by a later resubmission.)</p>

<p>What would be useful, I think, would be a 'preview' facility to show students what they have uploaded - something like the document viewer you find in <a href="http://scribd.com">Scribd</a>, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099430044050392706"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTQm2yUBoI/AAAAAAAAAeg/4tTxdEPfAt4/s800/scibd.png" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, this sort of facility would be useful all round, for markers as well as students.</p>

<p>Every time I mark scripts submitted via the eTMA system, I always get one that uses a 'different' document format. I don't remember what sort of submitted filetype it was this time round that I couldn't open on my desktop, but I do know I had to resort to viewing it in Google docs (which presumably breaks all sorts of OU rules?).</p>

<p>Added to the filetype problem (which really should be defended against - we specify the range of 'approved' document types in several places, so why doesn't the eTMA system check for these and warn the student that they have uploaded a file that their marker may not be able to open?) I occasionally wonder about virus issues - does the eTMA system automatically scan all uploaded files? And if so, what does it do if it finds an infection?</p>

<p>Using a system like the one adopted by Scribd, students would be able to check that they had uploaded what they intended to submit for an assignment, and markers could either view the file online, or download it using one of the (common!) supported formats. A commenting system could also be used to allow markers to comment back on the assignment to the learner.</p>

<p>The viewing technology could also be reused in our online course materials, as well as in student portfolios (speaking of which, Guy Carberry is soliciting comments on the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/?p=192">latest design iteration for MyStuff</a>...).</p>

<p><small>PS That's definitely it for a week or two, now... Let the holiday commence :-)</small></p>

<p>Some time ago, I posted about an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010382.html">Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</a> that crudely demonstrated how Pageflakes might be used as glanceable institutional news display.</p>

<p>It was quite gratifying to find out a couple of weeks ago that someone else here has had a go at producing their own dashboard - Jed Cawthorne's <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ecm">ECM Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099414088246888018"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTCGGyUBlI/AAAAAAAAAdY/t4tNOuiqH-M/s800/pageflakesJedECM1.png" /></a></p>

<p>The 'topic tabs' all employ the same layout - an informative, explanatory sidebar and two columns containing feed panels from several relevant blogs:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099414109721724514"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTCHWyUBmI/AAAAAAAAAdg/TafF6SHzUzA/s800/pageflakesJedECM2.png" /></a><br />
<small>[Oops - "thats" a typo ;-) ]</small></p>

<p>There's a lot going on ECMwise in the OU at the moment, so it's interesting to see OUr developments in the context of the wider world, as illustrated by the ECM dashboard.</p>

<p><br />
PS While on the topic of webtops, I'm not sure that I ever posted about the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/?p=103">launch of the OpenLearn Netvibes Universe</a>? </p>

<p>You can find it here: <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/openlearn">http://www.netvibes.com/openlearn</a></p>

<p>There are tabs for each of the OpenLearn topic areas, containing listings of all the units associated with a topic as well as sample materials for some of the areas. OpenLearn will be opening up a whole range of RSS feeds in the Autumn, so it'll be interesting to see whether or not OpenLearn feeds start appearing on independently produced webtops...</p>

<p>PPS <a href="http://www.open2.net/clickon/index.html">Click On</a> returns to Radio 4 in September, although it's moving away from Wednesday night broadcast to a Monday afternoon slot... "Webtops" are going to feature in the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> support offering for the programme, so stay tuned to find out more...</p>

<p>(All six programmes from the first series of Click On are available as listen again Real Audio streams (Real Audio player required). To hear these programmes again, check out this demo <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&amp;s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&amp;o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On Stringle page</a>.)</p>

<p>Earlier today, I had to combine a couple of abstracts I'd put in to the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007">OpenLearn Conference</a> for the single speaking slot I've been allocated. Although I normally keep everything, I couldn't track down either of the abstracts for quite some time, so I mailed the organisers to see if they could let me have copies back (unfortunately, the abstracts weren't on the conference website - I checked; and come to that, the same is true for the abstract of the presentation I'm giving at <a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/">Internet Librarian International 2007</a>, which I also appear to have, err, misplaced...!)</p>

<p>Anyway, assuming that I'm likely to have trouble tracking the new abstract down when I come to prepare my presentation in the <s>hours</s>, err, <em>days</em> (okay, Patrick? ;-) before the OpenLearn conference (30-31 October 2007), here it is... just in case...<br />
<hr><br />
<strong>Feeding from Open Courseware - Exploring the Potential of Open Educational Content Delivery Using RSS Feeds.</strong><br />
Tony Hirst<br />
Faculty of Technology, The Open University</p>

<blockquote>Abstract
An implicit aim of many opencourseware projects, including OpenLearn, is to encourage the informal use of open educational resources, as well as its reuse. In this presentation, I shall describe several examples of how open courseware can be disaggregated into component parts that can be easily shared and republished using RSS and OPML web feeds.

<p>From 'daily learning chunks' delivered to candidate PLEs such as PageFlakes using a Web 2.0 mashup to mobile access, this approach can also be used to turn bibliographies into online bookstores and provide a way of displaying media assets in a rich media slideshow.</blockquote><br />
The original wave of opencourseware initiatives, such as MIT's OpenCourseware project, sought to make high quality educational resources available for reuse and repurposing by whosoever wanted to avail themselves of that content. More recent thinking implies that just providing the content is not enough. Approaches such as OpenLearn provide a learning environment around the content that can provide personal learning support tools and support the formation of learning communities and.</p>

<p>Although providing 'reuse and remix' opportunities forms part of the war cry for the OER community, few demonstrations of just how the content may be used in such a way are offered. In the same way that the learning object economy that was much heralded by educational technologists never seemed to be as successful as was originally hoped, is it possible that the hoped for reuse and remix of OERs will similarly fail to take off (Lamb, 2007)?<br />
 <br />
The granularity at which open courseware content is typically published - the course, or course unit - makes it difficult to consume bite size chunks of content easily, and arguably makes it difficult to discover reusable or remixable items of content.</p>

<p>As I have written elsewhere, '[t]he easiest remix is not really a remix at all, and barely counts as a reuse, though it is a republish or represent - just take a direct copy of someone else's content and make it your own property/publish it on your own site, in your own content area' (Hirst, 2007).</p>

<p>At the simplest level, exposing open educational content via an RSS feed immediately opens up this republishing opportunity.</p>

<p>Taking a lead from social websites such as youTube and flickr, where content can be shared at a fine level of granularity (the movie or picture level) as well as at an aggregated level (a playlist or photostream), I shall describe several implemented examples of how both MIT Open CourseWare courses, and Open University OpenLearn units, can be disaggregated into component parts and then republished in a syndicated way using OPML and RSS feeds, as well as through social networks.</p>

<p>One advantage of making content available via RSS is the wide variety of pre-existing tools that are capable of consuming RSS feeds. For example, it is possible to consume RSS feeds RSS readers (e.g. Bloglines or Google Reader) or webtops (e.g. Netvibes, iGoogle or PageFlakes), as well as republishing content in RSS format as PDF documents, or even audio files. Mobile support for RSS feeds is also widespread.</p>

<p>However, the use of RSS feeds as a significant route for publishing OER content does not seem to be widely recognised. For example, the Open Educational Practices and Resources. OLCOS Roadmap 2012 (Geser, 2007) uses its section entitled 'RSS feeds enrich educational portals and learners can subscribe directly to thematic content feeds' to refer more to the way learners can aggregate content around a particular topic from formal and informal publishers, such as news services and bloggers, without suggesting that OER providers themselves might publish educational content in this way. This in part reflects the mindset that RSS is used to publish changeable content or content that is regularly updated, as opposed to providing a way to syndicate fixed or static content, such as unchanging course material.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I will describe the process by which early demonstration RSS feeds for OpenLearn content were generated from the original OpenLearn XML content and MIT OCW web pages using various third party online tools. Essentially, this is just republishing the materials in the RSS medium, in addition to the HTML pages or printable PDF documents that are typically made available.</p>

<p>This "RSSified" content can be used as the basis for republishing and remixing the content by third party users, or consuming it in the location of their choice. For example, RSS versions of course units can be viewed using candidate personal learning environment "webtops" such as Netvibes and PageFlakes, or distributed as "daily learning chunks" using OpenLearn_daily, a Web 2.0 mashup involving OpenLearn and Yahoo Pipes; and simple content remixes can be derived using RSS feed filters and simple content analysis tools.</p>

<p>Reusing or repurposing material at the level of granularity with which it is published (that is, at the course or unit level) is problematic on several counts: the physical format of the materials may not be appropriate, the way multiple topics covered by the materials are bundled together may not deliver the correct storyline for the person wishing to reuse (elements of) the course, the materials may not have the correct blend of media assets for the intended reuse, and so on.</p>

<p>By disaggregating content and individual assets and republishing them as separate items in a single RSS feed, the component parts of a course can be made available as a cleanly packaged bundle of separate items without the need for heavyweight packaging formats.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, I will show how an MIT OCW course can be atomised in such a way that bibliographic information and media assets related to course examples can be republished via shareable, rich media feeds, and how the course as a whole can be disaggregated into component parts that can then be republished in aggregated form using an OPML feed.<br />
 <br />
I will also describe an automated process for treating an OpenLearn course unit in XML form as a database that can be "mined" - or "asset stripped" - in several different ways to expose particular components of the course, such as link collections or image collections. The link collections can then be used to seed custom search engines, and media assets can be passed into course related photostreams or online radio channels.</p>

PS Not having any 'proper' references to hand (as requested by several referees of the original abstracts who didn't hint at what those references might be, or even where they might come from), I put out a shout to a couple of people who work in the area to see if they had any good ones to hand. Apparently not... Now I used to be a real academic reference junky (honestly!) back in my PhD days, although even then I'd be as likely to cite a pre-print or technical report I'd found on an individual's web page as something from a heavyweight (= slow turnaround) journal. But now? I am soooooooooo out of the formal literature and don't even know what conferences or workshop series to follow, let alone what journals to read ... So if you do know offhand of any good references that might bolster the above, can you, err, please mail me link or DOI? Or share me the link via delicious? Ta muchly... (I'll give you an acknowledgment, of course :-)</p>

<p>One of the key differentiators of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>, compared to other OER sites, is the provision of a "learning environment" around the open educational content. Several tools are provided to help learners make sense of the materials and also support community formation and social interactions.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/index.html">Compendium</a> visual thinking, knowledge mapping, sense making tool (which just doesn't make sense to me! Maybe I'm prejudiced against it because it requires a download...?;-):</p>

<p><img alt="compendium screenshot" src="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/osc/img/compendium/compendium_welcome.PNG" /></p>

<p><a href="http://flashmeeting.com">Flashmeeting</a>, a small group video conferencing tool, with and IM/chat line, whiteboard and the ability to record meetings and analyse participation within them:</p>

<p><img src="http://flashmeeting.open.ac.uk/images/screen01.jpg" alt="flashmeeting screenshot" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/">MSG Instant Messenger</a>*, with it's nifty geo-presence indicator (I don't think you can make chat histories public, though, in a "previous chats about this topic" sort of way?):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093658355355428050"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RrBPSW4pJNI/AAAAAAAAARI/Yw_jP6l5enA/s800/kmiMSG.png" /></a><br />
<small>(MSG is an open source software app, I think, that runs using Jabber?)</small></p>

<p> and the OpenLearn forums...</p>

<p>...which <a href="http://openlearn.blogspot.com/2007/06/forum-discussion.html">don't seem to be working at all well...</a>:<br />
<blockquote>We are having a problem in that the number of people who are using the OpenLearn forums and making postings is rather limited. It is felt that the reasons for this may be:</p>

<p>    * there are too many forums <small>[OUseful: YES - and this potentially silos discussions. For example, several units cover overlapping areas (climate change and global warming come to mind, elements of ICT systems do too). One thing discussion is good for is considering multiple points of view; the current forum structure fragments discussion even about the same topic.]</small></p>

<p>    * the forums are often too deeply embedded <small>[OUseful: YES - and where they appear moves around: on the front page, there's a link in the left sidebar, on the unit pages it's in the right; I guess the forum box is always below the scroll, though, which is some sort of consistency!]</small></p>

<p>    * people may not be encouraged to enter the forum <small>[OUseful: YES - but what do you expect? No-one likes to be first to post - many sites seed their forums to give the appearance of activity, like seating diners in the window of a restaurant...]</small></blockquote></p>

<p>And of course, it'd take at least 3 clicks? maybe 4? from the front page before you can even see evidence of a forum posting?</p>

<p>What brought OpenLearn comms to mind was a recent TechCrunch post on <a href="http://www.tangler.com/">Tangler</a> (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/31/tanglers-embedded-discussions/">Tangler's Embedded Discussions</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Australian startup Tangler has created a next generation forum product that allows real-time discussions to occur without page refreshes. Their forum product is both synchronous and asynchronous - meaning it competes as much with Meebo (web based chat) as it does with existing forum applications.</blockquote></p>

<p>Whether or not this is what Tangler does, reconciling "public" chat (i.e. supporting chat rooms as well as p2p chat), "public" Flashmeetings and forum discussions maybe one way of fostering and cross-promoting the OpenLearn communications channels?</p>

<p>At the moment, I'd have to look in several places for discussion about an OpenLearn topic (<em>if</em> such a discussion exists...): the Compendium archive, the Flashmeeting archive and the forums. And maybe a Facebook group.... etc etc.</p>

<p>Maybe finding a way of using forums as a conversation aggregator about a particular topic would be a better way to go?</p>

<h3 class="title">More OU Courses and Qualifications  Visualisations - Treemap Views</h3>

<!--
<p>In a previous post (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010472.html">Visualising OU Courses and Qualifications</a>), I showed how IBM's <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">Many Eyes data visualisation service</a> could be used to visualise OU course data, in particular the network of relationships between courses of qualifications.</p>

<p>There's a meeting at the OU on Monday where one of the agenda items is to look at a "single" curriculum for our ICT and Computing offerings, so I added a few more qualifications to the data list in case anyone wanted to make use of the visualisation to aid the meeting. (I didn't add all the Computing degrees - they seem to have down down the line of spawning "Computing with X" courses which will just clutter the diagram. I leave the visualisation of those qualifications as an exercise for members of the Computing department ;-)</p>

<p>The new data set can be found here : <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/data/SWUK0IsOtha6i2Ubhv21I2-">OU ICT C&Q data</a>. Note that is is not authoritative and study choices should not be based on it...</p>

<p>Here are a couple of visualisations based on the data:</p>

<p>- <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/SWUK0IsOtha6m2kbpI31I2-">Network visualisation</a><br />
- <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/SWUK0IsOtha6x2U5g_41I2-">Treemap visualisation</a></p>

<p>The network map is a little bit more useful with the additional data - node size now starts to reflects the degree of connectivity of elements:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199385029747602"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgXG4pI5I/AAAAAAAAAL0/Qf6DQbZ5Crg/s800/manyeyesNetwork.png" /></a><br />
<a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/SWUK0IsOtha6m2kbpI31I2-">Network visualisation</a></p>

<p>It would be handy to be able to associate an additional text column with entries in each data column containing tooltip text for each item (even better if the text data could be pulled in from another, separate table; I've just got a <a href="http://www.freebase.com">freebase</a> account and my first impression is that it's going to be like <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">dabble db</a> on steroids when it comes to cross-referencing and pivoting about data).</p>

<p>The Many Eyes treemap visualisation go the C&Q data is also starting to demonstrate it's power a little more obviously now, as the size of the data set increases: <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/SWUK0IsOtha6x2U5g_41I2-">Treemap visualisation</a>.</p>

<p>For example, here is a view of courses associated with qualifications, ordered by qualification:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199380734780290"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgW24pI4I/AAAAAAAAALs/dVKEFywquQM/s800/manyeyesTreemapQuals.png" /></a></p>

<p>This display makes it easy to see what courses are associated with any particular qualification.</p>

<p>It's also trivial to reorder the treemap to view of the qualifications associated with a particular course:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199359259943778"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgVm4pI2I/AAAAAAAAALc/a9iGZjpZEp4/s800/manyeyesTreemapCourses.png" border='0' /></a></p>

<p>This view of the data makes it obvious which courses are key to a large number of programmes  - and hence might also help identify ways of reducing the number of overlapping qualification offerings. </p>

<p>To swap between the two views, just drag and rearrange the data labels in the bar at the top of the screen:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092201120196535202"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/Rqsh8G4pI6I/AAAAAAAAAMA/0PjHIuNlogg/s800/manyeyesTreemapreorder.png" border='0' /></a></p>

<p>When in a particular view, the search tool allows you to see the distribution of child elements across the parent elements. So for example, in the qualifications view, we can search on a course code to identify which qualifications admit that course as an option:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199367849878386"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgWG4pI3I/AAAAAAAAALk/VqbSzTlUDu0/s800/manyeyesTreemapSearch.png" /></a></p>

<p>This search highlighting essentially adds another dimension to the visualisation, and one that I think may be useful in a visual course catalogue browser.</p>

<p>It would be even more powerful if it allowed Boolean search terms (<em>this</em> OR <em>that</em>).</p>

<p>Speaking of which - getting authoritative data about our courses and quals is decidedly non-trivial. It seems that different units within the OU have "ownership" over different parts of the data, with the result that people are unwilling to share their data. I also suspect that there are multiple copies of various bits of data (nominally the same) which are separately maintained.... Oops...</p>

<p>There is (at least one!) <a href="http://www.elframework.org/projects/xcri">XCRI</a> project underway at the OU, so it would be nice to think it can help establish an authoritative (and public!) view over the course catalogue for people to innovate with.</p>

<p>To drive innovation, I guess we'd really need to set up an affiliate scheme, too, so that anyone building a course choice catalogue on top of our data can get a referral fee if a student uses it to register on a course. (Maybe the referral fee would be held in escrow until the student completed the course...?)</p>

<h3 class="title">Online Course Analytics</h3>

<!--
<p>For some time, I've been running <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> on the <a href="http://ouseful.info"">OUseful.info blog</a>, and - err - somewhere else I'll post about another day.</p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to do is get access to OU search analytics, both internal and relating to search engine referrals, to see whether we can gain any useful curriculum development intelligence from the data: seeing what keywords students use to find courses, for example, or whether there are any frequent searches we can't accommodate.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of planning a course on gaming and interactive media design, for example, so it'd be handy to see whether anyone is searching the OU courses site with terms relevant to such a course, whatever they may be. (I've posted kite flying thoughts elsewhere about how we might be able to use search as a predictive tool: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">Search Powered Predictions</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009937.html">Click Powered Predictions...?</a>).</p>

<p>Analytics can be used elsewhere in the system, of course - I'm personally not that interested (at the moment...!) in "<a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm07/erm0742.asp">academic analytics</a>", using data about student behaviour to predict success in a course, identify students who may be struggling/about to drop out, and so on, though I do know that there are various people around the OU who have started taking an interest in such things. After all, when students drop out, we don't get any funding for them...</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> of interest to me, though, are analytics that describe how students may be interacting with our online course materials (this data of course is likely to feed in to "academic analytics", particularly with respect to identifying struggling or disengaged students, for example).</p>

<p>I hope to be able to post something a little more concrete about this over the summer, but for now I'm pondering the question of <em>what</em> sorts of data we want to collect.</p>

<p>After all, web analytics of the Google kind seem to be best suited to tracking user behaviour on sites with clearly defined goals, such as successfully completed shopping transactions.</p>

<p>For online course materials - like the Relevant Knowledge short courses - where 10 weeks worth of material are online, organised as weekly topics - identifying relevant goals and sensible "questions" we might ask of the analytics data (with a view to optimising/improving our course materials) is something we haven't really addressed.</p>

<p>So  - what should we track? Or indeed, to try and simplify the problem, what <em>might</em> we track.</p>

<p>The Relevant Knowledge courses all tend to have a similar structure (although each course does tend to introduce it's own innovations). A course calendar lays out the content for each study week, as does an index of the course materials. Links to online course forums are provided at the top level of navigation. Courses may or may not have a glossary and/or a resource page that contains links to external resources referenced in the course materials. A search box that allows users to search the web based course materials (but not external sites, our downloadable course content (I think...) is provided on each page, along with the option to print the page on the course content pages.</p>

<p>(Searching over content linked to from the course materials is easily achieved using a bounded/custom search engine. For example, see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">OpenLearn Unit Search Hub</a> which describes an automated route for creating a bounded search engine over domains linked to from an OpenLearn Unit.) </p>

<p>The course content itself is chunked into 10 to 20 HTML pages per week. Links are often provided to external websites. Links to downloadable documents (such as PDF files, movie or audio files) may be provided. The use of embedded audio/visual material (along with download links, as well as transcripts) is increasingly likely. Course materials include self-assessment exercises as well as narrative content. So-called SAQs (formative <em>self-assessment questions</em>) comprise of a question along with sample answer text. The answer text is revealed by clicking a form button or link (i.e. a trackable action is taken to reveal the answer). Online summative assessment materials are also provided - a CMA (computer marked assignment) around week 5, and an ECA (end of course assessment) in week 10. All assessment materials are "seen" from the start of the course.</p>

<p>So  - what to track?</p>

<p>Here are some preliminary thoughts:<br />
<ul><li>number of unique visitors (are all students logging in? from how many different browsers?);</li><br />
<li>number of visits per week (how often are students logging in, and when? Is there periodicity in access behaviour, aggregated over the cohort?);</li><br />
<li>average time per visit (what's a sensible chunk size in terms of study time?);</li><br />
<li>average number of page views per visit (again, useful intelligence relating to chunk size of teaching content);</li><br />
<li>bounce rate (but why are students bouncing? Using the course pages for navigation/to go elsewhere? If so - where?);</li><br />
<li>External links followed (are students following links at all? should we be providing other access points to external links, offering link collections by other means, such as feeding live bookmarks?);</li><br />
<li>Pages printed (are students printing out the course content, or consuming it online?)</li><br />
<li>Clicking through to course forums (looking at forum stats would also be useful, e.g. what percentage of students look at what percentage of messages?)</li><br />
<li>click-thrus to SAQ answers - and time spent looking at SAQ answer pages;</li><br />
<li>visitor behaviour around assessment pages (how often/how many times do students visit assessment pages? when? for how long? in the context of visiting other pages (possibly via search results) etc.);</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>Identifying sensible <em>goals</em> (which, if tracked, enables additional analytics, such as reverse path tracking (what links did a user follow to reach the goal).</p>

<p>Of course, making sense of course analytics is not just a question of collecting the data, but also interpreting it appropriately and not being misled by naive readings of it...</p>

<p>If you have thoughts about what else we could sensibly track, please post a comment or drop me a line. References to anyone else exploring this area would also be much appreciated...</p>

<p>PS one question I meant to pop down: <em>if we were optimising online course content pages, what would we be optimising them for?</em></p>

<p>I don't think we formally have one... maybe we should?</p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=11429">Philosophy Podcast storms the download charts</a><br />
<blockquote>What do Chris Evans, Danny Baker, Clive James and The Prime Minister have in common?<br />
All have podcasts in the Top 20 downloads on Itunes but none is as popular as senior OU Philosophy Lecturer, Dr Nigel Warburton, reading from his book Philosophy: The Classics.<br />
Dr Warburton's readings are currently 14th in the Top 20 and have more downloads than The Best Bits of Chris Evans; Danny Baker's All Day Breakfast Show and even, Prime Minister's Questions!<br />
<a href="http://www.learnoutloud.com/Podcast-Directory/Philosophy/Ancient-and-Medieval-Philosophy/Philosophy-The-Classics-Podcast/23666">Philosophy: The Classics</a> [<a href="http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss">RSS</a>] is an introduction to 27 key works in the history of Philosophy beginning with Plato and Aristotle and including the work of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Locke.</p>

<p>The free downloads began in May and will continue until all 27 parts are available. ...</blockquote></p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&view=o&file=http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;view=o&amp;file=http://www.philclassics.libsyn.com/rss"></script></div>

<p>I was also tipped off today about a talk about iTunes U that happened on campus that I couldn't make:<br />
<blockquote>One of the big questions the talk answered for many Open University staff is who has control of the content? It turns out that iTunes U is not a hosting service, it's a subscription model, i.e. it provides the RSS feed for your podcasts and acts as an advert for your university. This means that universities host their own content, and retain control of it - iTunes just provides a way for people to find and access it.</blockquote></p>

<p>Looks interesting - and maybe something we can get involved with?</p>

<p>The talk actually took place in KMi, a venue that often records seminars that take place there. For a full listing of their public seminars, check out <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/seminars/index.cfm">KMi Seminar Replays</a>.</p>

<p>PS It's probably also worth posting this link here (that should also have appeared in the OUseful.info feed via my delicious <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">feedthru</a> tag a few days ago): <a href="http://connect.educause.edu/blog/jklittle/podcastingateachingw/44653?time=1183709833">Podcasting: A Teaching with Technology White Paper | EDUCAUSE CONNECT</a>: <em>"exploration of educational podcasting in three realms: creation and distribution of lecture archives for review delivery of supplemental educational materials and content, assignments requiring students to produce and submit their own podcasts."</em></p>

<!--
<p>Inspired in part by my post last night on the current <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010471.html">OU Intranet Redesign</a> project, I spent twenty minutes or so (no longer - I assure you...[this post took longer to write!]) cutting and pasting a tiny amount of information from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/classifications/information_technology_and_computing.shtm">Information technology and computing qualifications</a> page into a Google spreadsheet:</p>

<table><tr><th>Qualification</th><th>Course</th></tr>
<tr><td>C50</td><td>M150</td></tr>
<tr><td>C50</td><td>MU120</td></tr>
<tr><td>C50</td><td>MST121</td></tr>
<tr><td>C47</td><td>M150</td></tr>
<tr><td>C47</td><td>T175</td></tr>
<tr><td>C39</td><td>TT280</td></tr>
</table>
...and so on...

<p>It was then an easy matter to cut and paste the data into <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/data/S8_UXHsOtha6u6-0_nRZH2-">Many Eyes</a> and then visualise it as a <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/S8_UXHsOtha6y6EKTuRZH2-">ICT Courses and Quals (sample) network diagram</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5083710105023523202"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/Roz3Z-b9qYI/AAAAAAAAAH4/oMVCPYzseLE/s800/cqNetViz.png" /></a></p>

<p>There are lots of things wrong about this visualisation (not least the typo of qualification GO4!), such as the fact that excluded course combinations are not identified in anyway, but for 20 minutes work the payoff is pretty good, I think?</p>

<p>For example, already it's possible to identify some of the qualifications a course may be associated with, or the breadth of courses that may be taken as part of a particular qualification.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how well this will scale, but the Many Eyes tool does let you move nodes around, zoom in on - and pan across - particular areas of the map, search over labels etc. </p>

<p>In fact, the search is a live search that will highlight labels as you type - so you can just look at level 2 Technology Faculty courses, for example (search on <em>T2</em>) and they will all be highlighted on the map) and then tunnel down to a particular course code to locate it - and the linked qualifications it can used for.</p>

<p>I need to explore Many Eyes in more detail, I think, to see what sorts of mapping are supported (it would be handy, for example, to be able to pop up a course or qualification name when you hover over its code), but I have no more time to spend on this today... :-(</p>

<p>The latest <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/communications/pics/d79841.doc ">OU internal communications brief</a> announces that <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk">OU Intranet</a> is up for a redesign apparently, and of course, of course, user opinions will be solicited... <br />
<blockquote><strong>INTRANET REDEVELOPMENT</strong><br />
The redevelopment of the University's Intranet is now well under way. Its purpose is to create a new working environment for all staff that makes access to information and the completion of daily tasks simpler. An Intranet audit of over 200 Intranet sites to determine their purpose, software used and plans for redevelopment is under way. An Interim Search Improvement Project is currently identifying search difficulties to determine how to improve results. The project is reviewing the most used search terms to see how successfully appropriate information was found and where necessary making them more accessible via Intranet navigation. Staff across the University will be interviewed in order to capture user requirements for future development. The volume of Intranet site traffic is being investigated to determine the most popular sites so that Information Architecture / navigation can be optimised. An 'Interim publishing strategy' recommends the tools to support any internal web site redevelopment/creation ahead of the full findings of the project.</blockquote><br />
So after a period of <em>no thought</em> whatsoever, here are a few of my own random thoughts, off the top of my head, in stream of consciousness style, scribbled down on the boat home (across the Solent), of some of the things I'd like to see...<br />
<ul><li><em>an infrastructure that accommodates publishing via RSS</em>, (which of course <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">we ignore at our peril</a>;-) To look at it now, the OU intranet home page could almost be completely replaced by a startpage/webtop powered by internal web feeds (a bit like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010382.html">OUseful dashboard</a>);</li><br />
<li><em>a search engine that works, usably</em>;  for the sake of a few of thousand quid, it'd be worth giving a Google appliance free reign to index the intranet for a week or two of side by side user trials with the current search engine; even if the Google box does a miserable job, observing the differences in both user experience and the quality of search results will provide an interesting lesson for anyone interested in how search works and is used in the OU; ways of exploiting intranet browsing history search (and potentially desktop and email search, too) with intranet search might also be amusing... People search also needs addressing (and it's not just me who thinks that...) - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006638.html">Expert Search</a> generalised (to leverage all the <em>other</em> sorts of knowledge that's bottled up and siloed away) would be worth a small investment from any large institution...</li><br />
<li><em>visualisations of....everything</em> :-) I keep managing to stumble across hierarchical, organisational charts (which I keep thinking could maybe provide a visual navigation tool - like the wikimindmap - to committee documents and minutes?) but it strikes me that committees are not really how the organisation is structured. What might a visualisation of the OU reveal if rendered as a "London Tube map": a) in which stations (nodes) were committees and lines (edges) were people who sit on those committees (<em>either</em> as individuals <em>or</em> as <em>ex officio</em> posts (the "<em>ex officio</em>, committee tube map!));or b) in which nodes were people (either named individuals <em>or</em> roles for an <em>ex officio</em> map view) and edges were committees/teams they are on. (There are loads of opportunities for visualising public OU web stats, OU course populations/student flow through courses, retention maps, course content browsing, etc etc, but neither of those are <em>intranet</em> related, really...)</li></ul></p>

<h3 class="title">open2.net - a 20th Century Innovation</h3>

Last week, an OU press release went out about a new OU/BBC series that airs later this month (July, 2007): James May's 20th Century (here's the BBC press release for Week 28 describing the show). If you'd like to see...

<p>Last week, an OU press release went out about a new OU/BBC series that airs later this month (July, 2007): <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=11351">James May's 20th Century</a> (here's the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk28/tue.shtml#tue_jmay">BBC press release for Week 28 describing the show</a>).</p>

<p>If you'd like to see a trailer of what's in store, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/bbc">official BBC presence on YouTube</a>, and in particular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yYcDJkmHrA">James May's 20th Century - Honey I Shrunk the World - BBCTwo</a>. I would embed the clip in this post, but apparently <em>Embedding disabled by request</em>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, a search for <em>james may</em> on the OU/BBC website <a href="http://open2.net">open2.net</a> doesn't turn up any references to the series (try the search here: <a href="http://www.open2.net/home/custom_search?entity_names=object&search_terms=james+may">search for <em>james may</em> on open2.net</a> (just by the by, 'advanced' search doesn't seem to work on the open2.net site - limiting the search to a phrase using quotes (e.g. <a href="http://www.open2.net/home/custom_search?entity_names=object&search_terms=%22james+may%22">"james may"</a>) gets a response of the form: <em>Your search for <strong>"james may"</strong> returned <strong>0</strong> result(s)</em>!).</p>

<p>Another Open2.net related media release last week proudly announced <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=11307">Open University television takes a step beyond TV channels into webspace</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Open University is offering a new way to view one of its fact-based programmes. The Open University's Open Broadcasting Unit's (OBU), annual Open University Broadband Lecture will debut today Tuesday June 26 via www.Open2.net.</blockquote><br />
<em>www.Open2.net</em> is <em>sic</em>, by the way - it's not a link...<br />
<blockquote>Each year's Open University Broadband Lecture will be presented by an OU academic in front of an invited audience. Professor Zarnecki's programme is available to watch online, or download as a MP3 audio only file.</blockquote><br />
Again, no links...</p>

<p>If you want to see the lecture, you can find it linked (in several separate parts) from <a href="http://www.open2.net/oulecture2007/">http://www.open2.net/oulecture2007/</a>.</p>

<p>The lecture is split into sections, with each section embedded in a movie player on a different page - the separate clips aren't even embedded as separate items in a single post, as in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html">"When T293 had its last presentation in 2001...": We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</a>, let alone a single show (like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html">Splashcast show version of that post</a>, which also makes the <a href="http://media.splashcast.net/xml/feeds/GIPJ3220JF.xml">components available via an RSS feed</a> (although not in the way that I'd have generated that feed...)).</p>

<p>There is no sharing/embed code, so I can't share the lecture with you directly...</p>

<p>I haven't checked, but I also suspect it is <em>not</em> (yet? ;-) available from either <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunesu/">iTunesU</a> or <a href="http://www.scitalks.com/">Scitalks</a>.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Open2.net still seems to be stuck very much at 1.0... (Those iCal/RSS programme feeds gone live yet, chaps? ;-)</p>

<p>What might Open2.0 look like, though?</p>

<p>Here's one possible take on it: the new <a href="http://cnn.com">CNN web2.0 redesign</a> (which was beta tested via a <a href="http://behindthescenes.blogs.cnn.com/">behind-the-scenes CNN blog</a>, I think). For a quick overview of what's new and innovative on the site, Read/WriteWeb has a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/cnn_launch_web_20_re-design.php">review</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>One of the reasons I put together <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html">We Ignore Digital Media at OU Peril - the Movie</a> earlier in the week is that it occurred to me that the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html">original post</a> was too long for a blog post really. Many people skim blogs for a quick info fix, but to go through the original post comprehensively would take about an hour if you watched the movies and followed all the links.</p>

<p>The movie is not much quicker to watch - but it is a different "user proposition": in this case, a (longish) video show...</p>

<p>It also occurred to me that we make HUGE assumptions about how our students spend time consuming our materials; if we have them for two hours at a time, or even for 1 hour, that would be a huge privilege. I have some reason to believe (;-) that some students on our online courses spend on average 15 minutes per visit to the course website (though I'm not sure how representative that simple average (mean, I think) is of the actual time spent on the site by actual individuals).</p>

<p>Many of our course materials are written with different size chunks in them - readings that take an hour, exercises that take half an hour, SAQs that take maybe 5 mins, maybe longer etc.</p>

<p>BUT there is no way a student can easily grab a bundle of 5 min chunks to consume while they're waiting at the bus stop, for example.</p>

<p>I think  - if we're clever - we may be able to chunk content in such a way that is can be packaged as shorts - a five minute clip with a bit of supporting text to frame why we're using the clip/what we want students to try and get out of the clip/what we want them to think about while they are watching it - or bundling those shorts into a longer package that generates its own momentum and keeps you engaged for a longer study period.</p>

<p>That is, I feel there ought to be a way we can come up with a menu of learning items that can be "snacked on" throughout the day, or sat down to for a full all-in-one-sitting "meal".</p>

<p>(Retaining the food imagery, the <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/">'Ever Wondered About Food?'</a> OU/BBC programme works like that, I think. A half hour program on a single topic/theme, with individual packages that each last 5/6 mins(?) and can be shown as standalone shorts, if required? Just in passing, several episodes of Ever Wondered About Food? also happen to be available as MP3 downloads: <a href="http://www.open2.net/everwonderedfood/podcasts.html">ever wondered about food? "podcast" page</a>. )</p>

<p>My formal training in media studies etc is zero - so this may all be so much nonsense. But then again, developing visual narrative skills internally, and via course offerings, is something I think we should be doing, so I'm happy to be self-experimenting on this... ;-)</p>

<p>Although something like the "peril movie" is NOT meant to demonstrate a potential vehicle for delivery (or assessment) in its current format - there is arguably too little critical analysis for that (although finding appropriate movies can be difficult at times) - it is partly intended  to offer a start to ways in which we might explore how several multimedia clips from the web can be bundled into a chunk that lasts 10 mins,  20 mins, 30 mins, an hour etc. with textual inserts used to hint at a narrative structure.</p>

<p>I mailed some of the above comments around various people internally, as well as to the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk/eating/">EATING</a> group (ha! - food again...;-) and it turned up in response a few pointers to people who were already experimenting with such things.</p>

<p>It also turned up a couple of multimedia annotation tools that are being explored for potential use in the context of a particular online open content project...<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://diver.stanford.edu/what.html">DIVER</a>: "DIVER is a tool for authoring and sharing DIVES. A DIVE is an annotated perspective on any video record. Content can be captured by equipment ranging from basic consumer video cameras to specially built, high-resolution 360-degree panoramic cameras with a multi-microphone array."</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.matrix.msu.edu/~mmatrix/">[mediamatrix]</a>: "MediaMatrix is an online application that allows users to isolate, segment, and annotate digital media."</li></ul></p>

<p>Internal readers may also like to check out the <a href="https://intranet-gw.open.ac.uk/lts/production-process/9500_media.htm">video narrative explorer</a> developed for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/da204">Understanding Media</a> course, as well as the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/observationskills/p4_5.shtml">fOCUs video annotation tool</a> developed for an observational psychology course (<em>why</em> is there no video demo of this available...?!)</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to explore the various tools that are out there for cobbling together video resources from public sources, here are a few more to get you started:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.vuvox.com/">Vuvox</a>, a online presentation builder. Add flickr photos, youTube movies etc to a customised online presentation;</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.scenemaker.net/">Scenemaker</a> lets you edit <em>any</em> YouTube movie, whereas the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ytremixer_about">"official" YouTube Remixer</a> (built on top of Adobe Premiere Express, which also underpins the <a href="http://press.photobucket.com/blog/2007/03/remix_service_a.html">Photobucket online movie remix tool</a>... hmmm....) only lets you edit/remix your <em>own</em> movie uploads (at the moment...).</li><br />
<li><a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">Splashcast</a>, the service I used to deliver the peril movies. Add multiple YouTube movies to a show in one go if they are on the same page (like a playlist page...), Powerpoint presentations (each slide becomes a separate image - handy if you want ot rearrange them or insert movies etc.), Flickr images and even PDFs...</li></ul></p>

<p>[I need to tweak the embed code to play the correct movie at the start - if <em>The Future of Photography</em> plays, you need to hover top left and select the Channel Guide...]</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/so/2/p/HJSH3537QK/s/IVTH3836KD" wmode="transparent" width="400" height="300" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /><table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=GIPJ3220JF" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add OUseful Stories to your page</font></a></td></tr></table></p>

<p>If you can;t see the embedded movie player above, <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/preview/?s=IVTH3836KD">see the show here...</a></p>

<p>SplashCast has a neat feature that will import any YouTube movies it finds on a page, so the only thing I had to do to import the movies into the show was to pick the "Movies from YouTube" option, and paste in the URL of the original blog post...</p>

<p>Earlier this week, John Monk demoed some 30s assessment shorts, audio/visual clips on various topics that he was suggesting would be a good format for assessment.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>Maybe John will share his thoughts on YouTube, or via a Splashcast channel. John...?</p>

<h3 class="title">ICT Resource Digger - fOUndit</h3>

Not of my doing, but totally in keeping with the OUseful philosophy, John Woodthorpe has just opened up fOUndit, a Digg like environment being tested as a resource discovery, social recommendation and current awareness tool to support OU ICT courses....

<p>Not of my doing, but totally in keeping with the OUseful philosophy, <a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/">John Woodthorpe</a> has just opened up <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk">fOUndit</a>, a Digg like environment being tested as a resource discovery, social recommendation and current awareness tool to support OU ICT courses.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5074762093383207778"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm0tPJe5S2I/AAAAAAAAAEU/hQKHnZAsXmI/s800/foundit.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p><em>Social news</em> sites like this allow readers to submit and vote on news stories of interest to community members - in the case of fOUndit, the initial audience is the "T175 community" (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t175">T175</a> being an OU course on <em>Networked living: exploring information and communication technologies</em>; you can get a taste of the course here: <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/search.php?search=T175">T175 on OpenLearn</a>).</p>

<p>The service - which runs on the <a href="http://www.pligg.com/">Pligg</a> Digg clone  (<a href="http://www.pligg.com/blog">Pligg blog</a>) - has actually been in testing for a few weeks now (<a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/wordpress/?s=pligg">John's posts on OU Pligg</a>.</p>

<p>With services like <a href="http://www.corank.com/">coRank</a> offering hosted social news sites (so you can get something like your own Digg/Pligg without having to install anything on a server) it's now easy enough to set up and run your own site. The question then, of course, is building a community around it.</p>

<p>Anyway - it'll be interesting to see how <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk">fOUndit</a> takes off... there are several ways it could go I think:</p>

<p>- current awareness for course team and ALs (providing links of interest that may be worth mentioning to students);<br />
- as a student info sharing site - something like <a href="">Social ROUTES</a>;<br />
- as a 'keeping current' site for course alumni - keeping them in touch/up-to-date with the area <em>after</em> the end of the course (after all, all it takes is a subscription to the <a href="http://foundit.open.ac.uk/Pligg/rss.php">fOUndit RSS feed</a>);<br />
- as a "course issues" site for <em>potential</em> students.</p>

<p>Now I wonder, how could a course or programme social news site be designed to satisfy all those target groups, along with providing course tasters on OpenLearn for potential students and (authentication protected) access to live course info for current students and staff. </p>

<p>One of the things I've thought for a long time is that we should be upping the prominence of "current awareness", ,em>optional</em> wider reading on course related issues and so on... (I know, I know, if it's optional why would students read it... BECAUSE it provides current context for the stuff being studied, that's why...! ;-) Placing a feed from fOUndit on the course front page, cf. the feed I have taken from delicious on the T184 website, would be one way of making foundit content available to current students and ALs.<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5074776159401102194"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/Rm06B5e5S3I/AAAAAAAAAEk/IuWm-lJ5e9Q/s800/t184frontpage.png" /></a></p>

<p>PS I keep on wondering too whether the social recommendation approach can be used for live informal learning production, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007457.html">OpenLearnigg</a> style... ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">An Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</h3>

In the previous post, I described a Pageflakes tab that publishes feeds from a variety of OU bloggers who blog about OU related matters. This page is one of a set of shared Pageflakes tabs I popped up some time...
<!--
<p>In the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010376.html">previous post</a>, I described a Pageflakes tab that publishes feeds from a variety of OU bloggers who blog about OU related matters. This page is one of a set of shared Pageflakes tabs I popped up some time ago as a pain-free redesign of the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a>*. It strikes me these tabs actually represent a basic, example pattern for an institutional information/news dashboard, so here's a brief explanation of how the page was put together.</p>

<p>Firstly - let's look at the setup. I'm actually sharing four tabs: <em>OUseful</em>, <em>OUt There</em>, <em>OU in the News</em> and the aforementioned <em>OU Bloggers</em>. Each of these tabs displays several panels that contain links to web content, including news stories, blog posts, OU press releases and calendar items.</p>

<p>Each panel is loaded <em>live</em> whenever you load the page. This means that when you visit the page, you'll be presented with <em>current</em> (most recent) content, updated automatically on your behalf.</p>

<p>By scanning just these four tabs, you can quickly review live content from thirteen blogs, four saved news searches, four saved social media searches, three institutional news feeds and a calendar feed; that's the equivalent of visiting twenty five different webpages from almost twenty websites in one go...</p>

<p><strong>OUseful</strong> <em>ego page</em></p>

<p>The <em>first</em> tab (<em>OUseful</em>) is largely a personal (ego) page, although it also relays events from the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar">OUseful calendar</a>, in which I collect dates of OU talks and events likely to be of interest to OUseful.info readers.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025135594261298"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBe5e5SzI/AAAAAAAAADo/D7zfqTImG94/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab1.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column is an "About" tab that contains links to the 'major' OUseful properties. (I really do need to add some "About" information to this tab!). The <em>Interesting Links</em> are piped in from delicious. Most social bookmarking sites provide feeds for resources tagged by a particular use in a particular way, which means you can run several separate bookmarking panels - each with their own flavour of content - from a single social bookmarking account. (Of course, you can also create panels that display feeds from other people's social bookmark accounts).. There is also a Grazr widget that embeds a search over OpenLearn materials - search results appear in the widget itself (fed from an RSS feed obtained by scraping the OU search engine resutls page with Dapper).</p>

<p>In the centre column is a list of links to the major OUseful sites (again...hmmm - I really need to fix that "About" tab...), a list of the presentations I have uploaded to Slideshare, and a list of my H2O playlists. As and when I start uploading to content to Scribd, I'll probably add a tab of uploaded/shared documents to this column too. </p>

<p>In the right hand column is a feed from my blog, <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a>. The calendar panel takes in a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/calendar/">feed from the OUseful calendar</a>, which is actually a public Google Calendar showing upcoming events likely to be of interest to internal <em>OUseful.info</em> readers.. If you run a Google Calendar, it's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=37648">easy enough to find the feed</a>.</p>

<p>Although this first tab is largely feeding ego-related content, the blend of resources does represent a pattern of a sort: <em>About</em> info; a selection of OUseful links and favourite links; links to my uploaded, shared content; 'informal' or 'grass roots' news from my <em>blog</em> feed (in the general case, this could be an aggregated feed from OU bloggers, a feed from the OU Facebook network, for example); and a <em>calendar/events</em> feed.</p>

<p><strong>OUt There</strong> News Feeds<br />
 <br />
The <em>second tab</em> (<em>OUt There</em>) contains panels fed by public OU feeds. The aim of this tab is to provide a quick scan of information that the OU is syndicating for public consumption:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025127004326690"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBeZe5SyI/AAAAAAAAADg/JFnKaoz6xAA/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab2.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column is a feed from Sesame, the OU community newspaper. This feed provides headline stories from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/">Sesame</a> website.</p>

<p>In the centre column is a panel that displays headlines from the latest <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/">OU press releases</a>. </p>

<p>In the right hand column is a feed of recent job vacancies. One thing I was considering was to filter the jobs feed (probably using a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipe</a>) so that it only passed jobs likely to be of interest to OUseful readers (e.g. jobs in AACS, the Library, LTS, KMi, as well as wider posts relating to elearning, search, and so on). At the moment, though, the jobs feed is just taken directly from the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/employment">OU recruitment website</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> web team are currently experimenting with BBC/OU broadcast schedule feeds, and as soon as these are officially published I'll pass them through to a panel on the <em>OUt There</em> tab.</p>

<p><strong>OU in the News</strong></p>

<p>The <em>third</em> tab (<em>OU in the News</em>) relays headlines from a variety of news search engines, as well as a blog search and some other social media site searches. The idea behind this tab is to provide an overview of news stories and blogosphere stories relating to the OU. At the moment, all the searches use the same search query term, the phrase <em>"Open University</em> (or, where a tag is required, the tag <em>openuniversity</em>): </p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5073025118414392082"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmcBd5e5SxI/AAAAAAAAADY/lN9gHXMj3o8/s800/ousefulPageflakesTab3.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>In the left hand column, the tab displays the top news stories in the UK as returned by Google news (this query uses the <em>location:uk</em> search limit). The panel displays a large number of results under the assumption that OU news stories are most likely to be reported by UK local and national media. On the to do list is a mapped representation of this feed (in which stories would be plotted at appropriate locations on a Google map).</p>

<p>In the centre column are searches on the Google, Yahoo and Microsoft Live news sites. As no search limits are applied to these searches, results will, therefore, include international news stories.</p>

<p>In the right hand column are several searches over social media: a search over YouTube movies where the OU is mentioned (this is actually a domain limited search using Live search, although a tag based feed retrieval might also be appropriate?); a search over blogs using Google blogsearch (I should perhaps also add in a Technorati search here?); and two tag based feeds pulled in from delicious - one on popular links tagged "openuniversity", and the other the most recent links with that tag.</p>

<p>Arguably, I could set up panels for (ar another tab for) "standard web search" searches, to provide an at a glance view of what users searching for "open university" on the Google, Yahoo or Microsoft search properties would see if they made that search. However, unlike the news search, these links are unlikely to change much each time you visit the page.</p>

<p><strong>OU Bloggers</strong></p>

<p>The <em>fourth</em> tab (<em>OU Bloggers</em>) contains feeds from OU bloggers who blog about OU matters in their blogs:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5072857524495534850"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmZpCpe5SwI/AAAAAAAAADI/cc3hlWzm-HI/s800/pageflakesOUbloggers.png" style="border:0" /></a></p>

<p>The left and middle columns are dominated at the top by personal blogs - the panels at the bottom of those columns have more of a flavour of "project related" blogs.</p>

<p>In the right hand column are several blogs that are dominated by posts relating to OpenLearn matters.</p>

<p>If the number of OU blogs increases, then it may be appropriate to spread the panels in this tab over several tabs, covering personal, project/work area, course and OpenLearn related topics, perhaps?</p>

<p><em>How it Works</em></p>

<p>Most of the tabs display content fed live in to the page via RSS feeds, demonstrating that <a href"http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>. There are only two exceptions, both on the first OUseful tab, that actually use static 'note' panels containing fixed, pre-specified links. The feeds are provided natively by the originating services (except the OpenLearn search) although the YouTube feed had to be finessed using a domain specific search from Microsoft Live search.</p>

<p>Feeds can be added individually to the original Pageflakes page, or in bulk via an OPML file. [Added: I actually pulled in the blog feeds via the OPML file from my "OU Bloggers" folder on Bloglines, using this trick: <a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/17/grazr-and-bloglines/">using Bloglines as an OPML manager</a>.] I will try to post an OPML generator that creates feed bundles along the lines of the patterns described above in the next week or two.</p>

<p>If you want to set up your own Pageflakes page, it's very easy to do: simply register at <a href="http://pageflakes.com">pageflakes.com</a> and then click on the likely looking links! To add RSS feeds, go to the web pages whose content you'd like to view via Pageflakes and look for the orange RSS feed icons: copy the URLs these link to and then add the URLs to the Pageflakes page via the "Add Feed" option.</p>

<p>It takes 20-30 minutes to put to series of tabs like the ones displayed on <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> together. As well as Pageflakes, there are other services that offer similar functionality - and that work in exactly the same way -  most notably <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personal Pages/iGoogle</a> and <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>. If anyone would like a demo, either for a one-to-one, seminar or workshop format, feel free to get in touch.</p>

<p><em>* To preserve the <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> URL in the browser address bar on the OUseful homepage, I use the page <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/index.html</em> which contains a frame into which I load the shared Pageflakes page.</em></p>

<p>Earlier today - err, that is, yesterday - <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/10/uk-gov-youtube-better-than-yourminis-demo/">Marc</a> posted about a YourMinis page he put together on an <em>eGov</em> theme in a live demo to some eGov visitors to <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> last year.</p>

<p>Quite by chance, I'd been doodling with a <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a> page for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a> that pulls in live search info relating to the Open University, partly in response to a quick skim through a draft document reviewing environmental/horizon scanning across the OU by the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/planning/futures/">OU Futures Office</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOUsearch.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOUsearch.png" width="1027" height="562" border="0" /></p>

<p>Although the Pageflakes page only took 20 mins or so to put together, I was intrigued as to how much time Marc put into preparing for his 5 minute 'create an eGov page in 5 mins' demo. I asked, and it turns out it took a couple of hours the day before, apparently, and then set up/browser priming time on the day...</p>

<p>If you've been thinking about doing a live demo to show off how quickly you can pull a page together from feeds and widgets, his post about the real story behind the time it takes to do a 5 minute demo is well worth reading: <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/11/5-minute-yourminis-demo-no-way/">5 minute YourMinis demo? No way!</a></p>

<p>It includes tricks such as bookmarking the resources you're likely to call on well in advance, having a run through on the environment you want to build, and priming your browser by preloading tabs with pages you're going to feed from. Good stuff.... Go <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/05/11/5-minute-yourminis-demo-no-way/">read it now</a>...</p>

<p>[Related to that is this post from a while back by Matt McAlister: <a href="http://www.mattmcalister.com/blog/2006/09/22/96/how-to-give-a-90-second-demo/">How to give a 90 second demo</a>.]</p>

<p>Returning to the OU scanning review for a moment, one of the comments I made was difficult it seems to be to get hold of search referral and site search data that may provide useful info to curriculum planners at faculty and departmental level. (It might also be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">fun to play with ;-)</a>.)</p>

<p>Reading Battelle just now, we could also make use of incoming referrals from Google to  provide "Maybe you're also interested in this?" search results: <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/003625.php">Cool New Search Referral Widget Live on Searchblog</a>.</p>

<p>This maybe does imply that out internal search engine is at least as good as Google... which I think is arguable. An email last week from a regular reader of this site - and member of the OU community - suggested that he used Google to search the OU domain rather than the OU search engine itself....</p>

<p>...and you know what, so do I: using the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Aopen.ac.uk">site:open.ac.uk</a> search limit...</p>

<p>(ooh.... this is interesting just doing a blank search on that: <a href="http://rfsmoodle.open.ac.uk/">Rocks From Space</a>, an informal, Moodled learning environment. Good stuff... not as friendly as it might be, of course, but a good initiative...)</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Computing Forecasts</h3>

<!--
<p>To what extend could we - and/or should we - be encouraging students to use Web 2.0 tools, either off their own back, or via institutional systems?</p>

<p>Last week, I ran a 'partial attention format workshop' on "<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010277.html">Visioning Web 2.OU Personal Learning Environments</a>" at the OU's annual (if namechanging!) <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/CTSSconference/">Curriculum Teaching and Student Support (CTSS) Conference</a> (it used to feature the word <em>technology</em> in the conference title.... hmmm... but then, as one PVC observed during the week, we aren't necessarily as up to speed with elearning as we might be, either in terms of technology tracking and adoption, or elearning pedagogy...). Whilst I was preparing for it, I was in two minds whether to go down the 'here are results from elsewhere' route. Time ran out on me, though, so here are some of the notes I was cobbling together but didn't use, as well as a couple of related links I've come across in the last day or two...</p>

<p>The context for using these notes would have been something along the lines of getting a handle on the processes by which we might encourage students into the web 2.0 way of working (see this <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/Home/news/stories/2007/03/news_web2,-d-,0.aspx">JISC report on web 2.0 tools</a> for more info, [UPDATE: or this more recent report: <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/digital_repositories/web2-content-learning-and-teaching.pdf">Web 2.0 Content Sharing for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education</a>, also for JISC, by Tom Franklin and Mark van Harmelen]), as well as trying to forecast the timescale on which significant rates of adoption of these learning technologies might be anticipated in adult higher education.</p>

<p>A report published a couple of weeks ago by Forrester's <a href="http://forrester.typepad.com/charleneli/">Charlene Li</a> introduced the idea of <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,42057,00.html">Social Technographics</a>, an analytic technique that attempts to classify consumers according to their level of participation in "social computing behaviours" - that is, participation in ICT mediated (online?) social activity.</p>

<p><em>Social technographics</em> builds on the idea of <em>technographics</em>, another Forrester tool, which may be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Now-Never-Companies-Internet-Consumers/dp/1587990415">described as</a> "measur[ing] consumers' attitudes towards technology". </p>

<p>(The <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org">Pew/Internet: Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> also have a lot to say about this, as for example their recent <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_ICT_Typology.pdf">Typology of Information and Communication Technology Users Report</a> demonstrates. To see which type of user you are - <em>omnivore, connector, lacklustre veteran, productivity enhancer, mobile centric, connected but hassled, inexperienced experimenter, light but satisfied, indifferent, or off the net</em> - try out their <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/quiz/">quiz</a>.)</p>

<p>Li's research forms part of a book project  - <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2007/05/groundswell_the.html">Groundswell</a> ("a spontaneous movement of people connecting, using online tools, taking charge of their own experience, and getting what they need â€“ information, support, ideas, products, and bargaining power â€“ from each other") - which is being developed, in part, via the blog.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly caught my eye in the report is their "participation ladder", which can be used to identify the extent to which consumers participate in those activities:</p>

<p><img alt="forresterLadder.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/forresterLadder.png" width="455" height="419" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that users of different services or websites may be on different rungs of the ladder in terms of the extent to which they actively participate on those sites.</p>

<p>In certain respects, the ladder unpicks the <a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=5">creator/synthesizer/consumer pyramid</a>, which demonstrates in an even more powerful, diagrammatic, way the different levels of participation in terms of user population share across creators, synthesizers consumers:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.elatable.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/pyramid.gif" /></p>

<p>The formulation of a Web2.OU strategy could do worse than bearing in mind the Social Technographics data and the way users might climb the participation ladder (as well as moving through Pew Internet's classes of technology user).</p>

<p>In addition, a consideration of the time to (mass) adoption of particular technologies universally, as well as amongst different demographics, would be appropriate. Although the OU in its current incarnation tends to operate on near geological timescales (!), there is little point in making a push <em>now</em> to adopt technologies that will not be mature (in the sense of being stable enough to have become widely adopted) within the next 3 years. Although there <em>is</em> a point in tracking those technologies and softly developing ideas about how we might exploit them.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for being wary of too early adoption is that the rate of change of development in web technologies is ferocious at the moment, with large numbers of start-ups making land grabs for web based application areas: movie editing, photo editing, online office suites, content sharing, and so on.</p>

<p>The next 18 months at least are also likely to see the large media companies struggle to identify new business models as they experiment with content delivery models that do not involve Digital Rights Management (DRM). TVOIP/IPTV (internet TV) is just now becoming a reality, with download services already available from Channel 4 (4od) (and ITV anytime?), <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> is opening up invites all the time, the <a href="www.apple.com/appletv">Apple TV</a> is shipping (and is being <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/">hacked to bits</a>), the BBC iPlayer is approved and waiting release and the BBC Archive Download trial also about to start.</p>

<p>The flurry of free online applications that have appeared on the web over the last two years will start having to look for sustainable business models and carve out, if they can, a niche market in the face of online office suites. Google are already two thirds of the way there (with Google Docs and Google spreadsheets), and they have a presentation suite on the way. Zoho have a compelling range of integrated online office tools, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zimbra_comcast_plaxo_hp.php">Zimbra have just signed a deal with Comcast</a>. </p>

<p>What is lacking at the moment from many of these suites is offline working: but that may not be for long... (<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zimbra_desktop_offline_web_apps.php">Zimbra</a> is already there, for example...) In late 2007, the 'online only' nature of the web will be challenged further with the introduction of browser implemented offline storage in Firefox 3.0 and offline runners from Adobe and Microsoft(?). Indeed, the Dojo offline  toolkit <em>already</em> provides support for offline storage.</p>

<p>By tracking these technologies, we build up expertise in the technical details, and can maybe even contribute to their development (at a distance!) through early adopter demos and blog commentaries we have produced.</p>

<p>Lest we spread ourselves too thinly, of course, we need to focus on the technologies that our students are most likely ot use - or maybe already are using.</p>

<p>The most recent hook into this for me is "<a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/2007-horizon-report">The Horizon Report (2007 Edition)</a>", published by the New Media Consortium and Educause <a href="http://www.nmc.org/horizon"><em>Horizon Project</em></a>, which "charts the landscape of emerging technologies for teaching, learning and creative expression" </p>

<p>The structure of this report is based on a series of time-to-adoption technology forecasts over periods less than one year, two to three year and four to five year timescales. </p>

<p>(It would be interesting to see how these forecasts compare with the placement of corresponding technologies on the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475">Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle for 2006</a>, (and  - when it comes out later this year -  the 2007 report), as well as the Hype Cycles for <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=493556">elearning</a> and <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=493481">Higher Education</a>.)</p>

<p>Also relevant is the <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/survey-summary.pdf">Online Tool Use Survey</a> undertaken as part of the JISC funded <a href="http://spire.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">SPIRE project</a>. This project was "originally looking into the possibility of using peer-to-peer technologies in UK HE and FE for informal sharing but switched to a more Web 2.0 focus as it became clear that these types of services were already having an impact on the tertiary education sector", <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2007/03/16/some-real-data-on-web-20-use/ ">apparently</a>.  The report contains some interesting data on the current use of "Web 2.0" tools by students currently in UK Higher Education.</p>

<p>Martin blogged some of the headline results as he saw them <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/03/web_20_usage_at.html">in a post some time ago</a>. Here is one of the highlight charts for me:</p>

<p><img alt="oxfordWeb2ools.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oxfordWeb2ools.png" width="500" height="612" border="0" /></p>

<p>Okay - this post has gone on way too long, with more than enough reading for anyone who follows even a fraction of the links. It's an area I'll intend to keep returning to, though, hopefully in a little more depth and with a bit more critical analysis.</p>

<h3 class="title">Visioning Web 2.OU  (Partial Attention Workshop Format)</h3>

<p>Earlier this week I ran a workshop on "Visioning Web2.OU Personal Learning Environments" at the OU CTSS Conference. I'd lost the original abstract, so as far I was concerned I had a clean canvas to play with, subject the content bearing some relevance to the title.</p>

<p>I've tried running several interactive workshops before, both in seminar/meeting rooms (as for <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/insearchofthegoogLE/">In search of the googLE</a> (<- that page needs updating with <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/in-search-of-the-google/">slides via slideshare</a> and <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/106431">links via an H20 playlist</a>) and the OU Library IT Training Suite, which is where last week's workshop was held.</p>

<p>The first 'interactive' workshop I ever ran in the IT Training Suite event was on social bookmarking (before the days of slideshare - though I'll dig out the presentation and get it uploaded there <em>if</em> I can find the machine it's archived on!). That workshop was run almost along 'traditional' lines - I put links up and got people to follow along with what I was doing, with elements of free exploration - like free-for-all pivot searching on tags and users in delicious.</p>

<p>This time, I thought I'd try and run the workshop so that participants behaved as I behave in a 'normal' conference session (presentation, not workshop). That is, I sit there with my laptop, following links mentioned by the presenter, looking people who are mentioned up on Amazon (and maybe adding one or two of their books to my wishlist for a further look, post presentation), googling all sorts, and pre-blogging notes about the talk.</p>

<p>In other words, I only give the speaker my <em>partial attention</em> but I give the bits of topic that are relevant, meaningful and or useful to me my <em>whole</em> attention.</p>

<p>Disrespectful to the speaker? Maybe - but it means I come away with a personal resource package based on the presentation that I can always refer back to, develop further, post to the blog (= share with others who maybe couldn't attend the session), and so on.</p>

<p>One thing I've found about this approach is that I can't be doing with presentation slides full of text - which is one reason why I try not to fill my slides with lots of text heavy bullet points. Keywords and links do it for me when I'm following a presentation - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010272.html"><em>glanceability</em></a> is the key.</p>

<p>My audio attention (?) is pretty much dedicated to the speaker (as well as the audience - sighs, laughs, mutterings etc.;-), but my visual attention is split between the speaker's face/body language, glances at slides, and my laptop screen.</p>

<p>So - at the start of the workshop, I primed the audience along the lines of: "I'm going to ramble on a theme, pop up some links on screen, mention lots of others. Feel free to chase down those links that interest you and only listen to the bits of the talk that catch your attention, ask questions whenever you like and pick me up when your googling proves something I've said is wrong."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the slides correspondingly only capture a part of what was covered in the session (you can check them out here: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psychemedia/visioning-web20u/1">"Visioning Web 2.OU Personal Learning Environments" on slideshare</a>):</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=44591&doc=visioning-web20u-8260" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=44591&doc=visioning-web20u-8260" /></object></p>

<p>I had intended to put together an H2O playlist, but that's still on the to do list. Certainly, I need to find a way of effectively link sharing during this sort of presentation, pushing links to people as I mention them (rather than providing them all up front) so they can follow them at the time; a link presenter, if you like (maybe like <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006041.html">deliShow</a>, although that requires the links to be queued up in the correct order in advance. Maybe a <em>link jockey</em> would be the answer (cf. a <a href="http://www.educause.edu/content.asp?page_id=666&ID=ELI7014&bhcp=1">Google jockey</a>) who pushes links out to the audience as the speaker mentions them - and maybe feeds links back to the presenter from the audience?</p>

<p>For the links that are mentioned in the presentation, I maybe need to flash them up in a large font for a few seconds before displaying the slide? Or have a slide design that prominently displays a relevant URL.</p>

<p>Did it work? <A href="http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2007/05/02/3949">Not for me to say</a>, though I did get this comment back:<br />
<blockquote>I thought it was good that you said people should feel free to explore things while you were talking. It meant that Chris and Martin felt free to type their notes into emails/blogs too [this is <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/05/my_daughters_mu.html">the post Martin was working on</a> - and yes, I do that in other people's presentations too...], rather than just sitting staring at you. I think that format worked for the people who were there. It might have been off-putting to beginners who wanted hand-holding, but I'm sure other participants would have supplied the hand-holding if asked. Basically, I found it easier to stay focussed than I would have if you'd either expected us to just listen & watch or only look stuff up when you told us to, which is the way people usually present in that room.</blockquote></p>

<p>Would I do a workshop in that way again? Almost definitely, though I'd try and make sure there was a link playlist available beforehand.</p>

<p>And did anyone Google me wrong? You betcha - I got picked up on my misquoting of William Gibson (first slide, proper...)</p>

<!--
<p>One of the <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/05/01/full-house/">keynotes at the OU''s recent CTSS conference</a> was <a href="http://james.cridland.net/">James Cridland</a>, currently digital media director at <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/">Virgin Radio</a>, but soon to be Head of Future Media  and Technology, Audio and Music <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/05/03/to-the-bbc/">at the BBC</a>.</p>

<p>By far the slickest presentation delivered over the two day conference, <em>Control and Community in the Multi-Platform World</em> provided an overview of some of the ways in which Virgin Radio is using technology to deliver content and community to where it's audience wants it, whether that's via the radio, web or mobile device. In short, a presentation about "a strong brand, communicating".</p>

<p>Invoking Bob Garfield's <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=45561">Chaos</a> and <a href="http://adage.com/article.php?article_id=115712">Chaos 2.0</a> scenarios, (on the death of mass media and mass marketing), the point was well made that whilst mass media are reaching ever smaller audiences, the new media still do not tend to reach large audiences; a consequence of which is that there will be no media capable of meeting demands of the advertising and mass marketing sectors. Except <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12100B4BRLTE">via a Google advertising monopoly</a>, maybe!</p>

<p>(<a href="http://edtechie.net">Martin</a>, you gonna do a piece on the OU Chaos scenario: the death of long courses and the formal learning student?!)</p>

<p>With new media portable DAB radio players, such as the <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/computeractive/hardware/2166731/review-virgin-mobile-lobster">Virgin Mobile Lobster</a> (with its red button for interactive use, no less) or this <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/01/24/iriver-dab-slideshow/">iRiver DAB Slideshow player</a>, and web based players like the <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/listen">Virgin Media Player</a> (reviewed when it was in beta for a day before launch <a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2007/03/playing_with_the_virgin_radio.php">here</a>, and mentioned in passing by yours truly in the context of a post about a "<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009962.html">RadiOU</a>"), adding a visual component to radio broadcasts is now standard practice.</p>

<p>The Virgin Media player also combines the ability to play radio with the ability to play video. Will the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> do the same, I wonder? (I'm guessing at the URL - the 401 looks promising...)</p>

<p>However, whilst the visual component to radio is not just using limited to scrolling liveText displays, nor does it mean moving wholesale into television: the key is to support <em>glanceability</em>, a beautifully evocative word referring to the ability to look at a screen and capture the information you require <em>at a glance</em>.</p>

<p>Perfect for checking the name of the artist - or track - currently playing, for example, and providing visual cues that engage the audience just that little bit more, making the channel stickier and the listener (viewer?) just that little bit less likely to tune away.</p>

<p>(For a 2004 take on why the move to digital radio broadcast over the aether is so compelling compared to current FM analogue broadcasts, read the <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/pdf/dab_review.pdf ">BBC's submission to the DCMS Review of DAB Digital Radio</a>.)</p>

<p>Radio delivery is not just via the traditional 'radio' of course. Many mobile phones now offer multiple ways of accessing a radio station (via FM, DAB, the web, and so on), each with their own licensing requirements.</p>

<p>Two points James made about the Virgin Radio website particularly stood out for me: firstly, how abusive or unwanted contact from other users is handled on the social parts of the website - if an unwanted visitor is posting content on your site, you can simply choose to <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/vip/?action=editprofile&submode=ignore">ignore</a> them. The user can continue to post, and will think all is working fine, but <em>only they</em> will be able to see the (otherwise ignored) content they have posted. The cunning part comes when the same person is ignored by many users - then the system will set a global ignore flag. The user will continue to post, oblivious to the fact that only they can see their content. Beautiful :-) Although subject to abuse and community powered censorship, perhaps?</p>

<p>The comment that "peer production" and user-generated content are important <em>but</em> that brands should be guarantors of production quality and quality content was also well made. In the VIrgin Radio case, anything goes in community areas of the site, subject to self-regulation, whereas what goes on air is strictly controlled. This distinction is worth bearing in mind as the OU moves forward, I think.</p>

<p>Secondly was a comment I reused in a web 2.0 presentation yesterday:  the "Virgin [Radio] website is a website for the sort of people who like to listen to the music that is played on Virgin Radio."</p>

<p>Perfect :-)</p>

<p>Can the same be said of the OU site, I wonder, or the <a href="http://open2.net">open2.net</a> site, if we replace 'Virgin Radio listener' with 'OU student' (or 'OU alumnus')? </p>

<p>Hmmm.... although once again, the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair">OpenLearn comms team</a> are hinting at possible ways forward on this score: <a href="http://openlearn.ning.com">OpenLearn Community</a>. I'm <em>so glad</em> they have no developer resource, and have to make do with what they can find on the web... ;-)</p>

<p>Finally, issues surrounding the definition and collection of appropriate metrics was raised, both for subscription content in general, and audio content in general (how do you know if someone has listened to a track, for example? [Err - get everyone <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">scrobbling</a>, maybe?]</p>

<p>Tracking and analytics are something that just doesn't appear to be happening here in the OU yet, even for something as simple as tracking simple website user behaviour (or if it is, its not getting to the course teams). I couldn't tell you, for example, whether any student on any of the 5(?) presentations of the online T184 course has ever looked at one of the course web pages, let alone followed any of the external links  from them; or played any of the movies. (A <em>cunning plan</em> is in place to try and address this issue, though ;-)</p>

<p>Just in passing, and sort of related in a hint dropping sort of way in case James C reads this on his way to the Beeb, I'm hoping we'll get to play with the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11766ad2-f6b7-11db-9812-000b5df10621,_i_rssPage=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340.html">BBC iPlayer</a> sometime soon; (I'm also personally signed up to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6568163.stm">BBC Archive trial</a> - though I haven't been invited in yet, so maybe I didn't get a place... So much for having a strategic grass roots relationship between the OU, open2.net and the BBC new media developers!).</p>

<p>The OU Broadcast review is also trundling along (check out Martin Weller's CTSS presentation on the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mweller/the-ou-and-broadcast/1">OU Broadcast Review</a> for more info), so it'll be interesting to see where that leads over the next 18 months or so.</p>

<p>Each of the two OU Curriculum, Teaching and Student Support (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/CTSSconference/">CTSS</a>) Conference  days this week ended with plenary session, with panels made up from the great and the good in the OU hierarchy. Yesterday's panel session included <a href="http://memex.naughtons.org">John Naughton</a>, who dared to mention the 'word' RSS, to blank stares from many in the audience and most of the panel.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>In today's panel, an unpicked upon, throwaway comment  - in what I thought sounded like a mocking tone - about "John Naughton's RSS feeds, ha, ha" suggested to me RSS is something that some may have heard about, but have little understanding of.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>As a publishing medium, RSS offers two significant benefits to the OU and other e-learning providers. Firstly, it provides a mechanism by which users can <em>subscribe</em> to content delivered by the RSS feed and receive it at a time of their choosing. Secondly, it provides a medium for <em>syndicating</em> that content, allowing users to republish it (that is, view it) in a location of their choosing.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p><em>Subscription</em> is familiar idea in many areas of publishing. To see how subscription works with RSS feeds, <a href="http://www.blip.tv/file/205570?filename=Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.flv">watch this</a>. When you <em>subscribe</em> to a service, you enter into a <em>trusted relationship</em> with the service provider. Within the context of that relationship, you might expect to receive a certain type of content, maybe at a regular interval, maybe on demand, for the duration of subscription term. Ideally, you, as subscriber, should be able to terminate the subscription, without penalty, at any time. Control rests with you - the user. As we move away from a world dominated by broadcast media to one dominated by user-defined channels, RSS feeds will provide a key part of the 'hidden wiring' - or plumbing - for this new world.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Typically, RSS feeds allow users to subscribe to websites and receive content updates, via the  feed, as and when fresh content is posted. Another class of RSS feeds - <em>static RSS feeds</em>  - contain fixed content, such as the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009142.html">content of a course</a>, or chapters of a book. Users can subscribe to static feeds using services like <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, which deliver the feed items as bite sized "chunks" of content, once a day (or once a week, or twice a week, whatever), starting on the day you subscribe and continuing to deliver content according to a specified schedule until the last fixed item in the feed (such as the last chapter in the book, or the last section of the course unit) has been delivered. <em>The subscription to the feed continues until the user takes the positive action to unsubscribe</em>. For static feeds, the direct, user-initiated, trusted link to the user continues (unless they unsubscribe) even after all the content in the static feed has been delivered. This offers the opportunity to offer after-care, or cross-selling of other content feeds.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>One way of thinking about content delivered by RSS, compared to delivering via a website, is to consider the world of film. Visiting a website to consume content is like going to the cinema. You have to physically visit a multiplex, for example, and locate the screen that is showing the film you want to see. Subscribing to an RSS feed is like subscribing to a satellite TV channel. Your Skybox, or digibox, which you keep <em>at home</em>, of course, <em>aggregates</em> the channels you have subscribed to, each playing films on a particular theme. Each channel is like an RSS feed. You can choose which you subscribe to, and when. You can channel hop at your leisure. In the same way, users consume the RSS feeds they are subscribed to via a <em>single</em> application - either online (using a service such as <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> or <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>) or via a desktop client. Sky Movies sells convenience, <em>pushes</em> content to me. RSS is another <em>push</em> medium.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The second, key feature of RSS feeds are that they provide a way of <em>syndicating</em> content. Syndication is well known across the media, from print to radio. Many cartoonists, photographers, and local newspapers survive by syndicating their content - republishing it unchanged - to other outlets, typically for financial gain. RSS feeds allow publishers to <em>syndicate</em> their web content so that it can be republished on other websites or be delivered, in an appropriate format, to a wide variety of mobile devices.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Offering content for syndication via RSS feeds offers several benefits. Firstly, users can publish the content on a personal site they visit regularly, such as personal homepage or 'webtop', such as <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personal Pages</a>, <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>, or <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>. Secondly, the content may be published on other peoples' websites, providing more opportunities for users to come across it. Thirdly, content published on a third party website can provide <em>links back to the original publisher's site</em>, driving traffic onto their own web properties.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>As well as syndicating content, RSS feeds can be used as transport mechanism for moving collections of weblinks from an originating source, such as a database, and allowing them to be republished elsewhere. In the Open University, the OU Library is exploring the use of this technique as a way of surfacing links from their <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk">ROUTES</a> database and <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> collections within the <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/courses">Moodle VLE</a>. You can see many more examples of how RSS feeds can be used to pipe content into Moodle in this <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">demo Moodle course</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Valuable, topic related links, as well as media assets such as videos, interactive flash movies, images or audio files, can be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">mined</a> from within the body of a course unit and published via static RSS feeds, atomising the course into high value component parts; courses can also be <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010236.html">bundled from RSS component feeds</a>. The media enhanced RSS feeds can then be published via online do-it-yourself media channels, such as <a href="http://spashcastmedia.com">SplashCast</a>. Like youTube, these services offer media players which may be embedded in third party or personal websites, or indeed elsewhere within the original publisher's own site, as taster, teaser, refresher or revision items.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Collections of weblinks mined from course materials can be passed via RSS feeds to users' browsers, where they can operate as course provided bookmarks. These static, link collection RSS feeds can also be used to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010193.html">limit web searches</a> via custom search engines so that the search is only made over the websites that are linked to from the original course.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Late last year, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7. Like many modern browsers, such as Firefox, Opera or Safari, IE 7 is geared up for RSS feeds. Not only is it capable of <em>RSS feed autodiscovery</em> - recognising when a web page publisher has declared within a web page that an RSS feed for that web page, or website, is available - it is also capable of subscribing to, and displaying, RSS feeds. Furthermore, installing IE7 on Windows XP systems also installs the  <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686418.aspx">Windows RSS (Common Feed List) Platform</a>, which is also an integral part of the Windows Vista operating system. This platform provides the subscription to RSS feeds at the level of the operating system, with the result that when one application (such as IE7) is used to subscribe to a feed, that feed is also made available to other applications via the platform. Subscribe once, reuse everywhere - at least as far as desktop applications go. The full implications of the common feed platform have barely been touched on yet. Under the most optimistic view, shipping the common feed platform with Vista could be as significant an event as when Windows first starting shipping with the Internet Explorer browser.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p><em>The future is bright. The future is orange.</em> <img alt="feed-icon-64x64.gif" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feed-icon-64x64.gif" width="64" height="64" border="0" /></p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Visit the website of any media outfit and it is likely that you will see the orange feed icon somewhere on the site. Web 2.0 blogger <a href="http://www.currybet.net/">Martin Belam</a> has recently published a series of blog posts analysing <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/currybet/~3/113551110/guardian.php">how "web 2.0" the websites are of the UK national daily newspapers</a>, a critique that features prominently the ability to subscribe to content via RSS web feeds. The BBC has published up a wide variety of RSS feeds, many of which are used in <em>web 2.0 mashups</em> developed by (public) members of the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/">BBC Backstage community</a>. The Guardian newspaper's <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/">Technology Guardian</a> website leads the way on innovative reporting in the print sector.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The BBC also uses RSS feeds  - as do thousands of others - to publish <em>podcasts</em>. Publishing an audio file on a website does not make it a podcast. A podcast is something you subscribe to. A podcast is an RSS feed with audio file enclosures.<br />
 <br />
<em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>In the same way that an audio file online is not a podcast, an online journal entry is not necessarily a <em>blog</em>. For me, a blog is something you can subscribe to. A blog is an RSS feed that contains predominantly text entries. Yes, the blog may have the public face of a website. But at its heart, it is nothing if you cannot subscribe to it. A blog is as nothing without a corresponding RSS feed. It is just another website.<br />
 <br />
<em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>To a certain extent, RSS is becoming a universal data transport mechanism. As well as transporting links and content, RSS feeds can also move data between websites. Many online calendars publish RSS feeds containing the dates of past, present and future events, and online calendars can in turn be used to <a href="http://30boxes.com/boxed">display the contents of an RSS feed in a calendar</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>GeoRSS feeds can transport geographical data directly into online maps, such as <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/03/kml-and-georss-support-added-to-google.html">Google Maps</a> or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/georss/index.html">Yahoo! maps</a>. The same RSS feed could even be used to pipe data into <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html">calendar and map displays at the same time</a>. </p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>RSS feeds can be merged, combined, sorted and filtered. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a> provides a graphical interface for building feed processing applications, lowering the barriers to entry to for developers keen to build RSS feed powered mashups - applications that use data from an online service (or data mixed together from several different online web services) and display it via other third party web services.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Many search engines make the results of a particular search available via an RSS feed that a user can subscribe to. Subscribing to the RSS feed of a persistent search (also known as a saved search) means that the user will be notified whenever the search engine discovers a new result for that search. Subscribing to the RSS feed essentially provides the user with an alerting service defined by the terms of the saved search.</p>

<p><em>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to revolutionise the way we syndicate content throughout our internal publishing systems is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to expose and syndicate asset collections generated by mining our courses for those assets is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Blatantly disregarding the potential for using RSS feeds to revolutionise the way we make content available to our students so that they can study it <em>where they want it</em> and <em>when they want it</em> is a risky strategy.</p>

<p>Laughing off RSS feeds as a technology that we don't understand is not an option.</p>

<p><strong>We ignore RSS at OUr peril.</strong></p>

<p><hr /><br />
PS I've never written a manifesto before... which is what this is, I guess... sort of... in reverse, maybe... ;-)<br />
PPS Thanks to John Naughton for suggesting a few tweaks to an earlier version of this post.</p>

<p>Picking up on a couple of points raised in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010211.html">An MIT OpenCourseWare Course via an OPML Feed</a>, I've atomised the MIT OpenCourse Course <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Comparative-Media-Studies/CMS-610Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">CMS.610 / CMS.922 Media Industries and Systems, Spring 2006</a>  a little further and replaced some of the OPML items with RSS feeds.</p>

<p>In particular, I've replaced the list of video games with a feed containing those items pulled from an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/MITOCW-CMS610-Games/lm/R2356SXQHQ8XBJ/">Amazon Listmania list</a> via a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">third party Listmania2RSS service</a> (which I've used before in a similar context: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009154.html">OpenLearn/OCW Reading Lists</a>).</p>

<p>I've also created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1751CECCEFC5615C">youTube channel</a> with trailers/reviews of some of the example video games mentioned in the course. Applying the bookmarklet mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">Grazring YouTube Favourites Playlists</a> to the youTube channel page creates a static snapshot (i.e. not live:-( RSS feed of the playlist, which can also be mixed into the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">course OPML</a> (or <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?addbar=on&view=3p&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mitocwplayground/mitocwDemo2.opml">view the course via grazr</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="mitocwdemo2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mitocwdemo2.png" width="794" height="579" border="0" /></p>

<p>Finally, I added another Listmania list, this time for the books cited in the course.</p>

<p>..and as an afterthought, a link to a delicious feed pointing to a list of bookmarks of the books on the reading list that appear in Google Books. [Latency on replicating bookmarks across the delicious servers is really becoming an issue, methinks?]</p>

<p>Whilst I haven't done this (yet!), it's trivial to pipe the Listmania lists into an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">online shop</a>, courtesy of something like Amazon aStores.</p>

<p>This incremental disaggregation approach (?!) is a route I'm keen on exploring further as a way of identifying patterns that can be used <em>in reverse</em> as <a href="http://blogs.learningparty.net/brian/2007/04/25/just-try-it-mister/">exemplar mashup strategies</a>, by aggregating content from reusable raw components, rather than disaggregating it into reusable component parts.</p>

<p>The disaggregation step does, however, have the beneficial side effect  of producing reusable components from effectively closed (i.e. not trivially mashable or remixable) open content ;-)</p>

<p>PS for another take on educational mashup activity, check out the <a href="http://openconnectedsocial.learningparty.net/wiki/page/Mashups">Open, Connected, and Social: mashups</a> wiki page.</p>

<p>PPS for a more recent take on opencourseware OPML feed bundles, check out <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012453.html">MIT open courseware for High Schools feeds</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012487.html">Yale OpenCourseware Feeds</a>. Both these posts use Yahoo pipes to scrape ocw sites and automatically produce OPML feed bundles for the listed courses.

<p>Okay folks, I'm gonna have to trust you to be nice with this one, because every time you play with, it hits someone else's server...</p>

<p>What is it? My first attempt at an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnProcessor.php">OpenLearn XML Processor</a> "solution", that's what...</p>

<p>Now before Stephen Downes hollers about the server hits (;-) this is a proof of concept thing, okay? A demo. To act as something I can pick apart in front of people to try and show them how it's put together...</p>

<p>So what's it do?</p>

<p>Well - put in the URL to an OpenLearn XML file (you can host them on your own server after downloading them from <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a>, which requires you to register for the course and blah de blah de blah...) - or just stick in the unit code to one of the files I've alredy liberated - and the processor will (if it's working ;-):<br />
<ul><li>generate a link to a URL that uses a script to generate an OPML file that lists the media assets contained in the unit (L120_1 is a good demo of this (as reported previously in this post on  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">OpenLearn Asset Stripping</a>); a link to a Grazr view of the file is also generated;</li><br />
<li>generate a link to an RSS version of the course unit (as well as a link to a Grazr previewer); the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearn2rss.xsl">stylesheet</a> is still a bit ropey, but it's good enough for (some) demos; I'm having all sorts of problems with the character set, so if someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, that'd be much appreciated (it's something I've never really looked at).  The translation works by passing the XML file URL to a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=0F8Z_y7d2xGkWV9fnkartA">Yahoo pipe</a> that runs the XML through the W3C XML processor using the previously mentioned style sheet to generate the RSS output;</li><br />
<li>generate a link to a PDF version of the unit. This is achieved by plugging the URL for the OUXML2RSS Yahoo pipe (which has the  course XML URL as an argument, of course) into the <a href="http://www.rss2pdf.org">RSS2PDF.org</a> web service. The steps to generate the PDF, then, are: provide the URL of the XML, use a Yahoo pipe to send this to the W3C XSL processor with an appropriate style file, take the resulting RSS output from the Yahoo pipe and shove it into rss2pdf; (it should then be possible to pass this to a pdf2audio service, etc;-);</li><br />
<li>wire the live created RSS file into my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009972.html">serialised feeds service</a>. This service takes the serialised feed delivery configuration information provided via a web form, and uses that information - along with the current  time stamp - to work out how many items to deliver to the user. The service passes this required item count, along with a URL to the unit XML file to the Yahoo OUXML2RSS pipe that runs the XML through the W3C XSL processor along with a supplied XSL file), and then passes <em>this</em> generated feed to a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=XPfTMuTP2xGUL12c3C7BQA">feed serialiser pipe</a> (which is nothing of the sort really - all it does it count out a required nubner of feed items). Simple. :-) and stupid - because the W3C processor has to run every time the feed is polled.</li></ul></p>

<p>Okay - so maybe I need to work on the delivery of that explanation a little... and draw some pictures;-)</p>

<p>Or maybe write it up using the new draft proposal for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc: An XML Pipeline Language</a>. Because as I'm sure you all know, "[a]n XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be performed on one or more XML documents, producing one or more XML documents as output."</p>

<p>Also when I get a chance, I'll write an OpenLearn RSS Exploiter that uses a pre-generated/saved version of the RSS files to play around with the RSS (converting it to PDFs, audio, etc., as well as providing badges to one-click it into Netvibes, Google Personal, etc.).</p>

<p>But not today - I need to pack - going away for a week (so there'll be no posts for a bit...)...</p>

<!--
<p>In the beginning, OU courses were backed up television broadcasts that aired in the early hours of the morning on BBC2, and occasionally on Saturday mornings. More recently, course videos have been delivered on video cassette and DVD, with OU/BBC programming focussing more and more on prime time offerings (as you'll know if you've visited the OU/BBC <a hred="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> website</a> recently; for a full listing of OU broadcasts over the years, check out the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006117.html">BBC programme catalogue</a>).</p>

<p>One of the great strengths of OU broadcasts was that they were universally accessible. I'm not sure - historically - how useful students on our courses found the original broadcasts, but they are fondly remembered by a huuuuuuuuge number of people, and provide a great source of inspiration for comedy sketch show writers. For example, spot the spoof OU programme clip from these three (three embedded YouTube videos follow: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEFd4tCWtvk">option a</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COsIDP1fY90">option b</a> or  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISaL5HFzEMo">option c</a>;-): </p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PEFd4tCWtvk"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PEFd4tCWtvk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object> <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/COsIDP1fY90"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/COsIDP1fY90" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>  <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ISaL5HFzEMo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ISaL5HFzEMo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Did you manage to spot the spoof? Anyway anyway, these are quite a contrast to the latest offerings, such as the BAFTA winning <a href="http://www.open2.net/coast/coast2006series.html">Coast</a> series or the brilliant <a href="http://www.open2.net/marksteel/index.html">Mark Steel lectures</a>.</p>

<p>What prompted this post though, was a webflyer I saw today for an <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/036718.php">online educational video competition</a>. My immediate thought was: do we have anything we could submit? If so, what? And if not, why not?</p>

<p>The competition in and of itself is not what got me thinking...</p>

<p>Rather, it was the suggestion that the 30 second to 2 minute short is perhaps starting to come of age - just the sort of content that <em>can</em> appear on YouTube (via the web, or - from June - via <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/03/27/mobile-youtube/">YouTube Mobile</a>) and communicate some useful educational content on demand to the user, or embedded in some course material.</p>

<p>We were so nearly in a position to steal a lead on this sort of content packaging. I remember being at an OU/BBC broadcast meeting several years ago when 'filler' programming - 30s clips to go in-between scheduled broadcasts - was mooted (rather than the extended idents and BBC ads that take up 2-3 minutes of screen time between programmes nowadays). that was pre-blogtime for me, though, so I don't have any records other than a vague memory of that meeting... and no links to examples either...:-)</p>

<p>Anyway - if internal readers know of any shorts that can be showcased in public, feel free to pass me a link... ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">BBC Radio Listen Again: Feeding Grazr Embedded Real Audio</h3>

<!--
<p>For some time, Grazr has been able to play MP3 files embedded in RSS feeds, as well as YouTube videos (e.g. using this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009897.html">YouTube feed generator</a> to feed in the videos). Now, they also support the playing of streamed Real Audio (<em>if</em> you have a Real Audio plugin installed in your browser, that is...).</p>

<p>This is interesting to me (and the reason I was hassling Mike@Grazr for it (thanks Mike!:-)) because the BBC currently make a large amount of their archived radio programmes available using this format. (Check out the <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=av&q=computer+security">BBC A/V Search</a> for example (it would be good if you could define audio or video search limits, methinks?)).</p>

<p>At the moment Grazr needs the ram file to be linked to as a feed enclosure. The Beeb doesn't offer this as a service, I don't think, (and I hope I'm not breaking too many T&C?!) but here's a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/embedRATest.xml">demo feed</a> and here it is <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/test/embedRATest.xml">in a Grazr widget</a>. For the files to play, you'll need to have a Real Audio plugin installed in your browser.</p>

<p>To show how we might make use of this, I've started stringling resources together around the recent Click On radio programmes and included the Click On listen again feed in the mix: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On Stringle Demo</a>.</p>

<p>Having just posted a link to <a href="http://spashcast.net">Spashcast.net</a>, and idled about whether it would be an interesting way of delivering learning content, I thought I better do a quick demo to see how it feels.</p>

<p>So here's a v v quick, rough and ready demo, cobbled together from scraps of content taken from an OpenLearn language course:</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/p/FDAQ2842MC" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></p>

<p>The feeling is very much of a slideshow with slides corresponding to textual, audio or video content (the images don't seem to be working for me at the moment).</p>

<p>When I get a chance I will try to put a proper demo together, maybe including the Splashcast content as the homepage for a Stringle app?</p>

<p>Just in passing, on the topic of educational content packages pulled together from open content material, it's worth checking out this post on <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/312">Educational Remixes</a>...</p>

<!--
<p>... or should that be <em>Web tvOU</em> (<em>tee - voo</em>? <em>tee - vo - you</em> (though that's a bit <em>too</em> like <a href="http://tivo.com">TiVo</a> maybe?)).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.currybet.net/">Martin Belam/currybet dot net</a> posted last week about the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/currybet/~3/98356959/playing_with_the_virgin_radio.php">Virgin Radio Player Beta</a> (we're still waiting for the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/askbruce/articles/bbc.co.uk/imp_1.shtml">BBC Player</a> too, of course):<br />
<blockquote>Apart from having the streaming area and radio controls, the player features content areas as well. There is an encouragement to interact with the show on air via email, text and the telephone. It also offers integrated music news headlines, and the opportunity to watch videos as well - yet another example of the internet enabling radio and radio stations to break out of their spectrum scarcity driven audio-only constraints.</blockquote></p>

<p>The reason I think the Virgin player is worth watching is in part because of the <em>other</em> <a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/">Virgin Media</a> play at the moment that is focusing on the four way phone/mobile/broadband/TV approach. As I understand it, Virgin Radio is independent of the Virgin Media group, but the cross-branding opportunities surely must be there? </p>

<p>In a similar vein to the Virgin radio player, I also just discovered a rather neat <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/radio_podcasts/bbclistenagain.html">BBC Listen Again</a> Dashboard widget*. This widget scrapes BBC 'listen again' pages and then provides links to the streamed audio. After clicking on a program link, the audio stream is played via an embedded Real Audio player.</p>

<p><img alt="listenAgainWidget.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/listenAgainWidget.png" width="309" height="343" border="0" /></p>

<p>[* Hmm - are there any dashboard2google widget converters out there? Or do the current batch of converters like <a href="http://amnesty.mesadynamics.com/Products.html">Amnesty converter</a> just port stuff <em>into</em> the OS/X Dashboard? The Dashboard increasingly seems like a sink for widgets from other platforms... which is actually a :-(, IMHO]</p>

<p>The 'BBC Listen Again' widget is particularly interesting from an OU perspective because of the large number of co-productions with the BBC that we have been  - and continue to be - involved with. For whatever reason, simple (one-click) <em>listen again</em> links to co-pro broadcasts do not tend to be provided from the Open2.net site though, although with a little mashery (as demonstrated by the BBC Listen Again widget) this is easily rectified...;-)</p>

<p>When I first saw the BBC Listen Again widget, my first thought was 'excellent - we can use this to deliver a set of links to a series of programmes that could add value to an OU course directly to a student's desktop'; secondly, that we could distribute 'promotional widgets' containing samples of different OU/BBC programmes to <em>potential</em> students, as well as to the broader categories of informal, self-motivated learners and general interest audiences; thirdly, that BBC programme bundles could be provided to add value to/augment OpenLearn course units; and finally, that maybe we could start one or more subject (faculty?) related OU channels delivered via customised widgets.</p>

<p>Whether or not the BBC would be <em>happy</em> for this sort of reuse (or at least, this form of republication of links to publicly available content) is moot. For example, all six programmes from the recently broadcast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/clickon/">Click On</a> series are currently available as 'listen again' content. However, the links are <em>not</em> made available in a simple machine readable format, such as RSS (for that, you have to look here: <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/clickon+ram">Listen Again to <em>Click On</em></a>), which maybe suggests that the Beeb want people to access the content only via the programme web page?</p>

<p>Anyway, I've started tinkering with the Listen Again widget so that it can consume RSS feeds and extract programme info/links from them. When I get it working, this means I'll be able to use delicious, for example, to compile BBC playlists for playing through the widget. (The availability of the feed also means it will be trivial to access the content in <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">Stringle</a> if (when...?!) the Grazr folks get Real Audio player embedding sorted out!;-)</p>

<p>On the topic of custom channels, I guess I should also mention here last week's announcement of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6411017.stm">BBC and YouTube Deal</a> which will see three BBC channels appear on YouTube:<br />
<ul><li><em>BBC</em> - an advertising free (at least, free of non-BBC ads!) entertainment channel featuring programme trailers and added-value shorts for prime BBC broadcasts;</li><li><em>BBC Worldwide</em> - advertising supported self-contained shorts (3-6 minutes long) based on BBC archival material;</li><li><em>BBC News</em> - a news channel featuring 30 or so news clips per day. [This immediately brings to mind <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/index.cfm?id=163">Stefan Ruger</a>'s <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/anses/">ANSES - Automatic News Summarization and Extraction System</a> and <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/newsroom/">Newsroom - recording, segmenting and indexing news for you to browse, search, find, read, listen and watch</a> projects currently underway in KMi at the moment. (I really need to do a crit of these projects in the possible context of OU archival material...)]</li></ul></p>

<p>Discussions on how to use BBC/OU content in the context of OpenLearn, as well as more generally in the context of the OU's broadcasting strategy, are whizzing around here at the moment and are looking at issues closely related to the above.</p>

<p>I know one or two people in the OU who are keen to see us getting out legacy content out there even more aggressively than we already are with OpenLearn, so it'll be interesting to see if we pick up on the BBC's lead and start to explore the possiblitiy of an OU YouTube channel, in the same way that we presumably followed the BBC lead in signing up to the <a href="http://open2.net/creativearchive">Creative Archive project</a>.</p>

<p>In the same breath, it maybe also be worth our while considering launching an audio channel on <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/products/ipod/itunes_u.html">iTunesU</a> (the BBC already has channels on iTunes - for example, and several US educational institutions have iTunes U channels).</p>

<p><img alt="itunesBBC.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/itunesBBC.jpg" width="605" height="538" border="0" /></p>

<p>And then of course are the plethora of free digital channels, whether delivered by satellite and/or cable, as well (increasingly) free and subscription on-demand broadband video delivery systems; I now have two broadband on-demand video services installed on my laptop, for example: the free (?) <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> (I got my beta invite last week :-) and the largely pay-on-demand based <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4od/">4od</a>.</p>

<p>What is, I think, hard to understand is why the OU - the original 'University of the Air' (and arguably the UK's 'public service educator'?!), with its significant archive of broadcast (and not quite broadcast) quality content, is not <em>obviously</em> making forays into these new areas of online broadcast, and if anything is lagging behind the more adventurous institutions in the sector.</p>

<p>Rights issues act against us, I suppose - I'd imagine that the original rights negotiations did not anticipate the emergence of the web and open content licensing.</p>

<p>On the matter of channels, one of the interesting questions that I think the OpenLearn project has posed is what sort of environment or delivery channel is appropriate for the delivery of open content licensed educational materials to informal and semi-formal learners.</p>

<p>Looking at Martin Belam's review of the Virgin Radio Player, as well as the more limited audio specific offerings of the Listen Again widget, I wonder what sort of role the widget approach can play as part of a <em>platform</em> for the ongoing delivery of subject/topic specific <em>learning channels</em> as well as a self-contained one-shot content giveaways?</p>

<p>In the OpenLearn context, an email thread on related matters with <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/sbs/">Simon Buckingham Shum</a> led to him coining (to my hearing at least) the idea of <em>learning widgets</em>.</p>

<p>Although the nature of <em>learning widgets</em> was not really explored at the time, they could perhaps be thought of as micro-courses bundled up in a multimedia serving widget - like a self-contained <em>content widgetLE</em>, perhaps?!</p>

<p>(As an aside to the thread, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc Eisenstadt</a> suggested I might try to develop a role as a <em>learning widget evangelist</em> (cf. the role of <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/01/jobs_at_amazon_.html">technology evangelist</a>), which also appeals!;-)</p>

<p>To get an idea of how a multimedia learning widget might work, consider <a href="http://splashcast.net">SplashCast</a>. Splashcast allows you to create - and deliver - multimedia programmes via a browser widget. Here's one, for example, from TEDTalks (you'll probably need to visit the actual blog post page to see this - it's unlikely to be displayed in a feed reader):</p>

<p><embed src=http://web.splashcast.net/go/p/AKAA1172DK" wmode="Transparent" width="400" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></p>

<p>There's a broadcast review meeting on at the OU next week. I wonder if anyone will bring up Splashcast? ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>A week or two ago I posted about the possibility of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009726.html">Search Powered Predictions</a> in which I idled about whether might be able to make use of users' search behaviour to try and predict potentially popular new courses.</p>

<p>Today, I came across <a href="http://www.spotplex.com/">Spotplex</a>, which "provides internet users with real-time ranking of blog articles based on actual impression count".</p>

<p>Apparently, it works like this:<br />
<blockquote>1. A blogger inserts a Spotplex code into their blog.<br />
2. Whenever an article in the blog is read, the code reports Spotplex server that the article is read.<br />
3. The article shows up on Spotplex and the view counter reflects the change.</blockquote></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be good if we had an internal version of this running for course pages listed in the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/">OU Course catalogue</a>?</p>

<p>Or how about using page reads as implicit votes in a prediction market for the number of students likely to register on a particular course...</p>

<p>...because apparently students are leaving it later and later to register on our courses (I wonder if they are holding out for sale prices on the course fees? Although I guess if they're Tesco punters they could always use <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009219.html">Tesco Clubcard vouchers as part payment for their OU course fees</a>?</p>

<p>With the post of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2902">Director, Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a> currently being advertised (<em>Salary negotiable</em>, apparently), I wonder just how different things would be internally if a 2.0 type was appointed?<br />
<blockquote>Employing 490 editors, graphic designers, web designers, audio-visual specialists and software developers, our Learning and Teaching Solutions is responsible for the production and delivery of all our learning materials. Under your direction, the unit will bring to life the creations of our academic specialists, delivering world class print material, CD ROMs, DVDs and web pages, plus cutting-edge Blogs, Wikis, ePortfolios and eAssessment engines to power our Virtual Learning Environment. This will involve constant liaison with academic Faculties and Schools, the Student Services division, the Library and our research institutes to keep us at the forefront of best practice.</p>

<p>To take on this exceptionally influential role, you will require considerable experience of producing distance learning media and deep understanding of new and evolving educational technologies. Joining us at a time of profound change, you will apply your imagination and expertise to shape the educational experiences of thousands of students around the world â€“ and build on our unrivalled reputation.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, the above is nothing to do with me (even more so than usual given the relative seniority of the post), but if you do apply etc etc <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009723.html">normal rules apply</a> (except - as a finders fee - I'd also like 10% of the negotiated salary to buy me a developer for a week or two of agile development time (?!) ... ;-0)</p>

<p>Clearing out my laptop bag this afternoon on my way back from an HE Academy event at <a href="http://local.live.com/?v=2&cid=250F429081C5ABBB!466">Microsoft in London</a> (where I took great pleasure in: a) using my Mac; and b) watching a Vista laptop repeatedly fail to play a Flash movie/crash IE7 ;-), I came across an old (Sept-Oct, 2006) and unread edition of Open House, the OU staff newspaper. There were a couple of things in there that particularly caught my attention (over and above the VC's letter where she praised residential schools, which it's worth pointing are now few and far between...)</p>

<p>First off, a short article mentioning the appointment of a strategic search manager (Vicki Stirling) who was appointed to "oversee web performance figures using tracking software", as well as [paraphrasing] "giving serious attention to listings in search engines such as Google".</p>

<p>Secondly, an article called "Thinking outside the box", which I shall repeat here in full:<br />
<blockquote>HOW will we decide what courses to offer in future? How can we keep abreast of market trends and look for potential opportunities?<br />
Traditionally, the OU has used data from HESA, the Higher Education Statistics Agency, which gives information on market size and competitors. But this has its limitations and only offers statistics on the HE market.<br />
To get a greater understanding of popular trends and areas of growing interest, the product marketing team has subscribed to two new research sources. BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board) collects and analyses data from UK TV audiences; and Nielsen BookScan [which] tracks over 90 per cent of retail and internet book sales in the UK, analysing buying trends and subject categories.<br />
Aready we have data that confirms our analysis that some traditional subject areas are in popular decline; but other subjects such as criminolgy, parenting and genealogy are growing in popularity. We'll be using this data to help the university look at developments for its curriculum for the future.</blockquote></p>

<p>Good stuff, eh? Sept-Oct 2006, that was.</p>

<p>Last month I gave a talk (mentioned in this post: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009231.html">Embracing Hype</a>) on the topic of 'Harnessing the Future', in which I idled on various technologies that are on the up, and mentioned some of data the sources we could tap into to try and help us identify upcoming curriculum areas.</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=19968&doc=harnessing-new-technologies-1592" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=19968&doc=harnessing-new-technologies-1592" /></object></p>

<p>In particular, information on search terms used by visitors on search engines that led them to the OU site; and Nielsen BookScan data (as visualised by O'Reilly Research).</p>

<p>BOTH of these sources of information were new to pretty much everyone in attendance (academic representatives of several Technology departments as well as the Computing department).</p>

<p>Now bear in mind that one of the points of the meeting that day was to try and identify future curriculum areas; and that many of the people in attendance were/are active in developing our curricula/degree programmes, as well as individual courses.</p>

<p><em>HOW will we decide what courses to offer in future? How can we keep abreast of market trends and look for potential opportunities?</em></p>

<p>You tell me... Right hand, meet left hand. Left hand, go figure...</p>

<h3 class="title">Search Powered Predictions</h3>

Something I've only really noticed over the last couple of years is how difficult many people find it to 'have ideas', whereas I spend all my time trying not to get sidetracked with chasing harebrained 'how about this...' schemes... Maybe...
<!--
<p>Something I've only really noticed over the last couple of years is how difficult many people find it to 'have ideas', whereas I spend all my time trying <em>not</em> to get sidetracked with chasing harebrained 'how about this...' schemes... Maybe it's because I used to spend my days a child reading books by Edward de Bono and Tony Buzan?</p>

<p>Whatever...</p>

<p>A couple of the techniques I use more or less unconsciously are 'idea accelerators' and 'idea collider' (think: particle accelerators ;-)</p>

<p>The <em>idea accelerator</em> (or <em>meme accelerator</em>) is related to <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> - take an idea and run with it as far and as fast as you can (the important thing is to keep momentum up). This is a bit like a longitudinal brainstorm, where you just have to keep pushing a meme forward, rather than bringing in completely new ideas.</p>

<p>The <em>idea collider</em> (or <em>meme collider</em>) just requires you place two ideas/techniques/applications together (I try to hold them in the same breath...) and see what comes of them. Cross-fertilisation of ideas, sort of...</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, there are some things that have been clunking around in my mind for some time that are just begging to be fused in some way, but I haven't been able to make time to think them through at all, let alone completely. So I'm hoping that by posting the germ here, I'll commit some dog walking/commute thinking time to the matter as a result...</p>

<p>The trigger for the post, by the way, is the <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/">Dell Idea Storm</a>, a <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> like clone where users can "submit ideas for a new Dell product or service" and then vote on each other's ideas <em>a la</em> Digg. [I need to sort out an accented font, don't I?]</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - the germ of the collision is this: take one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction market</a> framework (something like <a href="http://betocracy.com/">Betocracy</a> for example), add possible successful course predictions in place of the bets and combine it with something like the <em>search engine referrers</em> stats from a web analytics package (like <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> for example) to feed automated bets into the system...</p>

<p>Ok, ok, the thinking is garbled, and I'm not totally sure how the prediction market bit would work, but the Digg/Dell Idea Storm model shows the way forward. In an OU 'what courses should we be providing?' sense, imagine something like the following:</p>

<p><em>Example 1</em>:<br />
<ol><li>Descriptions of potential courses are posted as 'stories';</li><li>students vote on the ones they like.</li></ol><br />
Result: potentially popular courses float to the top.</p>

<p><em>Example 2</em>:<br />
<ol><li>Descriptions of potential courses are posted as 'stories';</li><li>search terms used by students on the OU course catalogue are treated as votes that can be cast;</li><li>a vote is given to a story/proposed course if a search term that would lead to the story/proposed course is used on the course catalogue.</li></ol><br />
Result: predicted potentially popular courses float to the top.</p>

<p><em>Example 3</em><br />
As <em>Example 2</em>, except that votes are only cast if the proposed course would be returned as one of the top three (?) ranking results <em>if</em> it were included in a live/real search.<br />
Result: a more robust version of 2, assuming people only click through the top few hits!</p>

<p><em>Example 4</em><br />
As <em>Example 2</em>, except that votes are only counted if a student clicks through to request further materials (or even better, actually clicks through th <em>register</em>) on a real course after using search terms that would have turned up the proposed course (maybe as one of the top three (?) ranking results if you want to tighten things up further) <em>if</em> it were included in a live/real search.<br />
Result: predicted potentially popular courses that people might actually register on float to the top.</p>

<p>What I'm leading towards here is the idea of 'invisible vote casting' (predictive marketing?!) used to help identify courses that might appeal to students ont he basis of their course descriptions.</p>

<p>I suspect the approach could also be used as a basis of forecasting the number of students who might register on a proposed course (<em>search powered forecasting</em>!)?</p>

<p>I'm still not clear on how the prediction market variant would work though! ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">ePortfolios, Distributed Storage and Personal Repository Caches</h3>

<!--
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Chris Pegler mailed me asking if I had any ideas for a talk she was giving about technology enabled 'new learning activities' for adult learners over the next 2-3 years. The theme of the event was something to do with ePortfolios, which provides the context for the rest of this post. I'm not sure if the talk has been posted anywhere yet - or how it turned out - but the germ of the following came out of my ramblings at the time.</p>

<p>So here it is  - a ramble around possible futures relating to online storage and e-portfolios...</p>

<p>One of my favourite quotes is William Gibson's 'the future is already here; it's just not evenly distributed yet'. Predicting short term technology futures - like predicting the weather - is often safest if you take the line that 'the weather tomorrow will be like the weather today'. The problem is, that while day to day changes are barely noticeable, continual incremental changes can result in major changes. Rome may not have been built in a day, but it was built one brick (column(?!)) at a time.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest changes in technology enabled learning activities will, I think, arise from the mainstreaming of stuff that is already out there and helping people 'grok' how to use some of the 'new'  technologies.</p>

<p>To drive uptake, I think the users firstly need to see how they might gain personal benefit from new technologies <em>today</em>, in the context of how they already use related technologies.</p>

<p>An example here might be dragging a link from a web page or browser address line onto the browser bookmark toolbar, to encourage the use of bookmarking; and then showing how users who use <em>different</em> browsers might benefit from social bookmarks or bookmark synching.</p>

<p>Another example might be the use of online word processors such as <a href="http://docs.google.com">Writely/Google docs</a> or <a href="http://writer.zoho.com">Zoho Writer</a>: alternatives to applications that users already use that offer some benefits over those currently used tools.</p>

<p>As well as offering personally beneficial (more convenient?) alternatives to current tools, many web applications also support sharing and/or collaborative features. These features provide 'personal benefit <em>plus</em>' - enhanced personal benefits arising from either the network effects afforded by social technologies, or the collaborative models afforded by being able to share your content in ways you determine.</p>

<p>Giving users easy control over the access permissions assigned to their web-reachable content is becoming a widespread model in web applications and one that may lead to expectations from users with respect to: a) the features they expect from a portfolio; b) the ways in which they can collaborate with others - either in a commenting way, co-production of documents way etc.</p>

<p><em>How</em> users organise their content is also potentially "subject to change". If you know how to create folders/directories on a Windows machine (and I'm prepared to believe there are many users who <em>don't</em> know how to do this) then the odds are that you have a complex hierarchy of folders on your computer, with each file stored in a single location.</p>

<p>Increasingly, however, as users collect files and folders on their personal machine, I suspect that more and more of them (in unacknowledged deference to the Google way of working) <em>search</em> for content on their computer, rather than navigating/browsing to it via a folder hierarchy.</p>

<p><em>Search based navigation</em>  - or content rediscovery - will become increasingly common as desktop search becomes as fast as Google search (which is the case in Vista). How this will affect the way in which users mentally organise their content is unclear to me... ;-)</p>

<p>Search will also increasingly provide a loop back to flat directory based organisation by means of "active folders", directories that contain the contents of a live, saved search on particular search terms. (So for example, I could associate a saved search for 'desktop search' with a directory, and the contents of that directory will be the results of that search.) It will be interesting to see how widely adopted this becomes - it is already possible on some platforms (such as Mac OS/X) and I believe it is also supported in Vista.</p>

<p>Organisation using tagging schemes is also likely to benefit from increased support and user uptake, perhaps in tacit response to more and more widespread use of clustered search results (such as in search engines (like <a href="http://clusty.com">Clusty</a>) or online stores (think Amazon)).</p>

<p>As far as (online) storage goes in a personal as well as an educational setting - for this latter concern, think personal repositories or e-portfolios - I get the feeling that storage <em>per se</em> will not be the determining factor in the solutions that the users prefer. Just having online <em>storage</em> is all very well, but users will increasingly expect to have editors - as well as effective search tools - associated with each content type that can be stored in the repository - e.g. Zoho's recent announcements of integration first with <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/omnidrive-becomes-perfect-with-zoho/">Omnidrive</a> and then <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/boxnet-integrates-zoho/">box.net</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth considering how users will react to the continuing rise of cheap, affordable, or free <em>seemless</em> application related online storage. I'm thinking here of the free storage you get implicitly when you register for online applications. For example, Google Mail famously gives you over 2 gigabytes of storage, Zoho gives you free storage with its apps, and so on.</p>

<p>This is leading to a world where we each maintain <em><strong>distributed</strong> personal digital object repositories</em> locally organised around particular applications:<br />
<ul><li>word docs on Google docs/Zoho Writer;</li><br />
<li>photos on flickr;</li><br />
 <li>movies on motionbox etc.</li></ul></p>

<p>The desktop correlate here is akin to only ever accessing files from the 'recently opened' menu in an application, rather than launching hte application by first discovering the file...</p>

<p><h3>"Found repositories"</h3><br />
<blockquote>The term found art - more commonly found object (French: objet trouve</em>) or readymade - describes art created from the undisguised, but often modified, use of objects that are not normally considered art, often because they already have a mundane, utilitarian function.</blockquote> Ref: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_art">Wikipedia: <em>Found art</em></a></p>

<p>In some respects, the 'local application based storage' may be thought of as 'found storage' in the sense that it "describes storage provided implicitly by application providers that are not normally considered storage providers".</p>

<p>When content organisation tools (such as tagging) and additional application helpers are provided alongside the storage, we might even go so far as to argue that system offers enough functionality to be regarded as a 'found repository'.</p>

<p>Local storage contrasts with services like Omnidrive, which offer storage first and <em>then</em> editing tools as an additional service and services offered as a consequence of the wider commoditisation of online storage (I'm thinking of things like BT's <a href="http://www.btdigitalvault.bt.com/">Digital Vault</a> here). </p>

<p>And with an always on broadband connection, why not use online storage as your main drive - especially if it looks just like another drive on your PC (<a href="http://www.xdrive.com/access.jsp">XDrive</a>).</p>

<p>Another feature of online storage solutions is their "collaborative" nature, insofar as they typically let users define access privileges over stored items - which means you can share different documents stored in the same repository with different closed groups...</p>

<p>Whether users will prefer to go to a single storage place from where they access and edit files, or go to an app from where they open locally stored copies of the files they are working on, I don't know. Maybe there are reports out there that will shed light on how this might play out that compare the behaviour of users who go to My Docs and open a .doc file into Word, with users who open Word and navigate for 'recently used' files?</p>

<p>[Just by the by, it's worth bearing in mind that online services like Zoho Writer offer toolbar integration with Microsoft Word, as well as letting users open web links to .doc documents directly into the online applications.]</p>

<p>I'd also argue that the scope of the distributed/discovered repository goes even further than application related storage. In a very real sense, we are starting to see the emergence of <em>Personal Repository Caches</em> almost everywhere we look:<br />
<ul><li>digital PVRs (personal video recorders);</li><br />
<li>iPod/MP3 players (as well as caching subscription services, like iTunes);</li><br />
<li>digital media centres/home media hubs;</li><br />
<li>portable storage devices/USB drives etc.</li></ul></p>

<p>Finally, by opening up their APIs, storage companies and application providers can <em>both</em> play off each other's strengths. The recent publication of the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/notebook/gdata.html">Google Notebook API</a>, and the forthcoming <a href="http://www.zoho.com/notebook/">Zoho Notebook</a> (which will presumably also have an API if other Zoho apps are anything to go by) are likely to provide many opportunities for integrating online content capture and organisation tools with both online storage tools and online applications.</p>

<p>When compared to the rapid pace of development by small start-ups focusing on online storage, online apps, or the integration of the two, it's worth reflecting on the extent to which e-portfolio developers in the educational sector can keep up.</p>

<p>In a follow on to this post, I'll look at how search and discovery can be supported in this emerging world, such as using tags to help users organise and index content *across* distributed, found/discovered repositories.</p>

<p>Things I'll consider include the extent to which we'll need to help people organise their distributed repositories and whether we can help students articulate the skills they use to manage their stuff across multiple digital object stores to help them manage their own learning resources.</p>

<p>We also need to ask whether we can learn from some of our younger students (i.e. those who are well versed in the ways of the web) better ways of managing knowledge. In particular, how and why do users a) partition their stuff to support rediscovery, (e.g. separating holiday photos from birthday photos, or simply keeping different parts of their life separate (work/home)); b) reconcile stuff across different digital object stores (e.g. bank statements from different online banks, e.g. movies on motionbox and photos on flickr recording the same Christmas dinner).</p>

<p>I'll leave a consideration of the possible future of search as it relates both to search over personal resources and personalised search over arbitrary web resources - as well as a consideration of the extent to which a user's (search) history becomes part of their implicit/discovered/found repository - to another post...</p>

<h3 class="title">Let's Get Wiring - Yahoo Pipes</h3>

<p>So I assume everyone's seen THE most beautiful piece of poetry-in-motion digital storytelling that is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">Web 2.0  ... The Machine is Us/ing Us </a> movie?</p>

<p>Well the beautiful stuff just keeps on rolling.... welcome <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! pipes</a> (should'a been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtOoQFa5ug8">tubes</a> though... ;-)</p>

<p>(Ok - there's probably a way to go with the service yet, but there's a heck of a lot of playing can be done with what's there... as you'll see...)</p>

<p>In a nutshell <em>pipes</em> offers a visual feed wiring tool</em>; check out <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">Tim O'Reilly's ad for pipes</a> for the overview and below for my first quick foray...</p>

<p>A couple of weeks (?) ago, I posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009224.html">searching OpenLearn anywhere</a> by creating a "Dapp" to scrape <a href="http://www.dappit.com/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=OpenLearnSearch">OpenLearn Search Results</a>.</p>

<p>This application offers - among other things - an RSS feed of results from a search over <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> content. (OpenLearn doesn't offer this natively, of course, but the results are clean enough to scrape reliably, which is what things like <a href="http://www.dappit.com">Dapper</a> were invented for, right? Web service intermediation for people who don't do web services.)</p>

<p>I showed in the post how to use the dapp feed to create an OpenLearn/Grazr search widget using <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml">this bit of Grazrscript</a>. And here's how to use in <em>pipes</em> - an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/uHUU3Gq32xGtaUcNphr_og">OpenLearn search pipe</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="pipes1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipes1.png" width="894" height="513" border="0" /></p>

<p>As has been commented on elsewhere, this interface is very <a href="http://ning.com"><em>Ning</em>-like</a> - the pipe/application is both useable and cloneable - so you can clone (and then edit) someone else's pipe.</p>

<p>Ok, so that's what you see when you 'run' a pipe. Here's how you build it:</p>

<p><img alt="pipeOpenLearn.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeOpenLearn.png" width="666" height="478" border="0" /></p>

<p>The tool is quite easy to get to grips with, at least at this simple level. As you can see, the Dapp URL has several arguments. Although I typed this in, I soon realised you can just past a whole URL for a feed returning webservice into the URL box, and it will pull out the arguments for you (something I hope you'll soon be able to do with Grazr... although maybe there's no need now...?)</p>

<p>What I particularly like about this example is that it demonstrates how feed outputs from <em>different</em> web services can potentially be wired together...</p>

<p>Okay - so that's just one feed, being searched. It's trivial to add another - so I'll use the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006057.html">OU ROUTES search</a>, which does have an RSS output:</p>

<p><img alt="pipeOLandROUTES1" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeOLandROUTES1.png" width="1094" height="576" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's easy to merge feeds, limit them, sort them and so on (which I've yet to explore in anything other than cursory depth). In the above demo, I just take the first five items from each search and combine them in an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/uqZK1Wy32xGZLdgUt5qdmw">OpenLearn and ROUTES combined search</a> output feed.</p>

<p>The above shows how quickly feed wiring diagrams could get complicated, so rather than cloning and growing pipe applications, as I did in the above case, it's more advisable to reuse pre-existing pipes, if appropriate. So for example, I already had the OpenLearn Search pipe, so I can reuse it in a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/8lJH_G232xGBfqL5XqIxGw/">modified combined OpenLearn and ROUTES search pipe</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="pipeOLandROUTES2" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeOLandROUTES2.png" width="946" height="568" border="0" /></p>

<p>Of course, I could create a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/0lVSCHC32xGtUeAfphr_og/">ROUTES search pipe</a> and then just <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/yszyG3C32xG_P1Mgt5qdmw/">wire the ROUTES and the OpenLearn Search pipes together</a>...</p>

<p><img alt="pipeROUTES.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pipeROUTES.png" width="444" height="548" border="0" /></p>

<p>The pipes wiring interface is really easy to use, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun playing with it over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>The question is, how <em>ouseful</em> is wiring and filtering feeds likely to be for us and/or OUr students?</p>

<p>PS Pipes seems to be down at the mo - so I can't check to see if this works - but here's a guess at a <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=12pt&view=3p&file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openlearnROUTESgrazrSearch.opml">Grazr front end</a> to a the combined OpenLearn/ROUTES piped search described above... [was originally broken, now fixed; heh, heh - a Dapp fed pipe inside another pipe, with a user interface provided via a Grazr widget... Good stuff :-)</p>

<p>One of the slides I showed was a <a href="http://fplanque.net/Blog/Content/it/2006/gartner_hype_cycle_2006_large.jpg">pinched-from-the-web graphic</a> of the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475">Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle for 2006</a>.</p>

<p>What I like about this graphical device is that it can be used to illustrate stories. The story I'm working on may or may not have anything to with the Gartner interpretation of the curve, but it works for me. As a story. Sometimes.</p>

<p>Here's how it goes...possibly - I'll make it up as I go along:</p>

<blockquote>Once upon a time (note that once - it means once; it means this is a story) a technological breakthrough made all sorts of new and wonderful things possible.

<p>The geeks started to play, the technology was touted as being capable of solving all the world's problems and the media had a field day. The technology only half-worked, of course, but the early adopters were forgiving, partly because they could put up with a bug or two, partly because there were lots of new, low-hanging fruit applications of the technology appearing on a regular basis. And so people could play, and they could see that all the promised <em>really</em> wonderful things were only a matter of time away.</p>

<p>Word got out and the early-middle adopters started to come to the party. The technology still didn't work properly, and the users were not happy bunnies. Word got out again... but a different word this time. Not a nice word. A nasty word.</p>

<p>The techies continued working on the problems, resolving the usability issues, fixing the bugs. The apps came together, reliability improved, and people started using the new applications. Not loudly, quietly.</p>

<p>More people used the apps. And more. A few more each day. Have you tried this? they said to each other. </p>

<p>The apps started to be used. More than that, they started to be used every day. Just every day. You know - one of those things you <em>just</em> use every day. Because they do the job. Not like the first "you HAVE to try THIS" time around. More of "that? Yeah - we use that too" kind of way.</p>

<p>Clink (what's the sound of a light bulb going on?)</p>

<p>Hey guys - you seen this? I can see the headline already: "Technological breakthrough"</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - a couple of things about this. Firstly, I wonder about the 'fractal' (self-similar) nature of the Hype Cycle (does the model really work better if you think of it in terms of hype cycles on hype cycles?).</p>

<p>Secondly, I wonder whether or not hype cycle stories can be merged with disruptive technology tales? Does a disruptive technology curve start with a hype cycle whose peak of inflated expectations is the very first foray of the new technology into a market it may later disrupt?</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - that's off the point.... the point of the post, at least when I started to write it, was - is - to pose the question: </p>

<p>Whether or not you believe that the correctness of the Hype Cycle as a predictive device, a question I keep pondering is: given the timescales over which OU courses are: a) produced, and b) expected to survive, what technologies are the ones we should write about and expect to use within the courses?</p>

<p>That is, when we start looking for subject matter for future ICT courses and curricula, where on the most current hype cycle should we be looking for inspiration?</p>

<p>More on this another day...</p>

<!--
<p>For a long time, the <em>ouseful.open.ac.uk</em> index page has pointed to a web service that searches a database of OU course titles <em>and</em> the titles of books associated with a course in order to make course recommendations. I've been meaning to redesign the page to be more generally OUseful for some time, something that will actually happen over the coming weeks, I hope, but in the meantime I've set the page to redirect to a shared/public <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ouseful.ashx?page=6719564">Pageflakes</a> page:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5019518067218329602"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RajpFmw0MAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/6Iq7bxxNqLo/s800/ousefulPageflakes.png" /></a></p>

<p>I'm still working out what's the best content to put on the page - and may well need to write a few custom flakes to get the functionality I want - but my first attempt (shown above) contains a lot of what I wanted on the front page, if not in quite the style I had in mind.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are links to the major OUseful sites (this blog, the calendar, OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> and so on, some feeds (from the Feedburner feed of the blog, the calendar and my del.icio.us feedthru tag (so there will be some duplication of content with the blog feed, at times)), a notepad ('about' the contents of the page) and a message board (though I'm a bit twitchy about that...)</p>

<p>The page took maybe 20 minutes to pull together and represents a reasonable pattern, I think, for this sort of information page. Being shareable, I assume that - if you're a Pageflakes user - you'll be able to add it to your own Pageflakes profile.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take a look, here's a link: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that did strike me is that I can't get access to any stats from Pageflakes about how the page is being used. However, I did wonder if it would be possible to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008701.html">use Google Analytics to collect shared Pageflakes tab data</a>. I'll let you know how I get on with this...</p>

<p>PS May 2007 - the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful homepage</a> now has two further tabs: one that relays links from OU news and jobs RSS feeds, one that relays saved search  feeds about the OU from various news and social media websites.</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn on iPods?</h3>

<!--
<p>With lots of interest around the OU at the moment regarding 'Mobile Moodle', and how we take VLE content offline and into peoples' pockets, I was intrigued today when I stumbled across <a href="http://mogopop.com">mogopop</a>, a "web application designed to make it easy to create, publish and download multimedia content for iPods."</p>

<p>The premise is simple - create pages of content for your iPod, bundle it an go. As well as text pages, mogopop claims to let you incorporate audio, video and image pages in a particular bundle of pages (though with a 50MB size limit per project I suspect that will limit the amount of video you can include?)</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopProject.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopProject.jpg" width="865" height="589" border="0" /></p>

<p>As I had a spare hour or so this evening (that is, I needed a displacement activity away from marking...) I wondered how hard it would be to convert the <em>French: Ouverture</em> OpenLearn unit to a portable version...</p>

<p>The answer is rather trickier than I had at first anticipated, so much so in fact that I don't even have a demo of my own to link to :-( ... nor do I have an iPod, which means I wouldn't have been able to test it properly anyway. If anyone would like to donate one to me, please feel free to get in touch... ;-) Maybe you got a new one for Christmas...? Whatever... I can always <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/services/loanout.php">borrow an iPod from the OU Library</a>, if not...).</p>

<p>Text pages are easy enough to add:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopText.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopText.jpg" width="529" height="216" border="0" /></p>

<p>Audio uploads too seemed to work okay:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopAudio.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopAudio.jpg" width="523" height="197" border="0" /></p>

<p>The images uploaded fine, but I could never seem to save them into a page, though I could preview them:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopImage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopImage.jpg" width="259" height="198" border="0" /></p>

<p>I didn't succeed in uploading any video though - no matter what I tried (from following the mogopop iTunes conversion instructions, to using a variety of formats generated via the rather clever video converter utility <a href="http://heywatch.com/">Hey!Watch</a> (which will even convert files you have subscribed to via a feed :-).</p>

<p>(Thinking of that Hey!Watch feed subscription utility, it would be <em>really</em> handy if you could import a feed into mogopop and have it generate a correspondingly linked package as a result...)</p>

<p>There were significant other issues too with respect to making a (quick) sensible conversion of the actual learning materials:</p>

<p>- the large number of detailed images are actually too detailed (I suspect) for easy viewing on an iPod - and the activites wrapped around the images require you to actually inspect them quite closely;</p>

<p>- pulling a transcript out of the PDF transcript files to paste into a text page proved impossible (probably compounded by the fact that: a) I'm using Adobe Reader; b) on a Mac; c) the PDF text was very accented French, in d) a complex layout;</p>

<p>- several of the exercises are largely designed for <em>print</em> use (not even online use...), so are not really appropriate for use with a mobile screen.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough (I think) to put one of the heavier text based courses on into mogopop, but to my mind that largely defeats the purpose? Any comments?</p>

<p>Just in passing, OU readers interested in the <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/?page_id=30">VLE Mlearn project</a> can pick up an invite for three forthcoming workshops <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mlearninvite.doc">here</a>. The themes are:</p>

<p>- Podcasting, Course News and Alerts <br />
- Mobile Course Content <br />
- Social and User Generated Content on-the-move </p>

<p>Ah... Course News and Alerts.... that <a hre="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/">takes me back three or four years</a>... ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Driving home earlier this week, I wondered how useful it would be if Stringle - the string'n'glue learning environment - could support multiple tabbed panels. The problem of where to put the search box - and display the much larger search results page - was also bugging me.</p>

<p>The structure at the moment already separates out navigation (a Grazr widget), itinerant functionality (third party widgets, in the demo case provided via Widgetbox) and a web browsing area.</p>

<p>So just to try the look';n;feel'usability, here's a very rough cut - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">Stringle v2</a> that uses a tabbed area to provide two main display areas - one ('Web') for viewing any old web page (this is the panel that the navigation widget opens content into) and one ('Tools') that applications are loaded into.</p>

<p>Providing two tabs also made me realise that the <em>only</em> way of loading a page into the web content area was via the navigation panel. This seems a bit limiting, so I have added a URL address box so that you can open any page in that central area (which works unless the page being loaded insists on being at the top window level and not embedded in a frame):<br />
 <br />
<img alt="stringle5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle5.jpg" width="771" height="265" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment I have hardcoded topbar navigation links in to a search tool (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr">searchfeedr</a>), a chat tool (<a href="http://www.geesee.com/">Geesee</a>), a word processor/spreadsheet app (<a href="http://docs.google.com">Google docs</a> - though there is an issue that actual docs are opened into a new window...) and a drawing tool (<a href="http://gliffy.com">gliffy</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking on an application link in the topbar navigation area opens the application in the Tools panel:</p>

<p><img alt="stringle6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle6.jpg" width="738" height="271" border="0" /></p>

<p>If I get a chance, I'll try and tweak this so that a delicious feed can be used to pull in the topbar navigation links.</p>

<p>The styling is also a real mess, but tweaking stylesheets still takes me far longer that it should, so you'll just have to put up with the mess, I'm afraid...</p>

<h3 class="title">Annotating Local, Navigable Copies of OpenLearn Content</h3>

<!--
<p>Early this week I came across quite the most amazing Firefox extension I've seen for some time - <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/">Scrapbook</a>. This extension lets you make a local (i.e. offline) copy of a site, and then do various nifty things with it  - make personal annotations (or even shared ones if you have shared drive access), text highlighting, even search.</p>

<p>This extension particularly resonated with me when I came across it because earlier in the day we had been discussing at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120</a> course team meeting the frequently asked question about how long students retain access to course materials from our online courses. (Several weeks is the answer - then the material is no longer avialable).</p>

<p>There is also a not totally unrelated issue <em>at the moment</em> with <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> content, in the sense that the URLs for the current materials appear not to be very stable (though I have been told this is something that will be addressed in the near future...) - so while the content may stay up there, it may not be at the place you bookmarked...</p>

<p>Anyway - printing out online materials is one way of getting a persistent copy of onine materials, as is downloading them - although when pages can only be saved one at a time this can be quite a time consuming process.</p>

<p>So this is one area where Scrapbook caught my interest - the ability to download very easily all the pages from a course. So for example, we could go to the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1617">index page of an OpenLearn course</a>, which has links to all the course content pages from it, and use those links to download all the course information:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb1.jpg" width="577" height="596" border="0" /></p>

<p><em>A similar approach can be used for saving local copies of Technology short course pages: go to the course index page (that is, click on the Index tab , rather than Home tab) of a <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge course</a> and download in one go the course content pages linked to therefrom. Readers of this blog on any of these courses may wish to pass this info on via a course <s>conference</s> forum ;-)</em></p>

<p>Grabbing the index page - and the pages that are linked to from it - is easy: simply take the 'Capture Page As..' option from the Scrapbook menu:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb2.jpg" width="310" height="144" border="0" /></p>

<p>You now have to configure the download - take the links of depth  1:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb3.jpg" width="407" height="501" border="0" /></p>

<p>This gives you a list of <em>all</em> the pages that are linked to, which is way more than the ones you actually want:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb4.jpg" width="455" height="507" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are two ways of getting round this - one is to pause the download as soon as you can and just select the pages you want to download. One way of identifying which links those are is to hover over the links you want to download (or exclude) on the index page and make a note of the URL that should appear in the status bar at the bottom left corner of the browser window:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb5.jpg" width="423" height="107" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another way is to use the skip button to skip the download of the next link in the download list - there is a 3 second delay between downloads to give you time to make this decision for each link.</p>

<p> <img alt="olsb6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb6.jpg" width="425" height="110" border="0" /></p>

<p>For this 'Capture Page As...' download option., all the saved files are access via a single Scrapbook item, which you can find in the Scrapbook sidebar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb8.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb8.jpg" width="462" height="314" border="0" /></p>

<p>(It is also possible to save each page as separate Scrapbook items, although local navigation between the pages will not then be respected.)</p>

<p>If you select an item in the Scrapbook, you are taken to the local copy of that Scrapbook item. Two toolbars are then available at the bottom of the screen, that can be configured from the Scrapbook item right at the bottom of the browser window:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb9.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb9.jpg" width="199" height="177" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Edit toolbar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb10.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb10.jpg" width="444" height="29" border="0" /></p>

<p>And the Info toolbar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb11.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb11.jpg" width="405" height="28" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Info toolbar actually provides a sitemap to all the pages you downloaded:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb12.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb12.jpg" width="452" height="270" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is handy, because although the downloaded material has all the links localised, (so the navigation through the OpenLearn material is within your downloaded local copy of the material) the current OpenLearn navigation through materials is all but unusable (although <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008189.html">solutions are in principle available</a>).</p>

<p>The utility of the Scrapbook as a study support tool now moves up another gear. For example, you can highlight or annotate the saved content:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb13.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb13.jpg" width="287" height="127" border="0" /></p>

<p>Annotations can either be inline (and displayed via a popup tooltip) or floating 'post-it' type notes:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb15.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb15.jpg" width="181" height="46" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="olsb14.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb14.jpg" width="321" height="206" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another hand tool is the ability to search through the save content:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb16.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb16.jpg" width="706" height="538" border="0" /></p>

<p>More tools are available too -  the <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/files/ScrapbookTutorial-1.1.pdf">Scrapbook tutorial</a> is well worth a read, even if you don't get this extension, just so you know what you're missing out on.</p>

<p>One thing I liked in particular that I picked up from the tutorial was the add-on (yep - the Scrapbook extension can be extended with further add-ons - how neat is that? ;-) that allows you to back up your local, annotated, archived materials up to the <a href="http://box.net">box.net</a> online storage service (which I actually first got into through the <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/?source=2e583676-5fde-4234-ace8-861af6db4b3e">PageFlakes</a> webtop...).</p>

<p>If the new OU <em>MyStuff</em> ePortfolio supports an API, then it may be worth hacking together an extension for Scrapbook so that it can be used with that service.</p>

<p>(Of course, what I'd really like to see is MyStuff provide an option that would allow students to use the MyStuff interface with their own online storage service, so they could keep <em>their</em> content where <em>they</em> wanted.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the ultimate toy would be to add Scrapbook style bulk download functionality (and maybe the annotation and highlighting tools) to  <a href="http://www.zotero.org"">Zotero</a>, which provides more sophisticated collection management tools, as well as bibliographic reference tools?</p>

<h3 class="title">Stringle - Towards a String'n'Glue Learning Environment</h3>

<!--
<p>How easy is it to pull together a presentational learning environment, I wondered to myself last week? Very easy it turns out, in part becasue of the way the web is turning into a huge logical Lego set via web services, embeddable page widgets and web feed wiring.</p>

<p>Take this quick'n'dirty attempt, for example, that demonstrates how pre-existing <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007298.html">library related web feeds</a>,<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008208.html">RSS'ified OpenLearn content</a> and 3rd arty widgets can be pulled together into an almost integrated environment in a dozen lines of HTML - I call it <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle1.html">StrinGLE</a>, for string'n'glue learning environment:</p>

<p><img alt="stringle.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle.jpg" width="673" height="482" border="0" /></p>

<p>The environment has three panels:</p>

<p>- a sidebar navigation widget that feeds off an OPML file; when an actual HTML page web link is reached, it is opened in the main display area;<br />
- a sidebar <a href="http://widgetbox.com">Widgetbox</a> that can host one or more widgets  - or as I see it, <em>itinerant functionality</em> (and content) from other web sites;-)<br />
- a central main display area; in the screenshot above, I show a second embedded Grazr widget, this time displaying RSS'ified OpenLearn content, but it just as easily be a normal HTML page:</p>

<p><img alt="stringle2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle2.jpg" width="675" height="438" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that this is very much a first attempt, that I had held off posting for a few days in the hope of adding a few more features - bookmarking buttons, one click feed subscription and so on, each of them no more than a half-hour hack (except <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr">searchfeedr</a> integration, which may take a couple of hours...) - but spare half-hours are a scarce resource at the mo, so here's the very first Stringle as a placeholder and note to self to keep playing with this.</p>

<p>The second round of features should perhaps be integrated content editing tools, maybe something along the lines of Downes' <a href="http://www.downes.ca/editor/writr.htm">RSS writr</a> blogging tool.</p>

<p>Anyway, all to play for. All open source. All plug'n'play. All for free :-) Sort of....</p>

<p>I ran a training session hour this morning on social networking, giving a very rapid overview of a lot of sites that people have heard about, but never seen, let alone used.</p>

<p>As ever, I asked who in the audience of 20 or so who used things like MySpace, flickr, youTube and so on (none, two and one respectively, I think..)</p>

<p>Whenever I do a presentation like this the first time, I'm unsure as to what exactly I want  the take homes to be... (hmmm, what does that say about my preparation...?) Which is usually okay, because most presentations I put together end up being delivered two or three times, so I get to work on the things that came to mind during the first run through.</p>

<p>Anway, main take homes that ocurred to me that are not really covered in the presentation (which can be found, along with links, on this <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/103020">Social Networking Playlist</a>) include:<br />
<ol><li>In terms of development, and presumably reflecting the evolution of a  robust permissions structure, single/small team developer social sites frequently add functionality  in the following order: public sharing, private (i.e. no) sharing, group sharing.</li><br />
<li>Many social sites allow you to upload content, as long as you share it. If you want privacy, (and in particular, group privacy), you often have to pay for it (privacy is a privilege/paid for service, not a right...)</li><br />
<li>Some sites limit the amount of content you can upload on a free account. Heavy users need to pay for additional storage.</li><br />
<li>Many social sites grow virally - social networking (personal profile sharing) sites encourage users to invite their friends to join in the fun; collaborative content genearation sites require you to invite your collaborators to sign up in order that they can gain access to the document you want them to collaborate on.</li><br />
</ol></p>

<p>One other thing I need to bring into the presentation, which was actually a point raised in the audience, was the question of how user behaviour is regulated on public, social sites, and the extent to which socially acceptable behaviour is enforced through architectural features, and/or self-policed by the community.</p>

<p>Certainly, sites that provide private groups allow for different norms (e.g. what may be acceptable in one closed group may be unacceptable in another, or in the public space).</p>

<p>And as to how those norms arise and are enforced/reinforced? Well, that's an interesting question, and one I think I need to explore in a lot more detail...</p>

<!--
<p>Ijust couldn;t resist posting this - news of a Greasemonkey script that will <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">add Google reader into Gmail</a> <em>from Reader's own developer</em>:<br />
<blockquote>A lot of people have remarked on the similarities between the new Reader interface and Gmail's. With this in mind, I've created a simple Greasemonkey script that adds a "Feeds" in Gmail. When clicked, Reader's list view is loaded on the right.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I felt the need to write a Greasemonkey script for my own product. The answer is that integrations are hard and generally require a lot of effort before you can even determine if they are worthwhile. Greasemonkey lets you experiment with UI concepts with minimal effort necessary from either team (I had to make exactly one change to Reader to better support this script, and that was the ability to force list view to be used, even if expanded view is normally selected). I can't really say what, if any, our integration plans are, but enough users have asked for something like this that I thought writing the script was the most expedient way to provide this (unofficial) feature.</blockquote></p>

<p>Way to go.......this is similar to the reasoning behind my own <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/TU120hacks.user.js">Greasemonkey scratchpad</a> for the <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk">Technology Short Course Programme</a> delivery engine. It provides an opportunity to try stuff out on the live site <em>without</em> needing access to it in any other than than via a browser.</p>

<p>There are always niggles with this approach though - like the lack of sensible class and id attributes, and pages that don't validate (both of which make accurate DOM traversal harder than it should be...). But the upside is things that can be demoed as working on the live site, which at leasts gets round the "can't be done" arguments, if not the 'why bother?' ones.... ;-)</p>

<p>It's also a good way of finding out for real whether arguably sensible innovations <em>don't work at all</em>, for example on grounds of styling, usability or just plain <a href="http://blog.webreakstuff.com/2006/02/web-applications-fight-scope-creep/">irrelevance</a>. Oops...</p>

<!--
<p>So yesterday I finally found out who's working on the OU SL island - <a href="http://cetl.open.ac.uk/colmsct/Fellows/Jacqui%20Bennett%20page.htm">Jacqui Bennett</a>, as part of a <a href="http://cetl.open.ac.uk/colmsct/">COLMSCT</a> project.</p>

<p>(COLMSCT is one of the HEFCE funded <a href="http://cetl.open.ac.uk/opencetl/">OU CETLs</a> - Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning.)</p>

<p>The island is invite only, so if you're an OU reader and want acces then you'll need to get in touch with Jacquie.</p>

<p>I also found out that another OU project - <a href="http://www.schome.ac.uk/">Schome - not school, not home</a>  - is looking at using SL, which could be interesting. I really need to have a chat to them about doing some robotics outreach in world, something <a href="http://uk.castingcallpro.com/u/56187">Mike Reddy</a> (?!) talked about using <a href="http://flashmeeting.com">flashmeeting</a> (albeit not too successfully) at the <a href="http://www.robofesta-uk.org">RoboFesta-UK</a> annual meeting last year.</p>

<p>Anyway, having found out that <em>free</em> SL registrations are now available (without the need to provide credit card or bank details) I created a new SL OU persona for myself - <em>Tony Ehrlich</em>. If I can get a ticket for the island, then maybe I'll have a reason to learn a bit of SL scripting...</p>

<p>I still only pop into SL occasionally - my old laptop couldn't really cope with the SL client - but my new Mac Book Pro copes fine, albeit once you get passed the huge client download that's required once a fortnight (i.e. every time I log in...:-( And I still haven't tried to build or script anything. But now that I have a machine that's responsive enough for me to distinguish between me getting confused with the avatar controls, rather than the machine getting flustered and stalling of its own accord, maybe it's time to try and have a bit of a doodle...</p>

<p>There are mutterings around two or three course teams about hosting activities in world (I thought it would provide an opportunity for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/ousa">OUSA</a> - the OU Student Assocation - to host paying music/cultural events, just as 'trad' Student Unions take over dining halls for gigs, for our growing number of younger students;-)</p>

<p><h2>Rapid Stereotyping</h2><br />
One of the things Jacquie mentioned having tried out were in-world exercises in team building, where teams were given construction tasks and had to allocate roles etc. One amusing observation was that the 'players' went away and customised their appearance to suit the roles that had taken on: suits for the administrator and so on.</p>

<p>I loved the idea of this, and how it seemed to have naturally engaged the team members in the playful nature of the space. The potential for using costume/appearance based '<em>rapid stereotyping</em>' to expose people's assumptions about a role must be enormous? The extent to which particular skins/avatar appearnances influence behaviour in world might be interesting too?</p>

<p>In a similar vein to the old psychology experiments like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment">Stanford prison experiment</a> (recreated since in several reality TV shows) where subjects were placed into costumed roles as prison warders or inmates, students could be given particular avatars to use in the context of either role play exercises, or simply just specified tasks.</p>

<p>SL is big enough for this to be happening already, of course. In just the same way as the SL economy leaks into the real world (e.g. through being able to buy Linden dollars - the SL unit of currency - for real money, or SL artefacts on 'real' websites like <a href="http://www.slboutique.com/">Second Life Boutique</a>) so research/experiments carried out in SL is likely to start leaking into real world academic journals.</p>

<p>Maybe now would be a good time to pull a 'Second Life Research' conference together, in world. (Maybe there already is one...?)</p>

<p>Whether or not the current hype surrounding SL will lead to its use in a mature way (as in stable, rather than porn related: this is a huuuuuuuge issue for institutions wanting to run events in SL - it's all too easy for the unwary to find themselves in "adult" related areas of of SL) I don't know.</p>

<p>Certainly, I'd like to know more about how they count their subscribers. Trying to set up my new user yesterday, I got stuck in the login procedure several times as my <a a href="http://www.captcha.net/">captcha</a> authentication repeatedly failed (I suspect because of the OU firewall?). The names I tried to use during those aborted registrations were locked when I tried to go through registration using them again (i.e. locked as in 'this name is already taken'). I don't know if - or how often - they garbage collect names that are associated with aborted registration attempts, but this part of the process seemed really slack to me.</p>

<p>I also wonder how many registrants ever go in world more than a couple of times, especially given the 20MB+ download that's required <em>every time</em> you attempt to log in if you are an infrequent visitor. (Hopefully this will settle down over time). To their credit, SL do publish the number of people who have logged in over the last couple of months, as well as the total number of registered avatars:</p>

<p><img alt="slcurrentUsers.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/slcurrentUsers.png" width="285" height="134" border="0" /></p>

<p>So it's not that many...why all the hype? maybe it's the $$$$? But even then, I guess this figure represents an exchange rated view of the amount of in-world trade going on using Linden dollars? And as users get a monthly allowance from Linden Corp, I wonder what the <em>actual</em> actual amount of real US$ related trade is going on? </p>

<!--
<p>Over the weekend, I had a little tinker with <a href="http://www.dappit.com">Dapper</a> that lets you define what are essentially screen scraping profiles that can be applied to a set of 'look-alike' webpages and then used to present the scraped information in a variety of formats - XML, HTML, JSON, and so on.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to try and scrape some of the OU Library Voyager catalogue results pages. However, the HTML is such a mess on those pages that it bugged Dapper out confirmed via an email to the Dapper team). Attempts at scraping the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/databases.html">list of databases</a> also met with failure, presumably because the listing is so long...</p>

<p>So instead I turned to the OU course catalogue, with a view to seeing what I could pull out of pages like the course pages for <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/T324">T324 Keeping Ahead in Information and Communication Technologies</a> or <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/TU120">TU120 Beyond Google</a></p>

<p><img alt="courseInfo.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseInfo.png" width="458" height="472" border="0" /></p>

<p>How to use Dapper to scrape a page is well illustrated by a <a href="http://www.dappit.com/dapperDemo/">screencast demo</a> on the Dapper site, so I won't repeat it here...</p>

<p>So after half an or so, how far did I get? Well - why not see for yourself: <a href="http://www.dappit.com/dapp-howto-use.php?dappName=OUCourseInfov001a">OU Course Info v0.01a</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="courseinfoScraped.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseinfoScraped.png" width="775" height="136" border="0" /></p>

<p>The information I went for was the course code and title, next srtart date (and fee) plus an attempt at pulling out some assessment data.</p>

<p>I also built in a query argument to let users enter a course code so that information can be scraped from any course page:</p>

<p><img alt="courseInfoUsage.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseInfoUsage.png" width="753" height="205" border="0" /></p>

<p>Usage options include opbtaing an XML feed (e.g. here's an <a href="http://www.dappit.com/RunDapp?dappName=OUCourseInfov001a&v=1&variableArg_0=T184">XML feed for <em>Robotics and the Meaning of Life</em></a>).</p>

<p><img alt="courseXML.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseXML.png" width="844" height="224" border="0" /></p>

<p>The link option looks interesting, though I haven't tried it yet. What it seems to offer is  a way of wiring, or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007477.html">pipelining</a>, several Dapper apps together...</p>

<p>As a tool for rapid prototyping "data-web" services by screenscraping legacy web pages, Dapper looks promising. Stability issues - in the sense of parsing tatty HTML pages - need addressing, as the attempt to scrape the OU Voyager catalogue shows, but using a tool like this is certainly easier than trying to write your own regular expressions and Perl scripts!</p>

<p>I wonder whether a feature to run a page through Tidy and then apply an XSLT to it to try and tidy it up/preprocess it a little before working the Dapper magic may be appropriate? It would raise the barrier to entry somewhat for novice users, but then again, it could just be offered as a power tool...</p>

<p>...and it would still be easier than writing Perl from scratch! </p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, I'm looking forward to using Dapper quite a bit more over the coming months  in an attempt to try and get OU related information into a form in which it becomes more generally OUseful, so I'll keep you posted ;-)</p>

<p>PS 8th Feb 07: it seems that the described above Dapp has rotted somewhat and quite a few of the fields aren't being populated. This is always going to be an issue with scraping pages, and one reason why applying things like <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec">GRDDL</a> to pages containing meaningful semantics is a better bet. Until the day when XML feeds of content like this are provided as a matter of course, that is... Roll on <a href="http://www.elframework.org/projects/xcri">XCRI</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>A week in to using a Macbook Pro as my main machine (running <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a> for the odd Windows moment) and I realised today that OS/X doesn't come with a drawing package. The <a href="http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/">GIMP</a> required a big download, and Microsoft Paint running in Parallels was not quite up to scratch, so instead I checked my bookmarks for an online drawing package, and came up with <a href="http://gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, a Flash based drawing tool, and then some...</p>

<p>More to the point, Gliffy is an online, collaborative drawing package, with flowchart, UML, network, user interface, floorplan and basic shape palettes, as well as various colour fills and a small selection of text fonts. Line and connector tools are also provided, along with a range of line and arrow styles.</p>

<p><img alt="gliffy.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gliffy.png" width="774" height="585" border="0" /></p>

<p>Collabaration is achieved by entering collaborators' email addresses, which are also used as user names in Glffy, an approach I've started noticing more and more in collaborative online apps (it's the approach used by <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/?source=2e583676-5fde-4234-ace8-861af6db4b3e">Pageflakes</a> too, for example). By encouraging collaboration, the developers also manage to grow their user base for the app; enforcing email usernames guarantees a relatively pain free way of getting new user collaborators into the system.</p>

<p>Images can be worked on (presumably at separate times) by all the registered collaborators on an image. Images can be saved onto Gliffy servers as either public or private images. Public images can then be linked into other websites as required, line this one for example: </p>

<p><img border='0' src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1072480/L.jpg" /></p>

<p>A range of export options - SVG, JPG or PNG, are also supported.</p>

<p>Tools like Gliffy offer interesting possibilities for group based activities, particularly in the OU context where our students all work at a distance. The ability to collaborate in a private group on a drawing, and then export it for inclusion in the student's own work, is an opportunity we have been unable to offer to date, so far as I know.</p>

<p>There's a new OU course, <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/T885">T885 - Team Engineering</a>, due to start in October that requires students to "explore an engineering â€˜problemâ€™ in depth, working as part of a small team. The problem could be developing a product, such as a car door, improving a manufacturing process, such as forming steel sheet, or working with a variety of other engineering systems. Whatever the problem, its investigation will cover technical, environmental and business aspects and many will include a computing/software dimension."</p>

<p>This course is potentially breaking some new ground for the OU, too: "T885 is a not a content-focused course. Instead, you and your team will be responsible for gathering together the information you need to pursue your project." Hmm - I wonder if this means we'll be encouraging students to explore the range of 'out there' online, collaborative applications - like Gliffy, Writely, Basecamp, Jotspot, and so on - at the expense the tools that are (or are not...) likely to be delivered via the new Moodle VLE...?</p>

<p>Just by the by, I also note that <a href="http://writely.com">Writely</a> logins are moving over to Google authentication any time now...</p>

<h3 class="title">Technology Short Course Program Hacks  #1: Print Page Link References</h3>

<!--
<p>Doodling a few ideas for <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu210">Beyond Google</a>, I was reminded today of a hack that may yet be officially adopted into the <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk">TSCP</a> templated delivery system: referenced links on printable pages.</p>

<p>Although the aim of the game is to encourage students to read HTML delivered teaching materials l(ike these <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t187">Vandalism in Cyberspace</a> or these <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t187">Robotics and the Meaning of Life</a> tasters) online, many students are minded to print them out.</p>

<p>There are issues with this, aside from losing the character of any interactive exercises. In particular, web links described with meaningful link text lose the associated href/web address data, which means the reader does not really know where the resource has come from, and cannot easily make a note to visit it at a later date.</p>

<p>So in the spirit of hacking the courses in advance of new features being integrated into them, here's a course hack: a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkRefsTSCPprint.user.js">Greasemonkey link referencer script</a> that will automatically reference links and provide a numbered reference list to them at the end of the print page.</p>

<p>Observant readers will recognise the script is just a rehash of an earlier tool (a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005929.html">link referencing bookmarklet</a>), but hey, reuse is good, right?</p>

<p>To see the script in action, install it and visit this <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t183/html/lesson1/printintroduction.cfm.htm">example print page from T183 <em>Design for the Web</em></a>, which also be reached by clicking on the print button from this <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/t183/html/lesson1/introduction.cfm.htm">sample page of the course materials</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="t183printButton.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/t183printButton.jpg" width="826" height="200" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here's an example of the link referencing:</p>

<p><img alt="t183printReferenced.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/t183printReferenced.jpg" width="467" height="469" border="0" /></p>

<p>compared to the original:</p>

<p><img alt="t183printUnreferenced.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/t183printUnreferenced.jpg" width="531" height="212" border="0" /></p>

<p>Hmm - okay - bad example... the link text used in these links is actually the web address. But it's too late now for me to grab some more screenshots, so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it that the link referencing script does actually pull the web address out of the <em>href</em> attribute of the link, rather than the link text.</p>

<p>I need to address the styling, and maybe add a <em>References</em> heading, but it's a hack that, at least in my limited testing, appears to do what it's supposed to.</p>

<p>If you're studying any of the Technology Short Course Programme courses, the Greasemonkey script should add link references to every print page.</p>

<p>Now I wonder how else I can start hacking the course pages... </p>

<p>...and I wonder how much fun there is to be had when Moodle ships...:-)</p>

<p>All suggestions appreciated ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>Picked up from Jim Ellis' monthly Interactive Media Newsletter is the news that Moodle will be using the Yahoo User Interface (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>) toolkit as the 'official' Moodle Ajax tookit. </p>

<p>(For a demo of what the YUI supports, see <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/javascript/15-things-you-can-do-with-yahoo-uiprint/">15 Things you can do with Yahoo! UI</a>; for reference, see the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/06/02/yui-utilities-cheat-sheets/">YUI cheatsheets</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder if this means that OU online course materials delivered through the Moodle environment will also be "allowed" to make use of YUI functionality? If so, I wonder what the repercussions are for the OU online course materials XML schema (we are supposed to be moving towards an XML workflow...) More on this in a later post, (which may end up on the NOUS blog, depending how contentious it is ;-)</p>

<p>More OU news - there are a couple of posts being advertised over in IET:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2483&ref=ext">Senior Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: Your key role will be lead programmer and developer for institutional and externally funded IT projects. You will focus on several concurrent projects, including working with national and international partners developing tools such as a Learning Design player, mentoring and student support system, online surveying, eLearning support and knowledge management services. <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/pp/a.little/index.cfm?page=ld">Alex Little</a> was blogging odd bits about the learning design player, I think, and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/">Martin Weller</a> has also <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/08/learning_design.html">blogged about LAMS in an OU context</a>.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2491&ref=ext">Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: The key role of this position is to carry out software and web development for a variety of externally-funded educational technology projects. Past projects have included knowledge management tools, a learning design player and new feature development for the open-source virtual learning environment Moodle. There is a growing interest in social software in the Institute and it is possible some projects may be in this area.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2487&ref=ext"> Two Learning and Teaching Development Officers, Institute of Educational Technology</a>: We are expanding the Learning and Teaching Development Team which works across the Institute and the University to provide support for the University's learning and teaching strategies. The team are involved in cutting-edge projects, including: evaluating new course material for Open University students; getting to grips with the challenges of student retention; exploring innovative methods of online assessment; working with academics to explore best usability practice in teaching.</li></ul></p>

<p>If you go for any of these posts, please mention that you saw it advertised on the OUseful blog...</p>

<p>... or don't ... (blog post reading wastrels, pah!;-)</p>

<p>Hmm - what else is new...? Ah yes, <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/">this</a> caught my eye (after a pointer from <a href="http://www.jvvw.com/index.php">Juliet</a>):</p>

<p><img alt="courseReviewDown.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseReviewDown.jpg" width="511" height="192" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's also put paid (temporarily, I hope) to the reviews that were fed through to course pages on the the course catalogue. If you can't remember what they looked like, I (thankfully) took a few screenshots for an earlier post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">reviewing the OU course catalogue web pages</a>.</p>

<p>Juliet's observation also sensitised me to this post (obtained via <a href="http://downes.ca">Downes</a>) critiquing: <a href="http://www.pebbleroad.com/article/the_changing_face_of_university_websites/">The Changing Face of University Websites</a>.</p>

<p>And as I'm on the topic, for readers with SAMS access, check out <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/">Guy Carberry's blog</a> on design matters relating to OU materials (both print and web-based)... it's good stuff...</p>

<h3 class="title">Should We Make OUr Courses Social?</h3>

<!--
<p><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002785.php">Battelle</a> has just posted about <a href="http://othersonline.com/">Others Online</a>:<br />
<blockquote>a new social service that pairs search users in part by their similar queries, as well as pages visitedPicture 2-17 in web browsing and preferred interests.<br />
...<br />
While a user is browsing they can check the Others toolbar to see who else is reading or interested in the topic or site, and a dropdown provides contact to their IM or email details ...<br />
<strong>So what this means is.... Every time you search Google, you see the people who relate to those same keywords, plus their Web pages, and you can connect with them instantly by IM or email.</strong><br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - two things came to my mind immediately on reading this.</p>

<p>Firstly, should we make our courses (optionally) social in more than just the sense that all the students on a course are signed up to the same conferences/forums, and maybe wikis in our new courses?</p>

<p>For example, should students be signed up to (or allowed to opt in to (or should that be opt out of?)) IM buddy lists - with presence indicators - for other students in their tutor group or course? social bookmarking groups? Walled garden blogging communites? and so on...</p>

<p>Maybe we should even make a social toolbar available that easily connects students with other students in their course cohort (maybe it should have an off/off switch like an attention recorder? Hmm - maybe we could draw inspiration from the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=ie_toolbar_download">Linked In</a> toolbar (also the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download">LinkedIn Outlook toolbar</a> ), something that could help in conversation building or resource sharing/social discovery?</p>

<p>Secondly, identifying communities on the basis of similar search profiles seemed like a neat thing to try and build in to the <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk">OCI (Open Content Initiative)</a> environment.</p>

<p>So if a user is logged in to the environment, say, and is looking for particular content, then they can 'meet' other people looking for similar things?</p>

<p>In fact - I think a question worth asking is - <em>do the OCI team want to build an environment focussed on the individual, or one focussed on community?</em></p>

<p>And if the answer is <em>both</em>, then do we need two different environments, each customised to cater for what I imagine are very different user dynamics?</p>

<p>(Just as an aside, I understand  from <a href="http://ochre.wordpress.com/2006/07/24/we-have-a-name-openlearn/">here</a> that OCI is going to be rolled out under the banner <em>OpenLearn</em> - hmm, as of 9th July 2006, openlearn.com is "pending renewal or deletion" and openlearn.org is parked. I wonder if I should bid for the openlearn.com domain?;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Personal Computing Guidance for Distance Education Students</h3>

The IE7 Blog has just reported that: To help our customers become more secure and up-to-date, we will distribute IE7 as a high-priority update via Automatic Updates (AU) shortly after the final version is released for Windows XP, planned for...
<!--
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx">IE7 Blog</a> has just reported that:</p>

<blockquote>To help our customers become more secure and up-to-date, we will distribute IE7 as a high-priority update via Automatic Updates (AU) shortly after the final version is released for Windows XP, planned for the fourth quarter of this year.
...
If you decide to install IE7, it will preserve your current toolbars, home page, search settings, and favorites and installing will not change your choice of default browser. You will also be able to roll back to IE6 at any point by using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. Finally, users who have AU turned off will not be notified.</blockquote>

<p>This is something I think we in the OU should be taking into account <em>now</em> for courses starting in February, 2007 (<em>2007B</em>).</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx">Microsoft no longer supporting Windows 98</a> amidst stark warning notices ("Microsoft is retiring support for these products because they are outdated and can expose customers to security risks.") I think there is a case for the OU pushing our students to upgrade.</p>

<p>Why? Well, security for one, but with an O/S that supports a large installed base of IE7 (or <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, or maybe even something like <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> or <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>) this means that we can at the very least start to:</p>

<p>1) develop pedagogic strategies that exploit tabbed browsing (I haven't met one person who has been able to go back to a no tab browser having experienced tabbed browsing!); I think there are all sorts of ways we can develop user skills to exploit this functionality.</p>

<p>2) exploit in-built feed subscription. Okay, so I'm a feed junky, but whereas I can imagine a web future where all the pages are Atom or RSS and none end in <em>.html</em>, I can't imagine the converse... (note to self - revist <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/09/separating-navigation-from-content-and.html">The Skeletal Web: separating content, style and navigation</a> someday).</p>

<p>At the moment, OU courses require students' computers to conform to either a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/courses/Basic2007.shtm">basic specification</a> (Windows 98 SE) or a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/courses/Standard2007.shtm"> standard specification</a> (XP Home).</p>

<p>But maybe it's time to start rethinking even further..?</p>

<p>One the one hand, and one step on from the current wave of <a href="http://dip.lodoc.us/articles/2006/03/18/web-desktop-the-next-big-internet-tool">web start pages</a> like <a href="http://www.itchyhands.com/2005/12/23/overview-personalised-homepages">these</a>, the rise of the web desktops, or <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/03/01/8370596/index.htm">webtops</a> as they seem to be coming called in some quarters, means that maybe we could start to push forward an 'always on' computing specification for students who do have guaranteed, always on web access?</p>

<p>Historical note: it seems we've been here before, as this PC World article (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,32022,00.asp">"Ditch That Desktop for a Webtop</a>) from October 2000 demonstrates:<br />
<blockquote>With today's dispersed workforce and the ever-changing computer industry, organizations are consistently in a state of flux trying to keep end users up to date. The cost associated with investing in and maintaining office applications is high.<br />
To ease this burden, there is a new model of computing available today in its infancy: Webtops. These virtual desktops provide access to application suites via a Web browser. In the not-too-distant future, users won't be required to carry laptop computers to access, share, and manipulate information: They'll simply need Web appliances.<br />
...<br />
Research company Gartner Group predicts Webtops will become mainstream by 2002, and users will be free from relying on laptops to access the applications and information they need.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - so maybe that was an ambitious prediction <em>then</em> and maybe things are different <em>now</em>? For example, many of the components for a web based collaborative office suite are in place (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=123">Web Office Suite: best of breed products</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, and <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0,,1816072,00.html">virtualisation</a> is only going to get easier (it's laready becoming <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/07/19/30OPcurve_1.html">free</a>).</p>

<p>Take for example this appealing approach that VMWare describe as <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/">virtual appliances</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A virtual appliance is a fully pre-installed and pre-configured application and operating system environment that runs on any standard x86 desktop or server in a self-contained, isolated environment known as a virtual machine. Virtual appliances provide an evolutionary step in the software distribution model.</blockquote>

<p>The main idea of virtualisation is that whatever your operating system, you can run <em>other</em> operating systems 'within' it. And the idea of virtual appliances is that that these other operating systems can actually be delivered to provide a guaranteed configuration (which means installing software within it can be managed efficiently, as in an enterprise setup.</p>

<p>Hmm -  methinks it could be interesting if we had an OU virtual appliance?</p>

<p>I'm convinced a third part of the mix will portable apps too, as discussed with respect to a mooted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">USB Study Stick</a>.  Quite how this would sit with a virtual appliance (unless  perhaps that virtual appliance lived on the memory stick?) I'm not sure yet. Maybe I need to start playing with some live cd distros, like <a href="http://knoppix.com">Knoppix</a> (I wonder if anyone has integrated this with an online storage client yet, <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/05/product_idea_li.html">as suggested for Amazon S3</a>?).</p>

<p>In he same way I think portable apps could be a huge boon for OUr students, I'm also starting to get a similar gut feeling towards <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/04/now-in-browser-near-you-offline-access.html">browser persistent storage</a> (or <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/firefox-2-client-side-storage-and-a-lot-more">natively</a>) - there's nothing I can articulate as yet, but it just feels right (and it's portable).</p>

<p>So interesting times... and for an organisation with 3 year lead in times to courses that have to last 8 years in presentation (unless the model changes...) I think it's time we started imagining 3, 5 and 10 year futures a little more seriously...</p>

<!--
<p>A fascinating idea at <a href="http://www.higheredblogcon.com/">HigherEd BlogCon</a> by Matthew Winkel on <a href="http://www.higheredblogcon.com/index.php/student-to-do-list-rss-feed/">Student To Do List Feeds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The College of New Jersey provides an automated "To-Do List" on the "Resources for Students" page which enables our students to quickly navigate to clearly labeled tasks to accomplish (e.g. Calculate your GPA, Visit bookstore for buyback, Apply for federal Pin to complete FAFSA, Pay next student bill by Dec. 14). The "To-Do List" could be targeted to even more specific audiences and even personalized with current portal technology.</blockquote>

<p>This form of "To Do List Navigation" is good example of one of the ways we might use Netvibes (maybe <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003289.html">sitemaps</a>  or <a href="http://a9.com/-/company/help/siteinfo/">Siteinfo</a>also have a place in the mix somewhere, reusing the idea of <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/09/separating-navigation-from-content-and.html">Separating Navigation from Content and Style</a>).</p>

<p>The post goes on:</p>

<blockquote>An effective higher education portal will guide each user to complete specific tasks required to support the education process. Combining audience and task navigation with a "To-Do List" is an effective way to highlight navigation to important tasks that correspond with the academic calendar year. The "To-Do List" may be targeted to even more specific audiences and even personalized with current portal technology. A college senior could see items required for graduation or a new faculty member could view items required at specific times in the tenure process. Portal users could even add their own items and check off completed items on these personalized lists which they can then download to other browser based personal organizers and RSS aggregators.</blockquote>

<p>What I like the idea is of adaptively generating the to do list for each user, providing links to things users may need as they are likely to need them. The idea of ticking off items (in a manner similar to read and unread feed items) is also interesting.</p>

<p>One of the tools that would be useful in this respect would be a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004775.html">paced feed delivery system</a>, an idea Stephen Downes and I were bouncing around when he was over here a couple of weeks ago. (A couple of extra features we came up with were the ability of the publisher <em>or</em> subscriber to set the start date/commencement of a feed, as well as the publication date of/delay interval between the release of subsequent items.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.feedhoster.com/">FeedHoster</a> seem to offer the rudimentary elements of this sort of service, so maybe I'll check it out (unless anyone has useful reports on this service/other suggestions?):</p>

<blockquote><a href="hhtp://www.feedhoster.com/">FeedHoster</a>: Create serialized RSS feeds! Serial RSS feeds work in a 'chapter a day' style, where subscribers are delivered your messages (individual items) on a schedule you define, regardless of when they first subscribe. For example, Subscriber #1 will get item one today and subsequent items delivered in the following days, but when Subscriber #2 subscribes in a few days time they also start with item one and follow through with subsequent items on the same schedule. Regular RSS feeds can't do this because they can't distinguish one subscriber from another, which is why this is a special feature which we can provide for hosted feeds.</blockquote>

<p>Because always like to try and relate my OUseful posts to an OU context, I had a quick look around a couple of student facing course sites to see what sort of services we could push into a to do list. </p>

<p>Alongside things like continuous assessment submission dates, one interesting possibility was managing groups activities/scheduling tasks within a group. I'm sure I've seen this mentioned in relation to ICT tools that support OU group work (at the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/curriculum-conference-2006/">OU Curriculum Conference</a> earlier this year I think, but that was before I started live blogging this sort of event:-(</p>

<p>Tutorial dates also seemed a useful thing to be able to feed adaptively to students according to their own personalisation settings:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTutorialFinder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTutorialFinder.jpg" width="642" height="456" border="0" /></p>

<p>(I think I feel a script coming on, maybe as part of  an OU student browser toolbar... Here's a bookmarklet to get my code thinking going... <a href="javascript:function v(n,v){el=d.createElement('input');el.type='text';el.name=n;el.value=v;f.appendChild(el);};void(d=document);void(uri='https://msds.open.ac.uk/tutorial-finder/TutorialResults.aspx?unq=20060620105938364');void(f=d.createElement('form'));void(f.method='post');void(f.action=uri);v('postcode','PO33 2NL');v('dates','3');v('radius','40');v('towns','-1');v('country','-1');d.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();">Predefined OU Tutorial Finder bookmarklet</a>. (I'll build the generator in a day or two...;-) I suspect OU SAMS access is required to see the outcome... here's what you're missing:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTutorialFinderResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTutorialFinderResults.jpg" width="625" height="424" border="0" /></p>

<p>A lot of the to do items that immediately come to mind are calendar specific to do items, really (i.e. the tutorials fall on a fixed date), which has reminded of a few calendar related items I've been meaning to post. I'll post those thoughts in a day or two, and maybe in turn they'll feed back ideas for dynamically (needs based) created to do items.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Traveller (Library Remote) Script</h3>

<!--
<p>Time is a scarce resource,  which makes building a major piece of software for the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> difficult. Here then is one particular roadmap I hope to follow in assembling small standalone applications using small amounts of reusable code - I anticipate 30mins to 2 hours effort for each one. Each mini-app will provide useful functionality as a standalone item, but should also be capable of being integrated or aggregated with others items to provide a more comprehensive (integrated) tool suite. Providing separate scripts for each component: 1) allows for point testing of different functionality; 2) increases the number of "baby scripts" available for <em>other people</em> to build on or reuse (without them having to strip out other functionality).</p>

<p>As the purpose of the Library Mashup competition is to generate and promote new ways of working with library related components in a "Web 2.0 way", if anything takes your fancy in this series of postings please feel free to reuse any code snippets, interaction designs or functionality proposals in your own competition entries (though if you do create a winning entry that does incorporate ideas gleaned from these pages, I'd be happy to give you my Amazon wishlist details so you can tip me an a item or two from it;-)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you'd be willing to contribute coding effort, please let me know. As mentioned above, the roadmap is based on building a series of short scripts that can then be aggregated in a single application.</p>

<p>So then, here's the first roadmap. </p>

<p>A <em>library remote control</em> extension for Firefox (+Opera? +IE7?) that will identify pages with an ISBN in the page location (for example, the major booksellers) and automatically generate a pop-up panel on those pages that will offer the following functionality:</p>

<p>- a lookup of the ISBN number in the user's library catalogue for print holdings of that item; several GM scripts already exist that support this function. Reports should include whether the book is on the shelf, on loan, ordered, lost, not held, etc.</p>

<p>- the ability to reserve a book if it is held by the user's library;</p>

<p>- results should be displayed in a 1) floating, 2) draggable, 3)  closeable, 4) expandable panel (cf. the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/RSSpanel/">RSS Site Index Panel</a>.</p>

<p>- a lookup of ebook or scanned versions of items with that ISBN number; the provision of links to Google books, Amazon Look Inside copies etc. <em>if available</em>. The provision of libezproxied (or equivalent) links to ebooks available through the user's library catalogue; </p>

<p>- the provision of 1) a list of xISBN (and/or thingISBN) equivalents to the current book, and 2) links through to these: a) <em>on the same site</em>, (e..g on the bookseller's site) b) as a lookup on the user's Library catalogue, 3) <em>if</em> the books are available at these locations.</p>

<p>- a lookup of 1) the bookdata* for the given ISBN e.g. on isbndb(?) and 2) the use of this as the basis for a) a search on the library catalogue to find alternative versions of the book; b) for a 'suggest this book' recommendation to the library; c) of an interlibrary library loan application.</p>

<p>* it strikes me that rather than looking up books using all the xISBN variants, it would be better to lookup books on the basis of <em>author</em> and <em>title</em> if you just want to get help of a copy of a book irrespective of its edition?<br />
 <br />
(- in passing, enhance the OU library <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php">recommend a book OU internal)</a> page by: 1) offering to autocomplete book details based on the provision by the user of an ISBN, followed by a call to a book info lookup service; 2) checking to see if a book being recommended is held by the library a) on the basis of ISBN alone, b) on the basis of book data (author, title), and then reportig back to the user. If the book is already held, offer the user the ability to reserve it.)</p>

<p>An extension package (or integration of the aggrgated scripts into a browser toolbar) that provides the complete set of functionality in a single package is the goal. The babysteps that I hope will get me there is a series of bookmarklets and Greasemonkey scripts (for Firefox initially) implementing each component separately. Some components will be stepping stone/proof of concept scripts that prototype/demonstrate how to achieve certain behaviours that can then be reused in later scripts.</p>

<p>So - may the journey begin...</p>

Those conversations in turn arose - in part again - from chatting about the recent PLE gigs I've been to.</p>
<p>It seems like Martin Weller (who has just come out as a blogger at <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/">Ed Techie</a>) has also been thinking that <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/05/netvibes.html">Netvibes may be a useful as a demonstrator</a>, (even though it looks as if we are committed to <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/My_Moodle">MyMoodle</a> as a student homepage in the new VLE).</p>

<p>So out of all of this, I was wondering, would it be worth getting a few people together, doing a Netvibes briefing (if required) and then having a bit of a play to see where we can push it? Holding the session over the course of an afternoon, with a developer/hacker or two around to on the spot ad hoc prototype Netvibes modules if necessary, could be very fruitful I think. </p>

<p>The session would ideally have a set of required outcomes:</p>

<p>a) a set of shareable Netvibes tabs capable of acting as:</p>

<ul><li>a demo personal/intranet tab for OU staff;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course (in each faculty?);</li>
<li>a demo tab for CT members of a course in production;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course in presentation;</li>
<li>a demo student homepage tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL personal tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL on a course in presentation tab;</li>
<li>a demo Myopenlibrary tab</li></ul>

<p>b) identification of current services that do not have feeds; it would also be sensible to scope out what information they should expose in that way;</p>

<p>c) identification of feeds from services that do not yet exist but that would be really neat to have ;-)</p>

<p>If time allowed, it would also be useful to mock up feeds inspired by items identified under b and c with static files, (or generate the feed for b by scraping) so they could be demonstrated in the demo tabs.</p>

<p>Armed with the demos and a shopping list of required feeds, we'd have a better understanding of the PLE nature of Netvibes, a set of tabs that could in principle be used to support OU activity, a better idea of the ways in which feeds can be used to drive content into Moodle and a clearer understanding of what other service related feeds might be beneficial were they available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could launch a mini-internal competition, in which individuals would be free to post one or more shareable demo tabs, as I did in the post mentioned right at the start...</p>

<p>If anyone's interested in this competition, I'm sure I could find a prize or two somewhere (a packet of Polos, perhaps...;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Should HEIs have a presence in MySpace (and Second Life)?</h3>

<p>Robert Young, writing of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/06/19/of-social-networks-and-business-models/">Of Social Nets and Business Models</a>, provides a fascinating insight into the role of micro-celebrities (i.e. micro-influencers) within social networks:</p>

<blockquote>MySpace in particular, needs to be a catalyst for trust among its users and advertisers.  While taking a strategy of segregation (e.g. "roping off" brand-safe areas) might satisfy conservative advertisers and yield some dollars in the short term, such efforts will actually serve to undermine and limit the long-term viability of its business model by further exacerbating the distrust between users and advertisers.  Instead, what MySpace needs to do is to tackle the problem head-on by launching programs that ultimately create new levels of trust between its constituents where none existed before.

<p>...</p>

<p>When it comes to advertising in mass media, a big name is required since such campaigns are only effective if the viewer already knows who that celebrity is. But in a social network, micro-celebrities who are well known within their network of micro-communities could prove just as effective and potentially even more so, particularly if such campaigns are able to generate buzz, excitement and a cool-factor.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>MySpace can effectively play the role of talent agent by aggregating a list of users who would be appropriate for advertisers within various categories. In fact, the incentive "to be discovered" is likely to spur many users to express themselves in a manner that will position them favorably for consideration. The result is a win for everyone involved.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>By enabling advertisers to partner with users, this is the type of program that would create trust between the parties. This trust, multiplied by the number of ad campaigns and the users enlisted, could then be propagated throughout the entire social network in a manner that is completely native to the medium itself.</blockquote></p>

<p>This reminded me tangentially of the "Maths buddies" - people knowledgeable in the mathematics of non-linear dynamics - who volunteered themselves as helpers on mathematical topics at an <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/education/indexCSSS.php">SFI Complex Systems Summer School</a> I went to a long time ago (1999, I think?). Not in the sense that they are micro-celebrities, more that they are people who can be trusted on a particular topic, and so worthy of befriending.</p>

<p>Moving away now from the advertising/trust model included above, I wonder if it's worth thinking about the structures that appear in social spaces like MySpace, and working out how Universities, courses and libraries (for example) might justify a presence and make the post of their trusted status?</p>

<p>A lot of media related 'corporate' entities - like bands, for example - altready have a presence on MySpace that you can become a <em>friend</em> to. Here's one of my summer favourites: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/uiscedwr">Uiscedwr</a>, but you can find similar things for the big bands, like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coldplay">Coldplay</a> (who were almost as sublime as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/suzannevega1">Suzanne Vega</a> at the recent <a href="http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/">Isle of Wight Festival</a>;-).</p>

<p>And so I wonder how a library, or a course, might go down in MySpace... A quick search reveals there are actually quite a few <a href="http://libtechbytes.blogspot.com/2006/03/myspace-library-profiles-updated.html">libraries in MySpace already</a>, although I haven;t managed to find any <em>courses</em> in there yet (but I haven't looked very hard...if you know of any, please post a comment...).</p>

<p>One of the main questions for me, I think, is what benefits you get from actually having a presence <em>within</em> an architected social space like MySpace? So what if a student can sign up as a friend to a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t184">T184</a> Course page in MySpace? What benefits could they possibly get from such a relationship? I need to set up a page there for real, I think, and see just what sorts of things I might sensibly, and usefully, put on it. </p>

<p>Another approach would be to have lecturer's pages within MySpace and develop the idea of academic personalities who announce and maybe even actually run courses via their MySpace pages, just as band promote track releases and live gigs via their pages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, just because we <em>could</em> do all these things, it doesn't mean that we <em>should</em> do them, or even suggest that they are remotely sensible things to do... On the other hand, there may be an argument that a small number of people <em>should be exploring</em> these new ways of engaging audiences and leveraging the power of self-organising social networks?</p>

<p>PS another class virtual space that may be worth setting up outposts in are the massive multiplayer online games like Second Life. There's already a <a href="http://secondlifelibrary.blogspot.com/">Second Life library</a>, for instance, and an increasing number of organisations have started hosting events there - educational and otherwise (like the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4766755.stm ">BBC</a> for example). (Here's a <a href="http://syndicateblog.petersons.com/wordpress/index.php/second-life-educators-and-teens/">useful starting point</a> for reviewing some of the educational events that have already taken place in SL a bit further.)</p>

<!--
<p>At the moment, I'm in the middle of making a series of posts about PLEs, but the narrative I wanted to develop on this topic is getting severely distorted with the wayward order in which I'm making the postings. So just to add to the confusion, here's another out of order piece...</p>

<p>My feeling about PLEs (to be fully articulated in a fuuture post) is that whatever they are, they will have online and offline components. When I describe this to people, the example I use is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006020.html">PodNova</a> which has online and desktop client components: an online management tool where I can subscribe to new podcasts and manage my podcast subscriptions, and an offline client, wherer I can download podcasts (as well as manage subscriptions).</p>

<p>If you are using multiple clients (rather than a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">portable client</a>) then the problem of tuning your client environment so that it is consistent across clients is a significant one...</p>

<p>...unlike accessing the same web site from a variety of clients, where you would expect to see the same website, with the most recent interaction history respected (except in the case of crossing between desktop and mobile browsers/clients, in which case you might expect the sasme website to behave differently depending on your access device).</p>

<p>Until now, that is. The <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a> extension for Fireox promises:</p>

<blockquote>Google Browser Sync for Firefox is an extension that continuously synchronizes your browser settings â€“ including bookmarks, history, persistent cookies, and saved passwords â€“ across your computers.</blockquote>

<p>There are potentially huge security issues, of course:</p>

<blockquote>Browser Sync keeps all your browsers in sync with each other, so it needs to send potentially sensitive information like your stored passwords, bookmarks, and browser history to the other computers where you've installed it. Also, once you install Browser Sync, you don't need to log in every time you start the browser to access this info. Therefore, someone who uses a computer where you've installed browser sync will have access to all the info you've chosen to sync across your computers. Any new browser settings they create, such as browsing history, will also show up on your other computers.</blockquote> 

<p>The idea that all my clients - indeed all my machines - can be accessed, searched and synched via the network, is one that seems to have momentum at the moment.</p>

<p>For example, Google Desktop search will <a href="http://desktop.google.com/features.html#searchremote">search across all my desktops</a> via a Google centralised directory of the holdings of my machines:</p>

<blockquote>share your indexed files between your computers, we securely transmit this content to Google Desktop servers located at Google.</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft also offer related propositions in the form of <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/">Foldershare</a> ("create a private peer-to-peer network that will help you to synchronize files across multiple devices and access or share files") and maybe also in the forthcoming <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/livesearch/windowslivesearch/">Windows Live Desktop Search</a> application...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.foldershare.com">FolderShare</a> is now integrated in the new release of <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/overview">Windows Live Messenger</a>, along with VOIP and video chat. Niall Kennedy hints <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/06/windows-live-messenger.html">interoperability with Yahoo! Messenger</a> will be in the next release. Meanwhile, Yahoo! have just announced support for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/messenger/">plug-ins for Yahoo! Messenger</a>. Exciting times...</p>

<p>(Hmm - Foldershare would be one way of allowing students to synch files across tutor or project groups...how dangerous would that be?! Could this also be a way of getting content from OU servers to students desktops, cf. an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005516.html">OU downloader/updater</a> )</p>

<p>...we'd have someone involved in <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">Wax</a>, wouldn't we? (After all, Higher Education is now an industry, isn't it?)</p>

<p>(The main reason I'm blogging this is to keep a record of the <a href="http://www.wax.uk.com/">list of attendees</a>, just in case...)</p>

<p>And just by the by - here's a handy list of what I guess is a large part of the UK 'web 2.0 developer community' - the <a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/webapps/member/index.cgi?attendee_list">list of attendees from the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Carson Systems' <em>Future of Web Apps</em> Summit</a>. (NB Podcasts of presentations from the Summit are available. If you weren't there, they're worth a listen...)</p>

<p>As this is turning into a link post, here's some more workshop related stuff that looks like it may be interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/ucisa-ukoln-cetis-2006/handouts/">Handouts</a> from the UCISA/UKOLN/CETIS Workshop 2006 on <em>Initiatives & Innovation: Managing Disruptive Technologies</em>.</p>

<p>The forthcoming <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/">Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006: Quality Matters</a> Workshop. As an institution that supports an online student body that I guess peaked at around 200, 000 registered students, and that has committed to requiring all registered students to participate in web based learning activities within the next couple of years, I am always surprised when there is <em>not</em> someone from the OU talking about what we've acheived and how we've made it scale...</p>

<p>Also upcoming is <a href="http://incsub.org/edublog/">blog.ac.uk</a> a conference (or <em>un</em>conference?) which is:</p>

<blockquote>structured around two framework themes. These cut across the educational sectors and are crucial to life-long education provision that meets the needs and abilities of all learners - provision that is vital to empower learners as citizens within multiple communities and in preparing the UK to participate creatively, technologically and economically on a global scale.

<p>1. Deployment of weblogs and related technologies within educational institutions and the learning and teaching environment: navigating risk (morning sessions)</p>

<p>2. Blogging as community practice: impact of weblogs on current and future Personal Learning Environments (afternoon sessions).</blockquote></p>

<p>I hope to go...mail me if you're going and want to meet up.</p>

<h3 class="title">Talis Silkworm Library 2.0 Platform</h3>

Update: documentation for the Talis Platform (Library 2.0) API is now starting to appear on the Talis Developer Network at Talis Platform API. A week or so ago, a public draft of the Talis Community Licence appeared in this blog...
<!--
<p><strong>Update:</strong> documentation for the Talis Platform<br />
 (Library 2.0) API is now starting to appear on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a> at <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/platform/">Talis Platform API</a>.</p>

<p>A week or so ago, a public draft of the Talis Community Licence appeared in <a href="http://iandavis.com/blog/2006/04/announcing-the-talis-community-licence">this blog post</a>.  <br />
 It came with the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>[This licence] is going to play a key role in [the Talis Silkworm] technology platform. It gives users and contributors of all kinds of platform data some fundamental rights with one important restriction. Basically it:

<p>    * Grants the freedom to use the data for any purpose<br />
    * Grants the freedom to modify and mix the data<br />
    * Grants the freedom to redistribute copies<br />
    * Prevents any attempt to deny those freedoms to others</p>

<p>We're expecting the Talis platform to manage and make available under this licence a huge variety of data ranging from MARC to RDF and everything in-between - that's 4 decades of data formats!</p>

<p>The licence has its roots in the GPL and includes the same sort of redistribution...</blockquote></p>

<p>I mailed this announcement to a select few, with the comment that it seemed to signal the imminent arrival of an open APIs to the <a href="http://silkworm.talis.com/">Silkworm platform</a>, something that had been hinted at when <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/">Paul Miller</a>, the Talis <em>technology evangelist</em> spoke at the OU <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Well - you'll be glad to know the first phase of the Talis Library 2.0 platform duly arrived in the form of the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ ">Silkworm directory</a> last week (blogged about <a href="http://informationtakesover.co.uk/archives/2006/04/27/talis-platform-silkworm/">here</a>).</p>

<p>A few of us had had a sneak preview (much appreciated, thanks) beforehand, which is partly why I've held off blogging about it - I'm a little guilty that I haven't found the time to knock up some sort of OU/Silkworm mashup (I was hoping to find an hour (that may have turned into four - you know how it goes!) to put something together, but other things are afoot at the moment that have got in the way of anything that might turn into open ended play time...)</p>

<p>Anyway, the first <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/">Silkworm Direcroty interface</a> is now open to play with, and I'm assured API details are on the way.</p>

<p>As some details are out now, and more due any time,  I think it's probably ok to pass on some of the details that Ian Davies originally mailed out:</p>

<blockquote>Technically the directory runs off an RDF store using Jena and Joseki, fronted by a thin web app written in ASP.NET and XSLT. The directory stores descriptions of collections, physical locations and electronic services. [e.g. here's a description of the <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql?query=describe+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdirectory.talis.com%2Fres%2Fdddconv-rlg1418%23self%3E">Open University collection</a>] We'll be introducing grouping of resources, descriptions of organisations and relationships between collections soon. The services are described in detail as RDF so we can programatically build queries into them.
...
There are a number of other RDF-based services .... Each primary resource in the directory
links to its RDF representation via a little blue icon beside its title. These point to our <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql">sparql endpoint</a>

<p>For the sparql service we plan on not allowing GRAPH/FROM queries<br />
either, certainly not from day one. As we scale the service out we might<br />
enable it.</p>

<p>We're using Joseki for the Sparql stuff. All the pages you see at http://directory.talis.com/ui/ are generated using XSLT on RDF/XML coming out of Joseki.</blockquote></p>

<p>Collection information is alo published as HTML as this page describing the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ViewService.aspx?id=http://directory.talis.com/res/dddconv-rlg1418-svc%23self">OU Library OPAC</a> demonstrates (the enabled search over the catalogue even works, too:-)</p>

<p>Some of the URLs look as if they are going to be hackable, generatable(?), which is handy. For example, this URL: <em>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/bib?title=rdf</em> is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We have a public service that uses the service information to automatically link into the OPAC. For example, on that page above you can see the generated identifier for Bath University is "ad9.sw". You can plug that into a URL like this and search for RDF.

<p>The [URL] syntax is a custom one based on what we know we can support for the majority of our service descriptions. It currently supports isbn, title and author parameters. Full documentation is coming :) We plan to support "real" protocols like SRU and OAI and map them to the  capabilities of the target OPAC. These will have URLs like:</p>

<p>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/sru</blockquote></p>

<p>An RDF returning search is also supported, taking the form <em>http://api.talis.com/1/dir/collections?api_key=?????&search=open</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormRDF.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormRDF.jpg" width="663" height="420" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how the library location lookup service can be used to augment the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/update/access_acdem.html">OU 'Libraries Near You' service</a> which provides an ugly interface to a 'library by postcode' lookup service augmented with information about lending rights for OU students, as well as library opening times and other administrative information.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Silkworm version goes for a Google maps mashup:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormMap.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormMap.jpg" width="699" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment though, the OU data is far more reliable (and maintained). The Talis approach appears to be <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/GetInvolved.aspx">appealing to community support/maintenance of the library information database</a>, something the OU has done centrally (by phoning people up and hassling them, I guess!)</p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how we can work with Talis on maintaining this sort of information, and guaranteeing its correctness, for mutual benefit. (I should qualify that - I am 'outside the system' and so restricted to buolding proof of concept demonstrators that othe people would have to decide to adopt...)</p>

<p>If you want to keep up with what Talis are doing, I believe more announcements are due throughout May on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Towards a Virtual PLE? A Social Web Aggregator Service</h3>

<p>Way too many posts today - here's the last (I'm trying to clear my open FF tabs..!) <a href="http://grou.ps/">GROU.PS</a>:</p>

<p><em>* GROU.PS is a social groupware. Briefly, it is a sharing platform for social groups.<br />
* GROU.PS responds to growing needs coming along with Web 2.0 revolution. ... * Besides, in order to prevent duplicate efforts, GROU.PS can abstract distributed popular service providers like Flickr (photo sharing), del.icio.us (bookmark sharing), Digg (bookmark sharing)...<br />
...<br />
<strong>Abstract for No More Migration Hassles</strong><br />
To enjoy GROU.PS advantages, you don't need to change your favourite bookmark, photo, blog service providers. GROU.PS can abstract and synchronize with them; you just enter your login information.<br />
<strong>Universal Wrapper</strong><br />
Want to extend the capabilities of your existing Yahoo Groups or Google Groups account?<br />
You can easily do so simply by entering your login information and answer a few questions. GROU.PS wraps these services and handles the rest.<br />
</em></p>

<p>This <a href="http://grou.ps/learn_more.do?p=4">list of services they wrap</a> is a good satrt, covering Google mas (no Yahoo! maps option?) Typepad, Wordpress and Blogger blogs etc., Flickr (how about Riya?), del.icio.us, Digg and Reddit, with 30 boxes and Google calendars on the way and more promised.</p>

<p>The virtual/personal desktops/startpages (whatever...), such as <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> or <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>, are showing how readily feed'n'API based services can be displayed together, and GRO.PS appears to betaking this form of integation to the next level - in particular, a functional one.<br />
 <br />
So, this is just the sort of thing I had in mind when I blogged (opaquely, perhaps!) about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005963.html"><em>ad hoc</em> learning communities</a>.</p>

<p>Of ocurse, as with the best online services, it's sometimes handy to have a desktop client too, a role that something like the <a href="http://reload.ces.strath.ac.uk/plex/">Plex PLE</a> (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006023.html">screenshots here</a>) may be able to play?</p>

<p>I try not to post too many news item relays, but this is something that I think is important (form <a href="http://battellemedia.com/">Battelle</a> - Google (in the US, <em>and only to IE users...</em>) promoting a Firefox download on the Google frontpage:</p>

<p><img src="http://battellemedia.com/images/Googffox2-tm.jpg" /></p>

<p>What's particularly interesting (and I haven't been able to check yet) is the implication that you get the browser with the Google toolbar preinstalled.</p>

<p>I've asked internally why we don't do that with OU useful extensions, e.g. on the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/students/helpdesk/p3.shtml">Online Apps</a> CD (one reason I was given is that some students can get upset when they install a piece of software that trashes the profile they have set up on previous versions of that software). But  I'd have thought we could get round this by setting up an OU user profile, and providing an easy way for students to launch their browser into this profile (can we do that easily with Firefox?)</p>

<p>Also related to this is an issue brought up in one of the Learning and Teaching conf sessions today (and something I've thought about often before) which is (access arguments aside) are we denying our early technology adopting students powerful tools by not developing tools that only run on modern browsers?</p>

<p>When IE7 comes out, and hopefully gets installed onto XP boxes via the automatic updater, there will be significant opportunites for us to pump RSS/Atom fed information to our students. But we won't be able to do this for students running old Microsoft operating systems (we can use FF etc. as well, of course, for a bit more platform independence).</p>

<p>The OU's scale plays to our benefit here - with 180, 000 students, even if only 5% of the 10% who use Firefox make use of a Firefox extension we have provided for them, that's still a population of almost 1000 users who can test the extension for us.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like to see - and maybe this isn't so unlikely.... - is OU labs, a technology playground akin to <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a> or <a href="http://labs.live.com/">Microsoft Live Labs</a>  (Yahoo! buck the GYM trend by going for <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Research</a>) - only even <em>more</em> of a sandpit;-)</p>

<p>I did check - http://labs.open.ac.uk/ is still available ;-) - although being a university, I guess that URL could be misconstrued as relating to academic (chemistry, biol;ogy etc.) research labs...</p>
