<h3 class="title">Roundtripping in StringLE</h3>

<p>One of the 'emergent' features I've discovered about <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a> is the ability to do roundtripping - sort of.... By this I mean it's possible to use a tool in the stringle context to create a resource that you can bookmark and immediately gain access to from the StringLE navigation panel.</p>

<p>For example: if I add a feed to one of my delicious bookmark tags to the OPML file that is used to provide navigation via the StringLE embedded Grazr widget, I can create a resource and bookmark it with that tag (often from the resource creation application directly), at which point it becomes  available via the navigation widget (err, that's not strictly true - the feed may need updating in the widget).</p>

<p>As well as being personally useful, this approach can be quite powerful in a social or collaborative context, where users can create - and share links to - new resources in real time, and in one place.</p>

<p>Using bookmarks in this way - as some sort of cross between a database and a live, cross-resource navigation menu - is actually quite appealing to me, particularly when resource creation tools are tightly coupled to the bookmarking system via a 'bookmark this creation' link. </p>

<p>So I'm now on the lookout for apps that let you create resources and bookmark them directly into delicious ;-)</p>

<p>I'm also trying to think up a novel way of using <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit">Exhibit</a>, "a lightweight structured data publishing framework that lets you create web pages with support for sorting, filtering, and rich visualization".</p>

<p>For example, if you have a data source - such as bibliographic information in Bibtex format - you can use the Exhibition toolkit to produce <a href="http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/publications.html">your own interface to the Bibtex data</a>.</p>

<p>What happens is that "Exhibit essentially removes the need for a database or a server side web application" by taking the source document, treating it's contents as data, and putting a search and filter interface over the top of it.</p>

<p>Now I wonder, can I give it a <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> like back-end and use it to produce a single interface to user selected data sources?</p>

<p>Speaking of data, there's a data mashup tool just appeared on the scene too: <a href="http://www.swivel.com/">Swivel</a> ("YouTube for data" - described prelaunch in TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/05/swivel-to-launch-this-week-communitize-your-data/">here</a>.).</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that users upload their data, then anyone can remix it/plot it against other data sets (as long as the data shares at least one common dimension, such as time, I guess).</p>

<p>However, at the moment at least, it seems you can't directly plot data sets against each other withing the site limits. Unless I'm missing something obvious, it seems you can only create a graph that also includes data you have uploaded (one way of getting data into the system, I guess). The obvious workaround is to download someone else's data set (which you can do) and upload it back, I guess, then use it as the basis of your own graph.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.makeyougohmm.com/20061206/4020/">example of how to create a Swivel chart</a> (I dont have time to build one myself just now:-(</p>

<p>With online spreadsheets making APIs available (like <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/spreadsheets.html">Google Spreadsheets</a> and <a href=""://writer.zoho.com/public/help/zohoapi/fullpage">Zoho sheets</a>), it'll be interesting to see how long it takes for some online spreadsheets'n'Swivel mashups to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>What would be really neat would be to see <a href="http://www.liveclipboard.org/">Live Clipboard</a> functionality appearing on some of these sites, so users could easily cut and paste data between them...</p>

<p>I'd also quite like to see support for geo-data on Swivel, and integration with generic mapping APIs like <a href="http://www.mapstraction.com/">mapstraction</a>. Then maybe some animation tools like <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">Gapminder</a>;-)</p>

<p>Now I wonder, will <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> get into this area too? It'd be a powerful addition to a prototypical NingLE (which I am really going to have to start thinking about. properly..)?</p>
