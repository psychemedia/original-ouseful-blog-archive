<h3 class="title">Scribd and the Role of Open Repositories</h3>

<p>Some time ago, the <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> service launched, offering users the opportunity to upload and share Powerpoint presentations, as well as publishing them on the web in a small embedded slideshow player.</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd</a> has entered the game, encouraging users to:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Put your docs online.</strong><br />
Scribd is a free online library where anyone can upload. Use our embeddable PDF player to publish and view documents right in your web browser. <br />
Bulk upload now! No need to sign up.<br />
Formats: .pdf, .doc, .ppt, .xls, .txt, etc.</blockquote></p>

<p>I have to admit to having completely lost the plot now with respect to these "YouTube for arbitraryMedia" services.</p>

<p>But Scribd has got me thinking...</p>

<p>Many universities now run their own research paper repository - <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/">Open Research Online</a> in the case of the OU.</p>

<p>But as far as I know, these are all independently hosted - and I don't think there is a federated search across them (?or maybe there is?)</p>

<p>So why don't JISC get it together to provide a Scribd sort of service for the HE community?</p>

<p>Hmm - they do, sort of, don't they, at least for teaching resources: <a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/">Jorum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Jorum is a free online repository service for teaching and support staff in UK Further and Higher Education Institutions, helping to build a community for the sharing, reuse and repurposing of learning and teaching materials.</blockquote></p>

<p>I'm not sure how widely it's used - certainly I've never used it (but maybe I should...).</p>

<p>And I'm pretty sure that <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>, for example, blanks it completely... (and vice versa).</p>

<p>The problem is, there are just soooooooooooo many places to share content now. And I'm not sure what the solution is? Maybe it's that I keep all my stuff where I want it, and then share it into the communities I want to, and let search engines/harvesters pull it into other communities where it's relevant (maybe letting me know when they do, and giving me the option of stopping them).</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I've worked out what PLEs are - they're the set of web services we each use for our own purposes; and they're personal because the combination we use is unique to each of us (<em>oh, you use Google docs do you - I use Zoho; GTalk? I'm on MSN; flickr? no, Photobucket; Typepad? Wordpress...</em>)</p>

<p>PS personally, I've started to experiment with <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle">Stringling</a> <em>ad hoc</em> environments together...</p>

<p>Quick note from SlideShare to say that your post really got me thinking about this new era of document sharing and where it is headed to.</p>

<p>Your comment about federated search made me think - you could create a custom Google search engine that searches across different sites. Might be useful for a lot of people. </p>

<p>As a note, we at SlideShare are listening to thoughts about open repositories etc. as we think about future directions. </p>

<p>Do drop me a line if you ever have any thoughts/suggestions for SlideShare.</p>
