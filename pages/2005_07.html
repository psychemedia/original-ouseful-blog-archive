<h3 class="title">Keeping Courses Current with Live Links</h3>

<p>This quick post - culled from an email message that was part of another discussion - builds on some of the thoughts introduced in an earlier post <a title="OUseful Info: Managing Bookmarks" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002721.html">Managing Bookmarks</a> and considers some of the ways we might manage 'Live Bookmarks' in our online courses...</p>

<p>The question at hand was the extent to which we could use a <a href="http:routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES-like</a> bookmark management system to keep links in e-course materials current, e.g. by using a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003242.html">ROUTES XML feed</a> to populate the weblinks for the site (<a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml.php?course=Technology">example feed</a>). This would be handy for course teams because it means that the Library could keep an eye on the weblinks for the site as part of the normal linkchecking'n'fixing workflow applied to ROUTES links...</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it would be for ROUTES  to replace all the external URLs with equivalent ROUTES redirect URLs: as <a href="http://students.open.ac.uk/desktop/t846-05e/resources-p3">T846</a> have done with their Links to referenced material.</p>

<p>Something else to consider is the extent to which  a level of indirection between links in the course materials, and the final pages would allow for easier link checking.</p>

<p>(I don't know the extent to which ROUTES uses <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003940.html">DOIs</a>, or the extent to which ROUTES references can be treated as persistent URLs in their own right, but there is probably some scope here for thinking about persistent, indirect addressing.)</p>

<p>As well as allowing persistent (if indirect) links in the course materials, this indirection/intermediation potentially opens up other benefits...</p>

<p>For example, in some parts of the course, we have what effectively amount to 'Suggested further reading' weblinks. Some of these may date, deprecate, move etc, at other times the author may wish to add links that are current or particularly topical (notwithstanding the upset this is likely to cause in editorial quarters)</p>

<p>To recap, then, one way forward for link management is towards a bookmarking service that feeds links in to a page.</p>

<p>So for example, a list of 'Further Information' links at the bottom of a page could be replaced with something like:</p>

<p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://del.icio.us/rss/T184/automation%2Bcourselink"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://del.icio.us/rss/T184/automation%2Bcourselink"></script></p>

<p><br />
There are issues of course - to use the service, you need to be online. Cookies can hold up to about 4k, so this may provide one way of storing link info in the user's offline cache. Alternatively, if we install other s/w, then a set of 'default', or 'core' links could be installed to provide some recommended links when the student is offline.</p>

<h3 class="title">Online Student Engagement</h3>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was part of an interesting email exchange with a couple of colleagues (Chris Bird and John Martin) about engaging students with online activities. I didn't blog it at the time - though I should have. So what follows below is transcript of it woven together from a dozen or so email messages... (I've tried to credit all words that aren't mine....and apologies for inaccuracies, misquotes etc.). In a follow-on post, I'll comment about why I used this 'transcript' approach...</p>

<p>The thread began with me commenting on how I'm "struggling with the ongoing tension between being online, and consuming stuff in a browser. What is the expectation of students re: browser delivered material. Do they think of it as being an offline environment, or an online one?"</p>

<p>JM: I realise it is boring to say this to a techy audience, but surely the switch is when they move from modem to broadband - and a lot of T185 students do seem to be still on modems.  56K is slow and clogs up your home phone line (or is clogged up by your teenagers).  Once you have switched to broadband, you phone is accessible again, and (a very big 'and') you have learned to manage the internet security nightmare, it is a different world.  So 'students' are not a homogeneous category.</p>

<p>CB: I wholeheartedly agree with that observation, John. Not only I am still waiting for BB myself (hopefully it will arrive on 20/7!) but I'm also aware, as a moderator on various TT18x courses and TT280, that many students are still on narrowband, and may never have access to it for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>CB: I am well aware, from comments students make on the short courses, and on T171 and M150 that I tutor, that competition for the 'phone, and computer, in a family can be intense. Many students like to rapidly save a number of pages to their own PC, then study them when time permits. Even on BB, students like to save pages to disk to free up the computer for other family members (eg teenagers 'insisting' they have to use a computer immediately). What they subsequently do is often to copy the info to a CD so they can access it later/elsewhere/on a laptop etc.</p>

<p>JM: In T205 T185 I've insisted that we issue a decent PDF version for very much that sort of reason, and students have always said they valued it.  But the OU culture has tended to be rather resistant to the idea - and creating a decent PDF is non-trivial (though any student with the full version of Acrobat could make their own 'rough and ready' PDF in the length of time it takes to download).</p>

<p>So for the next year or two, should we be delivering all our e-courses on CD/USB drive, and just using the web to top the content up with downloaded updates?</p>

<p>CB: I'd certainly not totally disagree with that (well, not a USB drive as it would be possible to delete things).</p>

<p>Most of the courses I've seen delivered from the OU via a server to a student's browser don;t really need the server to deliver them - the pages can all work fine offline.</p>

<p>JM: While I have a lot of sympathy with that, the arguments against it are:</p>

<p>JM: 1.  As an author who works directly in XML, the web has the ginormous advantage that I can at last control what the student get fairly directly. I don't mean that I'm a control freak - I'm happy for others to have access to it as well (provided we know how to handle the version control issues) but it means we can correct and update almost instantly and can ease many of the project control hassles and delays.  I'm direclty on the critical path - not five wobbly sticks away from it.</p>

<p>JM: 2.  Tony already know my concerns to offer a printable version, so I think that means PDF, not just a zipped up website.</p>

<p>JM: 3.  I don't know how well combined CD/web sites work, but I do know that setting up the T185  web-DVD video is quite a techy hassle - fine for reasonably IT literate folk, but the naive IT novice would be scared off by it.  </p>

<p>JM: 4.  I know that even though T185 makes more use of the server than many OU courses, it is still very tame by Tony's standards.  But unless we get academics like me really authoring live, hands on, on the web, we'll never learn.  Even if the web is used non-interactively, it is still very different from print and CD - and I think we need to go through that steep learning curve of spending months at the screen fiddling round with stuff until it feels OK, with editors and studio working in parallel with the author, not in series - i.e. real team stuff.  </p>

<p>CB: Largely, with most of the T18x courses, I see the web content as being static during each presentation (even between presentations) and the only real use made of web-disseminated info being news updates, corrections, and the CMA/ECA. Thus there would be no reason not to have the bulk of the material on CD.</p>

<p>CB: But, and I think it's a significant 'but', if the nature of the courses<br />
change from being online to offline, with only a periodic need to connect to check for changes, what happens to the essential conference element? At the moment, with students needing to connect to study, they also access the conferences. Whilst I don't have any data that shows what percentage of students use conferences (guessing it's around 20-25%), those that do probably regard it as an essential part of their learning and make a lot of use of them (particularly T183). I suspect the use of conferencing would decline significantly in the course moved off-line. </p>

<p>CB: Out of interest, M150 is primarily offline with some online content - updates, news, CMA/ECA etc, and conferencing (both national and tutor group based). No matter how I endeavoured to encourage students to use the conferences, it was to no avail. Some never did, not even to use email. Conversely, T171, that is delivered online has enthusiastic use made of conferencing. OK, some of it is due to the 'enforced' online activities, but much of it exists purely because students need to go online to study and then use the conferences as a consequence of that (last year, my students posted 295 messages in a 4 week period!). </p>

<p>CB: Weighing up the 'do students study online or offline?' debate, maybe T171 has the balance right. It's an online course, with a strong online study element via activities, but the CT, in an acknowledgement that students do work offline for reasons I and John have previously denoted, distribute a zipped offline package for each module a few weeks after the online one is made available. Obviously, this kind of thing cannot be done with a 10 week course, but it is indicative of a recognition of how students do work rather than the way we'd perhaps like them to work.</p>

<p>JM: T205 did that also, and had that same 'delay' problem (until eventaully they 'froze' the PDF).  But T185 overcomes it by making its PDF available as a downloadable file.  OK, it is 12 MB, but even over a modem that is worth downloading as a one-off.  Zero cost, zero delay - it is available from day 1.</p>

<p>So this zipped offline  package is for who's benefit? Student's who've fallen behind, or to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002742.html">give students a legacy</a>?</p>

<p>CB: Various reasons:</p>

<p>CB: Fallen behind? - Not necessary as the material is still online.</p>

<p>CB: A legacy? - Yes, I think that is one thing students like it for.</p>

<p>CB: Another reason? - So they can unpack the zipped module on to their computer and study offline. All the interpage links etc will work perfectly, and it's a more coherent solution than relying on students to save individual pages.</p>

<p>The use of online study to pull students into the confs is a well made one, i think. Although resource wasn;t there to let us do it, I originally argued that T184 should have interactivity/animations etc to keep the student at the screen, rather than printing stuff off.</p>

<p>I didn't see the materials being online as being essential, (because eg T396 has only student confs online and these are reasonably active) but I too have since come to see that some students won;t necessarily log on *just* to see the confs, (though they may go to confs if they are logged into an OU context for other reasons...)</p>

<p>CB: I think that is very definitely the case, Tony. 'Enforcing' an online study element means they may naturally migrate to conferences. Out of interest, for T183 there is a very distinct correlation between the quality of the ECA and participating in conferences.</p>

<p>The M150/T171 comparison is an interesting one...do you think that if online materials and conferences were even more closely integrated (eg with links to relevant threads appearing in the course web page (eg from a drop down list box in each chapter, with links to conference threads on that chapter/topic)) this would encourage students to converse even more? [can;t you just tell i love techie toys?!;-)]</p>

<p>CB: Possibly. By keeping them online (but not wholly and exclusively online!), it goes a long way to reducing student isolation and can enhance group relationships as a whole. Anything that keeps students working as a group tends to induce better work. In T183, we (mods) deliberately keep a low profile when students post webpages for review. Students, after an initial shyness, enthuastically embrace peer review and support as a consequence. Mods step in when real problems arise.</p>

<p>JM: Incidentally, T185 uses direct links to FC at various points, and this can work quite well - e.g. they do an exercise and report its results via a direct link to the correct conference.  You barely know you are in FC at all, but 'participation rates' (if you can call it that) are high.</p>

<p>When T184 was being prototyped, we mocked up a 'have your say' link which allowed students to post a comment about a topic from a link embedded within a page to a simple database, and once they'd made a comment it would let them see others' comments. We never went with it in the end because i couldn't get anyone to give me access to a 24/7server with a database (long since resolved, now) but in the meantime i think that jamie has made a similar facility available (is this something you pushed for, john?)</p>

<p>JM: The original idea was from Peter Richardson (ex-ACS, now independant) who provided 'Chatlets' and 'Ideas banks' for T205.  I asked Jamie to implement a similar system for RK/T185.  It works well as a way of recording people's thoughts on the way past - but you don't get 'discussion' - usually just one very brief message per contributor - but many will contribute to those who don't contribute to FC.  They can end up somwhat in competition - so a lot of 'Chatlet' activity may actually reduce FC.  I've been talking to the VLE folk, and they are intersted in trying to create a sort of 'FC + Chatlet' system so that you can move seamlessly between website and FC-quality messaging system in any way you want without ever having to worry about whether you are in FC or not.  </p>

<p>There is also an issue with changing content during the persentation of a course. However, I think we could find a work around for this. E.g. could we call them 'Livelinks' and use a modified style, the implication being that not every student may have been served with this link.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to build in personalisation - for example, in the suggested links on automation mentioned we could add a user links section.  So for example, we give the header: My Links (automation) and a script pulls in a student's bookmarks that are tagged with a) t184, b) automation (we provide them with bookmarking bookmarklets for their browser, or on the toolbar in the course page). The script will also make use of the student's PI to get the right bookmark stash, and this can come either from the server as a result of logging in, or via a personalisation cookie. </p>

<p>CB: Time and again, in all the T18x courses I've moderated, the issue with a significant number of students is 'How can we save pages to read offline'. At one time, one might have thought it was a cost related issue, but few people use pay-as-you-go accounts now. Primarily, it is either to free up the phone line for other members of the family (if on a narrowband connection), or to free up a computer for the same reason; i.e. students save material to the computer, then copy it to, for example, a laptop for consumption elsewhere, or burn a CD and take it to work to read etc. Of course, I cannot possibly quantify numbers, only assert that it does arise with a number of students.</p>

<p>CB: We need to be careful about locking students into the necessity of being<br />
online.</p>

<p>Thanks guys - I hope you're okay with me quoting you verbatim - hopefully I preserved the context...</p>

<h3 class="title">Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)</h3>

<p>In my previous post, (<a title="OUseful Info: Social Bookmarking the Academic Way" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003938.html">OUseful Info: Social Bookmarking the Academic Way</a>) I included, but didn't link, a couple of DOIs (<a href="http://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifiers</a>).</p>

<p><em>"DOIs are names assigned to any entity for use on digital networks. They are used to provide current information, including where they (or information about them) can be found on the Internet. Information about a digital object may change over time, including where to find it, but its DOI will not change."</em> <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI Foundation</a></p>

<p>Just to recall waht they look like, here are the ones from that previous post:</p>

<p>- doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond<br />
- doi:10.1045/april2005-lund</p>

<p>So  - what can we do with them?</p>

<p>Well for a start, we can find the resource from them using a DOI Resolver:</p>

<form method=POST action="http://dx.doi.org/">DOI: <input type=text name="hdl" value="" size=45> <input type=SUBMIT value="Submit"> <input type=RESET value="Reset"></form>

<p>The DOI Foundation also provide some bookmarklets for retrieving a document if you highlight it's DOI in your browser. You can <a href="http://www.doi.org/resolver_button/doibutton.html">find the bookmarklets here</a>.</p>

<p>When I get an evening's playtime, I'll cook up a Greasemonkey script to linkify DOIs that can be scraped off a page (a bit like my <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/04/uk-postcode-linker-using-greasemonkey.html">Postcode linkifier</a> or an <a href="http://www.mundell.org/2005/04/27/librarylookup-greasemonkey-script/">ISBN linkifier</a>.</p>

<p>It might also be worth trying to work out a few sensible DOI toolbar buttons...</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Bookmarking the Academic Way</h3>

<p>When I blogged about the potential for a <a title="OUseful Info: Relevant News and Social ROUTES?" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003234.html">Social ROUTES?</a> collaborative bookmarking system, I had in mind something built upon <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.</p>

<p>Del.icio.us has been going from strength to strength, lately, not only in terms of 3rd party tools and extensions (the AJAX enabled <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/">del.icio.us direc.tor</a> is one of my favourites... for a complete list, check out the <a href="http://pchere.blogspot.com/2005/02/absolutely-delicious-complete-tool.html">Absolutely Del.icio.us - Complete Tool Collection</a>). </p>

<p>However, there are still a few things that del.icio.us doesn;t do, such as support group tagging (i.e. one account with several members).</p>

<p>So it my interest was aroused earlier this week when I stumbled across <a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>, a social bookmarking service for academics set up by the Nature Publishing Group (who have graciously <a href="http://www.connotea.org/code">open-sourced software</a>). I was reminded about Connotea again today when following a short post to the del.icio.us mailing list about Social ROUTES (that did not mention Connotea) I got this presumption(!) from Tony Hammond at NPG:</p>

<p><em>[<a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>] provides a growing body of reference management functionalities and will query authority sources for metadata (both publisher-specific platforms and also CrossRef). It supports RIS import/export, RSS feeds, etc. DOI bookmarking is a new feature as of last week, and in the next few days we expect to turn on OpenURL linking. What else? Oh user groups, private bookmarking, embargo dates, and a bunch of other stuff. Connotea is under active development and is a free service being run by NPG.</em></p>

<p>Good, eh? Tony also provided a couple of links to articles about Social Bookmarking tools in general, and Connotea in particular, which are well worth a look:</p>

<p><a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html">Social Bookmarking Tools (I): A General Overview</a><br />
Tony Hammond, Timo Hannay, Ben Lund and Joanna Scott, Nature Publishing Group<br />
doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond</p>

<p><a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/april05/lund/04lund.html ">Social Bookmarking Tools (II): A Case Study - Connotea</a><br />
Ben Lund, Tony Hammond and Timo Hannay, Nature Publishing Group; and Martin Flack, NeoReality, Inc.<br />
doi:10.1045/april2005-lund</p>

<p>Connotea also link to another social bookmarking site for academics - <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>. Again, this appears to offer support for groups, and a useful looking <em>Import from BibTex</em> facility. Unlike Connotea, which has corporate support, CiteULike is a personal venture. However, del.icio.us got funded, so perhaps CiteULike will find a benefactor too (surely <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> must be able to support this sort of thing?)</p>

<p>When I get a chance, I'll explore the Connotea and CiteULike sites in a bit more detail, and then perhaps post an updated doodled on the potential of a Social ROUTES system...</p>

<p>PS here's another social bookmarking system for education undergoing tests: <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2005/08/announcing-scuttledu/">ScuttlEDU</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Economics of e-learning</h3>

<p>Althought the <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/t182/scripts/login.php">open offspring of T182</a> is still offline, internal announcements suggest that the issue of OU Open Content is very much a live matter of debate.</p>

<p>One issue that I imagine will be of as much concern as any will be the question of economics - if our students just by courses for the OU produced content, then we'd be giving our business away (for we are increasingly considered as a business - which is another issue altogether...).</p>

<p>But are we just content producers?</p>

<p><em>Because of digitization, disintermediation and increased capacity, it is likely that demand for commercial educational content will drop sharply. Already we have seen a great deal of educational content placed online, from public institutions (SchoolNet, the BBC, NYPL, MIT OpenCourseWare and thousands more). In addition, numerous educators are producing their own content. Finally, especially in the area of informal learning, learners are producing their own content.</em> <a title="Stephen's Web ~ by Stephen Downes ~" href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/website/view.cgi?dbs=Article&key=1121044894">The Economy of E-Learning, Stephen Downes, 10/7/05</a></p>

<p>I've <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/cat_open_content.html">blogged on this before</a>, but here's another thought or two to add to the mix:</p>

<p><em>What can't we give away?</em> - other people's stuff for one thing: so we can't give away books, items that are held under copyright by third parties (including images, movies, audio, software packages etc.) because we pay for the right to redistribute it to a limited number of registered students.</p>

<p><em>Where do we add value?</em> - the "tutorial in print" and "reflective action guide" metaphors guide the production of many course units (for more on this, check out <a href="http://www-iet.open.ac.uk/pp/D.G.F.Rowntree/future_dl.htm">Back to the Future with Distance Learning -- from independent learning to interdependence?</a>), and the structure/mode of presentation is perhaps valuable in its own right.</p>

<p>The use of SAQs and learning exercises also add value, and could perhaps be stripped out of materials that are released under an open license. Personal tutor support and electronic conferencing provide supported/facilitated learning communities within each course and again can be with-held from opened up packages.</p>

<p>Assessment (both formative and summative) is another values added service, along with the provision of qualifications, and again would not be part of the free/open offering.</p>

<p>Many courses use OU developed software (once done in-house, though perhaps this will increasingly be outsourced). There are several levels of argument regarding opening up software, from simply making compiled applications freely available, to opening up the source code as well. (<a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/">KMi</a> release many of the software tools they have developed under open source licenses, but I think that all the OU's in-house educational software is closed, and the applications are only provided to students registred on the course that makes use of the software. ). </p>

<p><em>Can we "half give stuff away"?</em> Yes, in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>The first is to trust the user, make stuff (text, software etc.) available in an open format under an appropriate <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.uk">Creative Commons</a> or <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/">Creative archive</a> license - but then you have to trust the user to stick to the terms of the license. </p>

<p>The second is to not really enetr into the spirit of openness, but to give away the content in a closed format (or one that is closed enough that the average user will find it difficult to modify). So for example, giving away compiled software packages (perhaps even with 30 day use restrictions) or text documents in PDF format limits the degree to which most users will be able change or modify the materials - which means we can make them available with OU branding, or even course advertising, for example, that is hard to avoid...</p>

<h3 class="title">Open Sourcing Course Production</h3>

<p>Like everyone else here, (I think....), I make quite a bit of use of the Track Changes functionality in M$-word when collaboratively producing a document, reviewing or suggesting changes to other people's docs, and responding to changes other people have made to my docs.</p>

<p>However, I still haven't found a usable way of reviewing changes from several people that were created at different times on differently revised documents. (M$ may support a document version control system for managing collaboratively produced docs, but I've never used it).</p>

<p>So it was interesting to see this <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/wikiAnimate.html">screencast</a> about an animated change viewer for Wikipedia entries, which shows how changes can be managed in other environments (specifically, the <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a> environment). Whilst not directly applicable to using Track Changes in M$W, it may suggest some alternative ways of using Track Changes  (though it hasn't to me - yet!).</p>

<p>What is more interesting, potentially, is how something like this can be used to moderate/manage the change process in content that is produced for online use....</p>

<p>At the moment, our materials delivered as HTML from an OU server are not intended to be subject to frequent change - as with other course materials, the idea is write it, present it for the first time, fix it if necessary, and leave it. The production system is bottlenecked by workflow models that were introduced to manage the production of print materials</p>

<p>Where the subject is dynamic, however, or might benefit from contemporary news items in each presentation (rather than going with case studies from the first year of presentation), a flexible authoring/editing system is really handy, e.g. if it allows any time access to authors and editors, and also readily reveals document changes.</p>

<p>A login-required experimental wiki has been set up to help with capturing ideas about a mooted 'business web' course, although currently it's not as powerful as the WikiMedia engine underlying Wikipedia, (the one used in the screencast linked to above). It's not too hard to imagine how such a system might also be used to collaboratively author documents of a particular form, such as <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">TSCP</a> course pages, or certain forms of report.</p>

<p>Just while Wikipedia's in the thread, I also wonder whether we should be supporting closely intergrated discussion-like tabs in our online courses? </p>

<p>There are several ways the discussion page in Wikipedia can be used, of course (look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot</a> if you need a link to get you in to a Wikipedia article).</p>

<p>1) In production - e.g. for CT to discuss a page, CT and editors to discuss particulalr pages<br />
2) For logging errors/confusion during presentation; eg  logging student 'issues' with particular bits of the course (how do other people manage/log student queries with specific sections of course materials, particularly in the first year of presentation?).<br />
3) For students to discuss the topic...</p>

<p>Discussion threads related to particular sections of our course materials are encouraged in our courses already, of course, but often there is no click-thru from online materials directly to a related thread, or discussion. </p>

<p>A certain confused linearity of discussion also tends to arise in a (threaded) conferencing system by virtue of the accession order of posts into a thread. In the wiki discussion relating to a particular page, it is easy enough to imagine students constructing a discussion out of time, and maintaining the integrity of an argument (?!) by being allowed to make changes, or at least add to, the discussion at the point at which they want to comment, rather than relying on quoted text in long conference posts etc.</p>

<p>This form of discussion would allow students to structurethe page into some sort of response or commentary to the official page, or add different examples to it. </p>

<p>Many organisations are looking to their customers to participate and <a href="http://www.corante.com/brandshift/archives/2005/02/09/what_is_cocreation.php">co-create content</a>. Amazon's review system for example has been hugely successful; the open source software movement is built on co-creation of software, and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> movement is facilitating remixing and republication of content.</p>

<p>In the OU, there is occasional talk about how we are faced with the problem of lack of authors, but we have (tens of?) thousands of students who are  likely to be subject matter experts in particular areas of study, and who (as we are led to believe by the alumni association) are likely to want to give something back to the OU.</p>

<p>So what would it take for us to envisage students/alumni producing at least D1 content for us in an OU open course factory a bit like the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity">Wikiversity</a>? We'd scope out some learning objectives perhaps (or would the community provide those, so they get what they (think they) need/want? Chapter outlines, topic outlines, case studies (thought the students probably have access to better ones than we do), etc etc.</p>

<p>Increasing parts of the organisation seem to be coming round to the idea that we should take our content open. The next step, I think, is to argue that we get the students to co-create, and that we act more as course directors (in the sense of film directors, for ecxample) managing the flow of ideas and production of content with timely interventions. and shaping the outcome as a fully fledged OU course as a result ...? </p>
