<h3 class="title">A Common Academic Authentication System?</h3>

I just noticed that Google have opened up an Account Authentication Proxy for Web-Based Applications. This: ... allows the application to access a Google service protected by a user's Google account. To maintain a high level of security, the Authentication...
<!--
<p>I just noticed that Google have opened up an <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html">Account Authentication Proxy for Web-Based Applications</a>. This:</p>

<blockquote>... allows the application to access a Google service protected by a user's Google account. To maintain a high level of security, the Authentication Proxy interface, AuthSub, enables the application to get an authentication token without ever handling the user's account login information. Using the proxy, the user of the web application logs into their account through a Google-supplied login page and consents to grant limited access to the web application.</blockquote>

<p>An <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForInstalledApps.html">authentication service for installed Google apps</a> is also available under the wide <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/Authentication.html">Google Account Authentication</a> programme.</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/06/google_auth_launches.html">O'Reilly Radar</a> post on this announcement points out:</p>

<blockquote>This service lets you build a web app that uses Google's user accounts for user authentication. All the build-to-flip optimists will immediately adopt it, but the rest of us probably aren't willing to cede our users to Google just yet. The word I had from inside Google is that this is not an identity play, it's something they were developing for internal use and are offering externally to help people build add-ons to Google services (e.g., the documentation talks about a website with calendar data letting the users of the website add the dates to their Google Calendar).</blockquote>

<p>[<strong:Update:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/">John Dale</a> provides a useful (and concise) summary <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/google_account_authentication/">here</a>]</p>

<p>A couple of possibly OUseful things strike me about this:</p>

<p>1) would it be handy building a Google authentication into Moodle, so that Google services can be brought into that environment in PLE fashion (by which I mean that the users get to customise the <em>VLE</em> (whether OU, or <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">OCI</a>) by bringing in their own feeds and services etc. That is, using the VLE as a presentational shell for external services the student chooses to use?</p>

<p>2) The VC's bash asking whether the time is ripe to start moving <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006923.html">Towards a Global Online University</a> threw up a few comments about what would be involved in a global play, as did <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007019.html">Downe's talk on PLEs</a> the same day. (I need to start anchor naming sections of long posts, don't I, so I can link straight to the relevant section?) One thing I wonder is whether the provision of an academic web services framework (like the eBay or Amazon  e-commerce frameworks) may be one way to go? If so, providing a single sign on for users to access learning related services may be useful? Could users have a single sign on, for example, that would work across Moodle and elgg installations that were aligned with the single academic sign on service?</p>

<p>[<strong>Update 2:</strong> Stephen Downes picks up on some of the identity schemes that are gaining traction in a grass roots way in his personal <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/06/identity-networks-are-here.html">half hour post</a> today (err, yesterday?).]</p>

<!--
<p>I was chatting today with Jon Rosewell, a departmental colleague, about a departmental research meeting we had last week and in particular the use of academic publishing for reputation building.</p>

<p>At the time, this meeting threw up several recurrent themes, not least that whilst department members don't tend to engage in <a href="http://www.rae.ac.uk/">RAE</a> related research activity (the only thing we are allowed to call research...) we are very involved in scholarly research effort. Another takeaway conclusion from the meeting, introduced by David Gorham (and the subject of an interesting discussion with him tonight...are you blogging it, David? Or perhaps you'll make a comment?;-) was that 'research' activity is as nothing if it isn't disseminated in some way.  The outcomes of the meeting are being distilled in (yet another?) departmental mission statement, and the one that is emerging looks quite promising, not least because of the philosophy - and vision - it captures. When the final statement is decided, I may well blog it with a bit of commentary, not least because it looks like it could frame some of the reasons I have for maintaining this blog.</p>

<p>Anyway - back to the reputation building conversation with Jon, and one of the things that arose was the potential use of blogging for building academic reputation.</p>

<p>In certain extreme cases this may result in the creation of notable <em>personal brands</em>, that may often reflect well on, and raise the profile of, the reputation of the institutions that employ (and tolerate?) the individuals concerned. (At this point I have to ground this with a mention someone like <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a>, of course, but I think in edublog circles at least <a href="http://downes.ca/">Stephen Downes</a> would also rate here.)</p>

<p>The perception that audiences will increasingly make <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005967.html">appointments with personalities</a> may also have a bearing here, as anticipated for example by the owners of <a href="http://podtech.net">PodTech.net</a> who just <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5070940.stm">recruited Scoble</a> and tech blogger Om Malik, who recently left <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/">Business 2.0</a> to set up his own <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOM </a>.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Reputation</strong></p>

<p>Estimating the extent to which an academic's reputation may be enhanced (or harmed) by blogging is a fraught affair, and one that I haven't really considered, save for the occasional (ok, daily;-) look at my <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> stats. But that only captures traffic from the people who subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Feedburner feed</a> and not those subscribing to the feed that comes directly off the blog (move over, chaps - there's <em>more content</em> (in the form of my top <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">daily OUseful delicious links</a>) on the Feedburner feed...).</p>

<p>Just measuring the number of subscribers is not necessarily useful for measuring <em>academic reputation</em>. Traditionally, such reputation is developed (in research terms) through publishing in high quality <em>peer reviewed</em> journals. I guess that high quality publications also improve the <em>influence</em>(?) of the academics who publish there, e.g. in the sense that those journals have a large and knoweldgeable audience who may well be influenced by the things the read. (Influence in two ways: <em>awareness</em> of the publication, and <em>citable influence</em>, where the paper makes such an impact on a reader that they go on to cite it in their own work).</p>

<p>Here, the key items are <em>peer review</em> (the gatekeeper on getting content into a publication), <em>readership</em> (or audience) - who subscribes to, and/or regulalry reads or trachks the contents of the journal, and <em>citation</em> - who picks up on the work strongly enough to want to refer to it.</p>

<p>Considering each of these in the context of using blogs to build academic reputation, two features would seem to be trivially (relatively!) mappable: <em>readership</em> (as measured by (academic) subscribers; and <em>citation</em>: links from <em>other</em> academic bloggers (with a reasonable reputation).</p>

<p>So I guess I'm proposing something like the following: academic blogger reputation is some function of the size and reputation of the academic readership, and the size and reputation of the number of citations the blogger has received.</p>

<p>Something like <a href="http://about.ask.com/en/docs/about/webmasters.shtml">ExpertRank</a>, perhaps?</p>

<blockquote>Our ExpertRank algorithm goes beyond mere link popularity (which ranks pages based on the sheer volume of links pointing to a particular page) to determine popularity among pages considered to be experts on the topic of your search. This is known as subject-specific popularity. Identifying topics (also known as "clusters"), the experts on those topics, and the popularity of millions of pages amongst those experts -- at the exact moment your search query is conducted -- requires many additional calculations that other search engines do not perform.</blockquote>

<p>So how might this work?</p>

<p>Well, it's late, this post is way too long already, but here's some stuff for the mix:</p>

<ul><li>Host the blog on an institutional server; (here's an earlier post on a related topic: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005297.html">Blogging to an Institutional Repository</a>;</li>
<li>collect stats on the <em>domains</em> subscribers come from, scoring ones form .edu or .ac.uk as "academic related"; similarly for comments (which tend to have a self-identification element of the person posting the comment) and trackbacks (which similarly incorporate self-identification of the person making the Trackback);</li>
<li><em>find a mechanism by which subscribers could set their reader user agent so that it identifies the human reader</em>...for example, use the reader agent to transmit the location of something like a FOAF file for the human reader. In this way, readers could announce to a publisher that they have subscribed to a feed, whioch would be good for network building. (This would be open to abuse of course...but I'm just flying kites here...);</li></ul>

<p>This last point has traction I think - finding ways by which subscribers can identify themselves as individuals to feed publishers - and I need to think about it some more, so no more on this here for the moment... (except to say I'm thinking of something more elegant than a user getting a feed from a password protected account that they had to set up previously. What I want is a client side solution - the one-click user subscription model used for normal feeds would have to remain... ).</p>

<p>(I also wonder whether a client side solution could be used to implement <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007078.html">paced feed delivery</a>...? )</p>

<p>One further potential payoff of this identity sharing from the part of the subscriber is that it could be used to support personalised feeds....</p>

<p><strong>Personalised Feeds</strong></p>

<p>How this also relates to the delivery of personalised feeds (e.g. as in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007078.html">paced feed delivery</a>) is something I need to think about. Certainly, there may be server side implications, as this post (from November '05) on <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/11/personalized_fe.html">personalised feeds</a> suggests:</p>

<blockquote><em>Personalized RSS feeds</em> is one of the issues that hit me in the face recently. In the past few weeks, I've subscribed to a few RSS feeds that were personalized just for me. Specifically, when I subscribed, the URL that ended up in FeedDemon / NGOS (the aggregator that I use) had a unique identifier at the end. If I subscribed a second time (pretending I was a different person), I got a different unique identifier and ended up with two feeds. This is distinct from a feed that I've customized such as a delicious tag feed that is still a generic feed that presumably multiple people will subscribe to if they use the same parameters that I do.</blockquote>

<p>(The post goes on to describe problems with this model - the need for the feed producer to generate multiple versions, effectively, of the same feed; the way this approach breaks sharing the feed via an OPML feedroll, and so on.)</p>

<p>The feeds could be further customised by the institution through the inclusion of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006952.html">limited forms of advertising</a> etc.</p>

<p>Just one final related point -  a debate I haven't been following at all (though I have doodled about related things before as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005509.html">Peer Review 2.0</a>), but think I should try to catch up on: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/index.html">Nature Publishing Group's Peer Review Trial and Debate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In Nature's peer review trial, lasting for three months, authors can choose to have their submissions posted on a preprint server for open comments, in parallel with the conventional peer review process. Anyone in the field may then post comments, provided they are prepared to identify themselves. Once the usual confidential peer review process is complete, the public 'open peer review' process will be closed. Nature will report on the results after the trial period is over.</blockquote>

<p>Linking this back to the idea introduced above: what I'd like is an academic blogging system in which the feed reading client can reveal the (institutionally authenticated?) identity of the person subscribing to the feed to the publisher. A commenting client  that similarly reveal the (institutionally authenticated?) identity of the person commenting on an academic post. A blog posting client that can send (institutionally authenticated?) identified trackbacks to other academic blogs. A blog publishing system which can log and report on academic, identity verified subscriptions, comments and trackbacks. The publishing system should also work with non-academic subscribers, commenters, trackbacks etc., but not necessarily use the related data for academic reputation logs.</p>

<p>Using IP addresses, or <a href="http://edina.ac.uk/projects/sdss/">Shibboleth</a>, or maybe even a <em>blogezproxy</em> equivalent to <a href="http://www.usefulutilities.com/">libezproxy</a>, to validate the academic credentials of the subscriber/commenter/trackbacker may not be so difficult???</p>

<p>Maybe this could all be built into some weird combination of <a href="http://edupress.mrbelshaw.co.uk/?page_id=7">EduPress</a> and an <a href="http://www.eprints.org/">eprints</a> server?</p>

<!--
<p>Last week, I managed to get a <a href="http://blogbridge.com/trial1/">trial user account</a> on the new BlogBridge Library, which I briefly posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007024.html">here</a>  when the demo was launched.</p>

<p>The BlogBridge Library provides you with a space to manage feeds using a metaphor I described previously as akin to a bookshelf. What really appeals to me is how this sort of display might be useful in managing the display of contents feeds from online journals.  In use, I imagine myself to be stood in the library by the journals collection, leafing through print journals, scanning their contents lists and perhaps flicking through an abstract or two...</p>

<p><img alt="journalBookshelf.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/journalBookshelf.JPG" width="548" height="163" border="0" /></p>

<p>Each shelf display 4 titles at a time, with up to 4 sets of 4 titles being supported on the bookshelf at any one time. </p>

<p>One feature that might be useful here would be the ability to choose the image that should be displayed as the bookshelf graphic. (At the moment, the image is an image of the webpage that hosts the target feed, obtained as an <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=126">Alexa site thumbnail image</a>.)</p>

<p>For collections containing more than 4 x 4 = 16 titles, clicking through the bookshelf title bar reveals all the titles on the bookshelf:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFullShelf.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFullShelf.jpg" width="520" height="494" border="0" /></p>

<p>The above shelf image (i.e. the singlerow of 4 titles) shows the result of importing an OPML file  of feeds <em>live from the web</em> (from <a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/help/oxfordjournals.opml.xml">here</a>, in this case) into the BBLibrary.</p>

<p>Although you can see an OPML feed of the uploaded feeds is available, feeds from the individual journals are not, which I take to be a bug, as this other bookshelf (representing an upload of an OPML fiel from my hard drive, generated by my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseLinksOPML.html">course OPML generator</a>) suggests:</p>

<p><img alt="bblS804.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblS804.jpg" width="530" height="188" border="0" /></p>

<p>Nested folders on a shelf are also supported, as this <a href="http://npg.nature.com/pdf/newsfeeds.opml">OPML list of Nature Publishing Group journal feeds</a> (see <a href="http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_newsfeed.xml&style=xml/02_newsfeed.xsl">here</a>) demonstrates:</p>

<p><img alt="bblNested.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblNested.jpg" width="537" height="160" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking throught the bookshelf title bar takes you to a 'sub' bookshelf containing shelves for each nested bundle of feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="bblNestedFull.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblNestedFull.jpg" width="534" height="533" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing that would be neat here would be for the system to generate a separate OPML file for each shelf in this collection, and provide a link to this file both from these 'sub'bookshelfs, but also from the folder view.</p>

<p>Again, I think there may be a minor bug in the sysitem here becuase some folders <em>do</em> also carry OPML feed links for their contents as both this folder view shows:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFolderFeed.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFolderFeed.jpg" width="530" height="165" border="0" /></p>

<p>and it's correpsonding sub-bookshelf rack:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFolderFeed2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFolderFeed2.jpg" width="526" height="467" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'd quite like to see is a preview of the contents of each feed (something I believe may be on the way...).</p>

<p>In terms of design, the approach followed in Netvibes for previewing feeds may be reusable here. For example, here's a Netvibes feed title preview, along with a description (Journal abstract?) preview:</p>

<p><img alt="ieeeTitlePreview.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ieeeTitlePreview.jpg" width="331" height="204" border="0" /></p>

<p>Netvibes also lets you look at the whole description text in feedreader style panel:</p>

<p><img alt="ieeePostNV.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ieeePostNV.JPG" width="787" height="417" border="0" /></p>

<p>but I believe that the intention of the BlogBridge Library folks is not to move into feedreader territory, although feed previews are very much on their to do list.</p>

<p>Form a library point of view, wether than being able to click through from a  feed item link to a feed reader view of that item, it would be neat to be able to configure my view of the bookshelf to let me click straight through to the full text of a journal article via an inserted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">libezproxy</a> link...</p>

<p>Okay, here's the first bit of my <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> long path <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007069.html">Library remote</a> competition entry: a Greasemonkey script that looks ISBNs in the URL of a loaded page and if it finds one it displays a draggable panel containing library lookup links.</p>

<p>The code is virtually all stolen - the library lookup bits I have been using for ages and can't remember where they came from originally.</p>

<p>The draggable stuff is from <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/RSSpanel/">RSS Panel</a> (where in turn it was reused from <a href="http://bookburro.org/">Vook Burro</a>. Hmm - looking at that script for the first time I can remember, it seems there's a lot of stuff that can be reused from there. Ho hum - nothing new under the sun...).</p>

<p>The regular expression used to pull out the ISBNs is a modified version of the one used in Udell's <a hre="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Library Lookup script</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few screen shots. The panel is draggable and originally launches in the top left hand corner of the screen.</p>

<p>A fascinating idea at <a href="http://www.higheredblogcon.com/">HigherEd BlogCon</a> by Matthew Winkel on <a href="http://www.higheredblogcon.com/index.php/student-to-do-list-rss-feed/">Student To Do List Feeds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The College of New Jersey provides an automated "To-Do List" on the "Resources for Students" page which enables our students to quickly navigate to clearly labeled tasks to accomplish (e.g. Calculate your GPA, Visit bookstore for buyback, Apply for federal Pin to complete FAFSA, Pay next student bill by Dec. 14). The "To-Do List" could be targeted to even more specific audiences and even personalized with current portal technology.</blockquote>

<p>This form of "To Do List Navigation" is good example of one of the ways we might use Netvibes (maybe <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003289.html">sitemaps</a>  or <a href="http://a9.com/-/company/help/siteinfo/">Siteinfo</a>also have a place in the mix somewhere, reusing the idea of <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/09/separating-navigation-from-content-and.html">Separating Navigation from Content and Style</a>).</p>

<p>The post goes on:</p>

<blockquote>An effective higher education portal will guide each user to complete specific tasks required to support the education process. Combining audience and task navigation with a "To-Do List" is an effective way to highlight navigation to important tasks that correspond with the academic calendar year. The "To-Do List" may be targeted to even more specific audiences and even personalized with current portal technology. A college senior could see items required for graduation or a new faculty member could view items required at specific times in the tenure process. Portal users could even add their own items and check off completed items on these personalized lists which they can then download to other browser based personal organizers and RSS aggregators.</blockquote>

<p>What I like the idea is of adaptively generating the to do list for each user, providing links to things users may need as they are likely to need them. The idea of ticking off items (in a manner similar to read and unread feed items) is also interesting.</p>

<p>One of the tools that would be useful in this respect would be a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004775.html">paced feed delivery system</a>, an idea Stephen Downes and I were bouncing around when he was over here a couple of weeks ago. (A couple of extra features we came up with were the ability of the publisher <em>or</em> subscriber to set the start date/commencement of a feed, as well as the publication date of/delay interval between the release of subsequent items.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.feedhoster.com/">FeedHoster</a> seem to offer the rudimentary elements of this sort of service, so maybe I'll check it out (unless anyone has useful reports on this service/other suggestions?):</p>

<blockquote><a href="hhtp://www.feedhoster.com/">FeedHoster</a>: Create serialized RSS feeds! Serial RSS feeds work in a 'chapter a day' style, where subscribers are delivered your messages (individual items) on a schedule you define, regardless of when they first subscribe. For example, Subscriber #1 will get item one today and subsequent items delivered in the following days, but when Subscriber #2 subscribes in a few days time they also start with item one and follow through with subsequent items on the same schedule. Regular RSS feeds can't do this because they can't distinguish one subscriber from another, which is why this is a special feature which we can provide for hosted feeds.</blockquote>

<p>Because always like to try and relate my OUseful posts to an OU context, I had a quick look around a couple of student facing course sites to see what sort of services we could push into a to do list. </p>

<p>Alongside things like continuous assessment submission dates, one interesting possibility was managing groups activities/scheduling tasks within a group. I'm sure I've seen this mentioned in relation to ICT tools that support OU group work (at the <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/curriculum-conference-2006/">OU Curriculum Conference</a> earlier this year I think, but that was before I started live blogging this sort of event:-(</p>

<p>Tutorial dates also seemed a useful thing to be able to feed adaptively to students according to their own personalisation settings:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTutorialFinder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTutorialFinder.jpg" width="642" height="456" border="0" /></p>

<p>(I think I feel a script coming on, maybe as part of  an OU student browser toolbar... Here's a bookmarklet to get my code thinking going... <a href="javascript:function v(n,v){el=d.createElement('input');el.type='text';el.name=n;el.value=v;f.appendChild(el);};void(d=document);void(uri='https://msds.open.ac.uk/tutorial-finder/TutorialResults.aspx?unq=20060620105938364');void(f=d.createElement('form'));void(f.method='post');void(f.action=uri);v('postcode','PO33 2NL');v('dates','3');v('radius','40');v('towns','-1');v('country','-1');d.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();">Predefined OU Tutorial Finder bookmarklet</a>. (I'll build the generator in a day or two...;-) I suspect OU SAMS access is required to see the outcome... here's what you're missing:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTutorialFinderResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTutorialFinderResults.jpg" width="625" height="424" border="0" /></p>

<p>A lot of the to do items that immediately come to mind are calendar specific to do items, really (i.e. the tutorials fall on a fixed date), which has reminded of a few calendar related items I've been meaning to post. I'll post those thoughts in a day or two, and maybe in turn they'll feed back ideas for dynamically (needs based) created to do items.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Traveller (Library Remote) Script</h3>

<!--
<p>Time is a scarce resource,  which makes building a major piece of software for the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> difficult. Here then is one particular roadmap I hope to follow in assembling small standalone applications using small amounts of reusable code - I anticipate 30mins to 2 hours effort for each one. Each mini-app will provide useful functionality as a standalone item, but should also be capable of being integrated or aggregated with others items to provide a more comprehensive (integrated) tool suite. Providing separate scripts for each component: 1) allows for point testing of different functionality; 2) increases the number of "baby scripts" available for <em>other people</em> to build on or reuse (without them having to strip out other functionality).</p>

<p>As the purpose of the Library Mashup competition is to generate and promote new ways of working with library related components in a "Web 2.0 way", if anything takes your fancy in this series of postings please feel free to reuse any code snippets, interaction designs or functionality proposals in your own competition entries (though if you do create a winning entry that does incorporate ideas gleaned from these pages, I'd be happy to give you my Amazon wishlist details so you can tip me an a item or two from it;-)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you'd be willing to contribute coding effort, please let me know. As mentioned above, the roadmap is based on building a series of short scripts that can then be aggregated in a single application.</p>

<p>So then, here's the first roadmap. </p>

<p>A <em>library remote control</em> extension for Firefox (+Opera? +IE7?) that will identify pages with an ISBN in the page location (for example, the major booksellers) and automatically generate a pop-up panel on those pages that will offer the following functionality:</p>

<p>- a lookup of the ISBN number in the user's library catalogue for print holdings of that item; several GM scripts already exist that support this function. Reports should include whether the book is on the shelf, on loan, ordered, lost, not held, etc.</p>

<p>- the ability to reserve a book if it is held by the user's library;</p>

<p>- results should be displayed in a 1) floating, 2) draggable, 3)  closeable, 4) expandable panel (cf. the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/RSSpanel/">RSS Site Index Panel</a>.</p>

<p>- a lookup of ebook or scanned versions of items with that ISBN number; the provision of links to Google books, Amazon Look Inside copies etc. <em>if available</em>. The provision of libezproxied (or equivalent) links to ebooks available through the user's library catalogue; </p>

<p>- the provision of 1) a list of xISBN (and/or thingISBN) equivalents to the current book, and 2) links through to these: a) <em>on the same site</em>, (e..g on the bookseller's site) b) as a lookup on the user's Library catalogue, 3) <em>if</em> the books are available at these locations.</p>

<p>- a lookup of 1) the bookdata* for the given ISBN e.g. on isbndb(?) and 2) the use of this as the basis for a) a search on the library catalogue to find alternative versions of the book; b) for a 'suggest this book' recommendation to the library; c) of an interlibrary library loan application.</p>

<p>* it strikes me that rather than looking up books using all the xISBN variants, it would be better to lookup books on the basis of <em>author</em> and <em>title</em> if you just want to get help of a copy of a book irrespective of its edition?<br />
 <br />
(- in passing, enhance the OU library <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php">recommend a book OU internal)</a> page by: 1) offering to autocomplete book details based on the provision by the user of an ISBN, followed by a call to a book info lookup service; 2) checking to see if a book being recommended is held by the library a) on the basis of ISBN alone, b) on the basis of book data (author, title), and then reportig back to the user. If the book is already held, offer the user the ability to reserve it.)</p>

<p>An extension package (or integration of the aggrgated scripts into a browser toolbar) that provides the complete set of functionality in a single package is the goal. The babysteps that I hope will get me there is a series of bookmarklets and Greasemonkey scripts (for Firefox initially) implementing each component separately. Some components will be stepping stone/proof of concept scripts that prototype/demonstrate how to achieve certain behaviours that can then be reused in later scripts.</p>

<p>So - may the journey begin...</p>

<p>I recently posted about some <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007002.html">OU Netvibes Modules</a> which in part resulted from a few email discussions I'd been having about Netvibes with other folks here in the OU. Those conversations in turn arose - in part again - from chatting about the recent PLE gigs I've been to.</p>
<p>It seems like Martin Weller (who has just come out as a blogger at <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/">Ed Techie</a>) has also been thinking that <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2006/05/netvibes.html">Netvibes may be a useful as a demonstrator</a>, (even though it looks as if we are committed to <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/My_Moodle">MyMoodle</a> as a student homepage in the new VLE).</p>

<p>So out of all of this, I was wondering, would it be worth getting a few people together, doing a Netvibes briefing (if required) and then having a bit of a play to see where we can push it? Holding the session over the course of an afternoon, with a developer/hacker or two around to on the spot ad hoc prototype Netvibes modules if necessary, could be very fruitful I think. </p>

<p>The session would ideally have a set of required outcomes:</p>

<p>a) a set of shareable Netvibes tabs capable of acting as:</p>

<ul><li>a demo personal/intranet tab for OU staff;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course (in each faculty?);</li>
<li>a demo tab for CT members of a course in production;</li>
<li>a demo tab for a course in presentation;</li>
<li>a demo student homepage tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL personal tab;</li>
<li>a demo AL on a course in presentation tab;</li>
<li>a demo Myopenlibrary tab</li></ul>

<p>b) identification of current services that do not have feeds; it would also be sensible to scope out what information they should expose in that way;</p>

<p>c) identification of feeds from services that do not yet exist but that would be really neat to have ;-)</p>

<p>If time allowed, it would also be useful to mock up feeds inspired by items identified under b and c with static files, (or generate the feed for b by scraping) so they could be demonstrated in the demo tabs.</p>

<p>Armed with the demos and a shopping list of required feeds, we'd have a better understanding of the PLE nature of Netvibes, a set of tabs that could in principle be used to support OU activity, a better idea of the ways in which feeds can be used to drive content into Moodle and a clearer understanding of what other service related feeds might be beneficial were they available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could launch a mini-internal competition, in which individuals would be free to post one or more shareable demo tabs, as I did in the post mentioned right at the start...</p>

<p>If anyone's interested in this competition, I'm sure I could find a prize or two somewhere (a packet of Polos, perhaps...;-)</p>

<p>Robert Young, writing of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/06/19/of-social-networks-and-business-models/">Of Social Nets and Business Models</a>, provides a fascinating insight into the role of micro-celebrities (i.e. micro-influencers) within social networks:</p>

<blockquote>MySpace in particular, needs to be a catalyst for trust among its users and advertisers.  While taking a strategy of segregation (e.g. "roping off" brand-safe areas) might satisfy conservative advertisers and yield some dollars in the short term, such efforts will actually serve to undermine and limit the long-term viability of its business model by further exacerbating the distrust between users and advertisers.  Instead, what MySpace needs to do is to tackle the problem head-on by launching programs that ultimately create new levels of trust between its constituents where none existed before.

<p>...</p>

<p>When it comes to advertising in mass media, a big name is required since such campaigns are only effective if the viewer already knows who that celebrity is. But in a social network, micro-celebrities who are well known within their network of micro-communities could prove just as effective and potentially even more so, particularly if such campaigns are able to generate buzz, excitement and a cool-factor.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>MySpace can effectively play the role of talent agent by aggregating a list of users who would be appropriate for advertisers within various categories. In fact, the incentive "to be discovered" is likely to spur many users to express themselves in a manner that will position them favorably for consideration. The result is a win for everyone involved.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>By enabling advertisers to partner with users, this is the type of program that would create trust between the parties. This trust, multiplied by the number of ad campaigns and the users enlisted, could then be propagated throughout the entire social network in a manner that is completely native to the medium itself.</blockquote></p>

<p>This reminded me tangentially of the "Maths buddies" - people knowledgeable in the mathematics of non-linear dynamics - who volunteered themselves as helpers on mathematical topics at an <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/education/indexCSSS.php">SFI Complex Systems Summer School</a> I went to a long time ago (1999, I think?). Not in the sense that they are micro-celebrities, more that they are people who can be trusted on a particular topic, and so worthy of befriending.</p>

<p>Moving away now from the advertising/trust model included above, I wonder if it's worth thinking about the structures that appear in social spaces like MySpace, and working out how Universities, courses and libraries (for example) might justify a presence and make the post of their trusted status?</p>

<p>A lot of media related 'corporate' entities - like bands, for example - altready have a presence on MySpace that you can become a <em>friend</em> to. Here's one of my summer favourites: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/uiscedwr">Uiscedwr</a>, but you can find similar things for the big bands, like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coldplay">Coldplay</a> (who were almost as sublime as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/suzannevega1">Suzanne Vega</a> at the recent <a href="http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/">Isle of Wight Festival</a>;-).</p>

<p>And so I wonder how a library, or a course, might go down in MySpace... A quick search reveals there are actually quite a few <a href="http://libtechbytes.blogspot.com/2006/03/myspace-library-profiles-updated.html">libraries in MySpace already</a>, although I haven;t managed to find any <em>courses</em> in there yet (but I haven't looked very hard...if you know of any, please post a comment...).</p>

<p>One of the main questions for me, I think, is what benefits you get from actually having a presence <em>within</em> an architected social space like MySpace? So what if a student can sign up as a friend to a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t184">T184</a> Course page in MySpace? What benefits could they possibly get from such a relationship? I need to set up a page there for real, I think, and see just what sorts of things I might sensibly, and usefully, put on it. </p>

<p>Another approach would be to have lecturer's pages within MySpace and develop the idea of academic personalities who announce and maybe even actually run courses via their MySpace pages, just as band promote track releases and live gigs via their pages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, just because we <em>could</em> do all these things, it doesn't mean that we <em>should</em> do them, or even suggest that they are remotely sensible things to do... On the other hand, there may be an argument that a small number of people <em>should be exploring</em> these new ways of engaging audiences and leveraging the power of self-organising social networks?</p>

<p>PS another class virtual space that may be worth setting up outposts in are the massive multiplayer online games like Second Life. There's already a <a href="http://secondlifelibrary.blogspot.com/">Second Life library</a>, for instance, and an increasing number of organisations have started hosting events there - educational and otherwise (like the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4766755.stm ">BBC</a> for example). (Here's a <a href="http://syndicateblog.petersons.com/wordpress/index.php/second-life-educators-and-teens/">useful starting point</a> for reviewing some of the educational events that have already taken place in SL a bit further.)</p>

<!--
<p>Stephen Downes has just <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=34789">posted</a> a link to <a href="http://tim.lauer.name/archives/004733.html">this demo</a> of how "Google Maps has added the ability to overlay information files created in the Google Earth format", which is something I'm going to have to try out.... But it also reminds me about the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhoiem/projects/popup/index.html">Popup project</a> I came across the other other day which I haven't had a chance to explore yet, but the idea of which got me really excited...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhoiem/projects/popup/index.html">Popup Project</a>, created by Derek Hoiem (et al. (?)) at CMU, <em>automatically constructs simple "pop-up" 3D models, like those one would find in a children's book, out of a single outdoor image</em> (i.e. a photograph). (There's a write-up from last year's ACM Sigraph about it <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhoiem/publications/popup.pdf">here</a>.) The 3D model is provided as a VRML file.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhoiem/projects/popup/CMU.gif" alt="popup image" /></p>

<p>[UPDATE (16/4/07): it looks like pop-up is at the heart of a new online service, <a href="http://fotowoosh.com/">fotowoosh</a>, that will take your photos and create 3D VRML models from them.]</p>

<p>As I stumbled across this just before a dog walk, it was natural for me to idle awhile on the popup project as we went trudging through the woods (the bluebells have all gone now:-( And the idea that fired me up was how neat it would be if you could take an outdoor photograph, run it through the popup engine, generate a VRML file and somehow import this into <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>.</p>

<p>Now I know from Google's acquisition last year (?) of <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Sketchup</a> ("a simple but powerful tool for quickly and easily creating, viewing and modifying your 3D ideas") that it's possible to create 3D designs and import them into Google Earth. But I don't think I've ever seen mention of a VRML import option into that environment, which could be a problem...</p>

<p><img src="http://sketchup.google.com/images/SC_Free.jpg" alt="Google sketchup image" /></p>

<p>Anyway, I did a bit of digging and turned up one <a href="http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/cis2.html#SKETCHUP">interesting looking possibility</a>: <em>The Google SketchUp model was created by translating the CIS/2 file to VRML. The VRML was converted to DXF with <a href="http://www.righthemisphere.com/products/dexp/">Deep Exploration</a>  and then imported to Google Sketchup</em>.</p>

<p>Ah - so maybe there is a way.. Can  you imagine just imagine it - taking an outdoor photo of a building, chug chug clunk clunk computing with it for a bit, and then importing it as a 3D model into Google Earth ;-) (Yes,yes, I know it wont be that simple, and the conversion routines probably won't respect each other properly, but can you imagine it?:-)</p>

<p>[UPDATE 10/10/07: drip, drip, drip... <a href="http://www.news.com/Google-tools-to-power-virtual-worlds/2100-1043_3-6212325.html">SketchUp warehouse items will soon be available in Multiverse environments</a>]</p>

<p>I wonder too if any of the online gaming environments like <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> can import VRML files directly...;-)</p>

<p>PS Deep Exploration has a 30 day free trial/download offer, and I've managed to get hold of a Matlab runtime environment so I can run the Popup code, so maybe if I get a spare day or two (to allow for problem time!) I'll try and get the packages running together and have a play...</p>

<!--
<p>A new mailing list (<a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mailing-lists/ngc4lib/">NGC4Lib - Next Generation Catalogs for Libraries</a>) has just started up and already some intersting things are appearing on it. Take this bookshelf browser, for instance, at <a href="http://demo.gapines.org/opac/en-US/skin/default/xml/cnbrowse.xml?cn=j">Georgia Library (PINES)</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryShelfBrowser.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryShelfBrowser.jpg" width="664" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking on a book title gives a clear and informative record for it, as you might expect:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryPINESRecord.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryPINESRecord.jpg" width="659" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p>as well as a link to a bookshelf for the book author:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryShelfAuthor.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryShelfAuthor.jpg" width="588" height="503" border="0" /></p>

<p>This would be a really neat interface to the <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">Personal Bookshelf, I think.</a>. It would also be great interface to our Library's new stock (which is <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">available as a feed</a>).... or as an interface to my Amazon wishlist.</p>

<p>I've been looking for some reason to explore this really neat idea for <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2006/05/consuming-amazons-web-api-directly.html">Consuming Amazon's Web API Directly with Javascript (via JSON and XSLT)</a>, and maybe a wishlist bookshel is it?</p>

<p>Similar in feel is <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com">Blogbridge</a>, an online feed directory. The model seems to resemble the sorts of reading lists you might find at <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/home.do">H20 Playlist</a> or <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a>, although the focus at Blogbridge is solely on organising feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="blogbridgeMain.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/blogbridgeMain.jpg" width="543" height="480" border="0" /></p>

<p>Each topic has it's own page too, of course...</p>

<p><img alt="blogbridgeTopic.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/blogbridgeTopic.jpg" width="419" height="351" border="0" /></p>

<p>My first thought was that this would be one way of trying to organise/present/manage a directory of feeds that are starting to appear around the OU, as well as providing a suitable spot to host links to internal and external bloggers, but when the Blogbridge meme mixes withthe Library Bookshelf, another alternative presents itself...<br />
 <br />
For example, how about using the Blogbridge interface as a model for an online <em>Journal</em> bookshelf (i.e. an online <em>magazine rack</em>), where the  feed links to the table of contents, say, of a particular journal, and the screenshot is a picture of the journal cover.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways of doing this of course - a 'current titles' shelf, with a 'copy' of the most recent edition of each journal, or shelves dedicated to particular journals (i.e. containing an archive of a particular journal) and so on.</p>

<p>Direct linking to full text of articles for open access content would be easy enough to set up, butwWhat would be really handy would be if the feeds for subscription journals could also be set up to link through your local OpenURL resolver to subscription/full text versions of each article. </p>

<p>Would this qualify as a <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> entry, I wonder?</p>

<!--
<p>At the moment, I'm in the middle of making a series of posts about PLEs, but the narrative I wanted to develop on this topic is getting severely distorted with the wayward order in which I'm making the postings. So just to add to the confusion, here's another out of order piece...</p>

<p>My feeling about PLEs (to be fully articulated in a fuuture post) is that whatever they are, they will have online and offline components. When I describe this to people, the example I use is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006020.html">PodNova</a> which has online and desktop client components: an online management tool where I can subscribe to new podcasts and manage my podcast subscriptions, and an offline client, wherer I can download podcasts (as well as manage subscriptions).</p>

<p>If you are using multiple clients (rather than a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">portable client</a>) then the problem of tuning your client environment so that it is consistent across clients is a significant one...</p>

<p>...unlike accessing the same web site from a variety of clients, where you would expect to see the same website, with the most recent interaction history respected (except in the case of crossing between desktop and mobile browsers/clients, in which case you might expect the sasme website to behave differently depending on your access device).</p>

<p>Until now, that is. The <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a> extension for Fireox promises:</p>

<blockquote>Google Browser Sync for Firefox is an extension that continuously synchronizes your browser settings – including bookmarks, history, persistent cookies, and saved passwords – across your computers.</blockquote>

<p>There are potentially huge security issues, of course:</p>

<blockquote>Browser Sync keeps all your browsers in sync with each other, so it needs to send potentially sensitive information like your stored passwords, bookmarks, and browser history to the other computers where you've installed it. Also, once you install Browser Sync, you don't need to log in every time you start the browser to access this info. Therefore, someone who uses a computer where you've installed browser sync will have access to all the info you've chosen to sync across your computers. Any new browser settings they create, such as browsing history, will also show up on your other computers.</blockquote> 

<p>The idea that all my clients - indeed all my machines - can be accessed, searched and synched via the network, is one that seems to have momentum at the moment.</p>

<p>For example, Google Desktop search will <a href="http://desktop.google.com/features.html#searchremote">search across all my desktops</a> via a Google centralised directory of the holdings of my machines:</p>

<blockquote>share your indexed files between your computers, we securely transmit this content to Google Desktop servers located at Google.</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft also offer related propositions in the form of <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/">Foldershare</a> ("create a private peer-to-peer network that will help you to synchronize files across multiple devices and access or share files") and maybe also in the forthcoming <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/livesearch/windowslivesearch/">Windows Live Desktop Search</a> application...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.foldershare.com">FolderShare</a> is now integrated in the new release of <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/overview">Windows Live Messenger</a>, along with VOIP and video chat. Niall Kennedy hints <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/06/windows-live-messenger.html">interoperability with Yahoo! Messenger</a> will be in the next release. Meanwhile, Yahoo! have just announced support for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/messenger/">plug-ins for Yahoo! Messenger</a>. Exciting times...</p>

<p>(Hmm - Foldershare would be one way of allowing students to synch files across tutor or project groups...how dangerous would that be?! Could this also be a way of getting content from OU servers to students desktops, cf. an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005516.html">OU downloader/updater</a> )</p>

<!--
<p>I've mentioned a couple of time how I attended three separate PLE related event over the last couple of weeks: a talk at the OU by Stephen Downes, and a couple of CETIS events on PLEs. Here at last is a summary (in note form) of the things I took away from the first of these...</p>

<p><strong>Stephen Downes - <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=29&whichevent=798">The Students Own Education</a></strong> [the lack of an apostrophe is deliberate...]</p>

<p>Prelude - the changing nature of identity.<br />
<em>Before</em> - identity as belonging, part of something.<br />
<em>After</em> - identity a creation, as a set of connections:  "I am defined in part by my relationships and creations." [How does this tie in with the idea of social networks and online created identities (e.g. Bebo or MySpace?)? How could <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/index.php/Connectivist_Learning_Theory_-_Siemens">connectivist learning</a> draw on these personal social constructions for educational benefit?]</p>

<p><em>Today at the Institution....</em><br />
Student belongs to us, logs in to our VLE, navigates according to course structures in OU context.<br />
Student generated content is on OU server.</p>

<p>But increasingly questions of 'who owns this'? [This is really important for us, I think, where we encourage students to participate in online conversations/conferences. If the students were in an informal seminar, they may take notes. If they are typing into an electronic conference, they don't need to take notes because they are communicating via notes. The difference is, the notes expire when the conferences expire (or at least, lock out the students) shortly after the end of the course. If we get stdent to blog and contribute to wikis. will they have access to that content at the end of the course? at the end of their OU degree/relationship?]</p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/">Brian Lamb</a>, in a talk ?somewhen/where?, mentioned offering students wikis - but they said <em>'no thanks, we have one, outside'.</em></p>

<p>Work needs to belong to learner in a meaningful way for them to care enough to practice. The learner is in control.</p>

<p>What's happening out there - the net generation is creating its own media, it's own content.</p>

<p>e.g. MySpace - identity is dynamically created. Blogs and wikis. Wikipedia. Photos, podcasting, vodcasting, YouTube:<br />
 <br />
[interesting: youtube.com on OU campus - <br />
<em>"Access Denied<br />
Access to http://www.youtube.com/ has been restricted as it is in the pornography category.<br />
If you require assistance please contact your ITSP or, if you are using the public access terminals in the Library, Library Customer Service."</em><br />
That's the first time I've seen on e f thse notices before...<br />
]</p>

<p>From LMS to PLE:<br />
<a href="http://octette.cs.man.ac.uk/jitt/index.php/Personal_Learning_Environments">PLEs</a></p>

<p>PLE lends itself towards an exploratory form of learning. </p>

<p><img src="http://octette.cs.man.ac.uk/jitt/images/b/ba/Wilson_future_PLE.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="www.downes.ca/mygluframe.htm">MyGlu</a>: aggregator with built in filtering using regular expressions. [cf. <a href="http://suprglu.com">SuprGlu</a>]</p>

<p>SD's thoughts on a content creation tool/candidate functionality for a PLE: <a href="http://www.downes.ca/editor/writr.htm">RSS writr</a>: content pane for viewing content, editing pane for creating content, opportunity to upload content (description <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=33281">here</a>).</p>

<p>[I sort of get this in my extended browser anyway - <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> with the <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Performancing for Firefox (PFF)</a> blogging/note taking extension;  <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> actually has these things built in (<s>due out in Beat any time</s> <em>now out in Beta</em>)]</p>

<p><a href="http://elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=29-1">Elearning 2.0</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The model of e-learning as being a type of content, produced by publishers, organized and structured into courses, and consumed by students, is turned on its head. Insofar as there is content, it is used rather than read and is, in any case, more likely to be produced by students than courseware authors. And insofar as there is structure, it is more likely to resemble a language or a conversation rather than a book or a manual.</blockquote></p>

<p>Reading is the first part of <em>working with</em> content.</p>

<p>Some advantages of PLEs:<br />
 - persistence;<br />
 - identity; multiple identities on multiple systems. <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a> only federates across HE sector. PLE offeres possiblity of ditributed identity self-identified by me to other institutions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downes.ca/midm.htm">mIDm</a> (my - dee -me?) - identity essentially equivalent to a URL. </p>

<blockquote>what mIDm is not is an authentication service. That is, websites have to take the user's word that they are who they say they are. But what it does do is to provide any user who wants it with a unique identity.
...
The proposal is dead simple.

<p>You - a web user - create a website on which you create a program you can log in to (you don't have to do this yourself - you could use a program someone else created to do the same job - but the point is, you could do it yourself.</p>

<p>You then place the address of that program - its URL - into your browser.</p>

<p>Then, any time you go to a website, if that website wants to know who you are, it gets the URL from your browser and sends a request to the program. "Who is this?" the website will ask. "This is me!" the program will reply.</p>

<p>How does the website know that you've sent it to your program, and not someone else's? The same way Feedster or Technorati or Blogshares allows you to 'claim' a blog. It gives you a little bit of code which you then place into your program. Because you have to log into the program, only you could have placed the information there. So once the website gets the little bit of code back from the program, it is satisfied that you, indeed, are the person described by this program.</blockquote></p>

<p>[ cf. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005707.html">OpenClickin</a> ;-)]</p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://yadis.org/wiki/Main_Page">YADIS</a>. </p>

<p>Increasingly likely to see students authoring and repurposing learning resources - which means that need a way of managing digital rights.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.downes.ca/dwiki/?id=DDRM">http://www.downes.ca/dwiki/?id=DDRM</a> - need to find a way of readily supporting creation of rights metadata.</p>

<p>Do we need a PLE at all?<br />
"The PLE is an approach not an application."<br />
The student's application need not be a learning specific application - it may be (should be?) a general application. [Yes - e.g. students may use their own email client, wordprocessor, web browser, feed reader etc. <em> if they want</em>. We probably do nee to have an institutional environment for people who want it, but these should also support protocols that let students use their own clients if they want to...]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downes.ca/files/resource_profiles.htm">Resource profiles</a> [need to read this - didn't really grok the message here...]</p>

<p>PLE not simply allow you to read and write content but also allows you to create different sorts of metadata e.g. microformats. Leads to self-organising content, connected by relations based on how the content is used -> <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=46">semantic social network</a>. [structured blogging? What forms of structured blogging would make sense in an educational blogging environment? Does <a href="http://edupress.mrbelshaw.co.uk/?page_id=7">EduPress</a> have <em>educationally oriented structured blogging</em> built in?]</p>

<p>Q: PLEs to date seem to be about creating persistence. Are you a fan a building an environment?<br />
A: why would I want to keep stuff on my desktop? [I actually think there is something to be said for having local copies of content, as suggested by the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005515.html">Portable PLE/USB Study Stick</a> idea, which I need to develop a bit more, I think...]</p>

<p>SBS - seem to be talking about a  personal infomation management system. The learning is then mediated around the content that is being provided to me [surely the agenda with which the content arrives?]</p>

<p>A: Learning resource is only a learning resource when it is being used for learning.</p>

<p>PIM becomes PLE when it is used for learning, and it becomes learning when the content is used in a learning process.</p>

<p>Q: SD seems to be advocating a PLE is a universal client that can be used in learning activities.</p>

<p>A: PLE is an intermediate step. SD is interested in how info flows, how it gets metadata added, how it gets used, reused, remixed.</p>

<p>MW - is there a social dimension to the RSS Writr PLE?<br />
SD - yes, encompassed in the content that is pulled into the left-hand panel [this is e.g. a feed reader component; I guess there would be scope for a more generic client there, e.g. like <a href="http://www.bitty.com/">Bitty Browser</a>]</p>

<p>Can't force everyone to use the same tool outside the single institutional environment.</p>

<p>PLE goes outside the closed restrictive environment - that's the whole point.</p>

<p>MW - by using an institutional, single technology solution we don't have the interoperability problems.</p>

<p>SD - that's thinking within the single instituion model. And that's the thing that's changing.<br />
A PLE is a set of capacities, not a single thing.</p>

Yesterday, I made a blog post fom the Flock blogging tool in which I pasted a screenshot image into the blogging tool, let Flock upload it to flickr for me, and then let it paste the link to the image (now on Flickr) into the blog post. (It actually pasted it in with a link back to Flock which I deleted.)

Just because, I had a quick scout around to see what flickr's policy was towards non-photo images... and it may be an issue for me, if this article from Wired is anything to go by: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71119-0.html?tw=rss.index">flickr Cracks Down on Screenshots</a>. Because the use I'd have for flickr as a Flock blogging integrated service would be solely as a host for screenshots.<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71119-0.html?tw=rss.index"></a>

Deleting the link back to flickr was also a breach of their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/guidelines.gne">Community Guidelines</a>:

<blockquote>... pages on other websites that display images hosted on flickr.com must provide a link back to Flickr from each photo to its photo page on Flickr.</blockquote><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags:<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/flock" rel="tag">flock</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/flickr" rel="tag">flickr</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p>

[Problems with a slow server meant this post was originally posted several times as I misintepreted a Flock error message...]

<p>The <a href="http://flock.com">Flock browser is now available in beta</a>...</p>

<p>With full <a href="http://www.flock.com/tour/blogging">blogging integration</a> (I'm writing this post in the Blog Post tool, which supports wysiwyg or code views), <a href="http://www.flock.com/tour/photos">photoservice integration</a> (flickr, photobucket), <a href="http://www.flock.com/tour/news">feed reader</a> (fully integrated with feed autodetection), <a href="http://www.flock.com/tour/favorites">bookmark service integration</a> (delicios and shadows), enhanced <a href="http://www.flock.com/tour/search">search</a> (live search over local favourites, history and your search engine of preference) and an in-built notepad(drag text or images to it for later use), this is a seriously neat browser:-)</p>

<p><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g202/psychemedia/th_moz-screenshot.jpg" /></p>

<p>The photo-integration/photo-publishing is particularly clever. I pasted a clipboard copy of the above image in the blog tool and the browser uploaded it for me to my photo-sharing service account, then dropped the link to the image in to the post.</p>

<p>This integrated content consumind <i>and </i>content publishing environemnt is just the sort of thing that was being talked about at last week's CETIS PLE events (and also in <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=29&amp;whichevent=798">Stephen Downe's talk here at the OU</a>) [I've still to blog my thoughts about these.]</p>

<p>In particular, during those events, Stephen gave a quick demo of <a href="http://www.downes.ca/editor/writr.htm">writr</a>, a minmal (and very effective) browser based authoring environment, and <a href="http://www.cetis.ac.uk/members/scott">Scott Wilson</a> demoed Plex a couple of times (I reviewed it briefly <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006023.html">here</a>, but now I've seen what it can do, I think I need to revisit it).</p>

<p>I wonder how well a FLock demo would have gone down too???? More on Flock when I've had a chance to play with it a bit more...<br/>
</p>

<strong>PS</strong> There's a good review of Flock's new features over at <a href="http://www.solutionwatch.com/441/whats-new-with-flock/">Solution Watch</a>.

<h3 class="title">Using Educational Institutional Blogs to Raise "Brand Awareness"</h3>

Whilst this blog is very definitely not part of the official OU communications machinery, it does have the potential act as a communications channel for OU news and information that might also be of interest to external readers. One thing...
<!--
<p>Whilst this blog is very definitely <em>not</em> part of the official OU communications machinery, it does have the potential act as a communications channel for OU news and information that might also be of interest to external readers.</p>

<p>One thing I've started to aks myself is how the OU can start to make use of these channels for raising brand awareness, and perhaps even targeted advertising (just to raise the question, nothing sinister ;-)</p>

<p>For example, the OU has a close relationship with the BBC and co-produces many high profile broadcast offerings - <a href="http://www.open2.net/roughscience/">Rough Science</a>, for example, and <a href="http://www.open2.net/coast/index.html">Coast</a> to name but two. (For a more complete listing, visit the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> website.)</p>

<p>Should I be dropping mention of forthcoming progammes, with links to the relevant website, for example (like when the <a href="http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=30611&jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&sessionID=-1150150325699&entityName=object">Money programme did Search/Google</a>?)</p>

<p>And then there are the employment opportunites. As with any large organisation, there is a always steady trickle of current appointments/job ads, some of which are likely to be of interest to readers. For example, at the moment there are these posts open:<br />
<hr /><br />
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2388">Strategic Systems IT Development Manager, The Open University Library</a><br />
<em>Do you have the strategic vision to lead the development of leading edge systems and services to meet the needs of our users in a rapidly changing learning/technological environment?</p>

<p>You will lead the Library’s strategic IT systems development by providing specialist technical advice to Senior Management. You will ensure that there is a strategic fit with University-wide systems developments by liaising with key stakeholders in the organisation as well as horizon scanning new technologies and relevant research. You will support the development of our user-centred electronic library and its integration into the University’s virtual learning environment.</em><br />
<hr /><br />
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2366&ref=ext">Communications Manager (Open Content and Web Projects), Communications</a><br />
<em>The Open University revolutionised learning. Our Open Content Initiative (OCI) will make educational resources freely available on the Internet, with state of the art learning support and collaboration tools to connect learners and educators. We are looking for an experienced and creative individual to join the OCI team, managing online communications with key stakeholders and developing and implementing the communications plan. We are particularly looking for someone comfortable and familiar with all web technologies.</p>

<p>You will work as a full-time dedicated member of the Open Content Initiative Management Team but will be based within The Open University’s Communications unit. This means you will be able to draw on existing OU expertise in media relations and web developments (including SEO).</em><br />
<hr /><br />
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2364&ref=ext">Developers / Graduate Trainee Developers, Computing Services, Systems Development</a><br />
<em>We are looking for enthusiastic developers to work on a variety of system developments in the University’s central Computing Services department. Current projects include implementation of Siebel CRM software, the development of staff and student portals and electronic assessment tools.</em><br />
<hr /><br />
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2365&ref=ext">Systems Programmers / Graduate Trainee Systems Programmer, Computing Services, Technical Services</a><br />
<em>We are looking for bright, self-motivated professionals to work in a team responsible for Distributed Computing Infrastructure Systems, providing network, server and desktop services to staff. The team operates in a mixed environment which is constantly evolving and you should be flexible and able to adapt to new technologies.</em><br />
<hr /><br />
(If you apply, please mention where you first saw the ad on the OUseful blog!;-)</p>

<p>As far as I know, the job ads pages were some of the first OU pages to offer RSS feeds (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/rss-jobs.asp">OU current vacancies feed</a>). Was this driven by external drivers I wonder? Is the jobs market/recruitment industry hot on feeds? (Hmm  - I need to check out that feed again to see if they are using any semantic markup to really make the most of the feed medium. Is there any standard RDF for marking up job ads, I wonder?)</p>

<p>We're also large enough to have a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/">media relations/press office</a> that puts out one or two news releases a week (they even have an <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/sesame/ounewsrss.aspx">OU news wire</a> (i.e. RSS feed)).</p>

<p>And then there are our courses - not just for undergrads (like the entry level <a href="htt://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t183">Design for the Web Course</a>, or the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">Web ApplicationsCertificate</a>) or postgrads (like the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C02">Computing for Commerce and Industry (CCI)</a> Diploma/Masters programme), but also increasingly in the area of short <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/for-business/">CPD</a> courses. </p>

<p>One of the things I've started to think about is how I'd feel (and how the readership would feel) if banner ads for courses, BBC/OU programmes etc. were (very occasionally) inserted at the bottom of a post by the system (you'll notice perhaps I blog from a site rooted on <em>http://blogs.open.ac.uk</em>).</p>

<p>And finally, there is informal 'consultancy'. One of the extra-curricular things I do as  well as this blog is to help run the <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk">OU Robotics Outreach Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.robofesta-uk.org">RoboFesta-UK</a> website (this latter site generates around 15, 000 page impressions a month, and carries a couple of rotating OU short course banner ads).</p>

<p>The group has been around for about 5 years now and is increasingly approached for information and advice about organising robotics related outreach events. One thing I've started to think about is whether we should be askig people to link back to our site from their pages via a small 'OU-ROG Consulting' (!) or 'In association with RoboFesta-UK' graphic when we do provide them with advice.</p>

<p>Why I should <em>want</em> to do this OU promotion stiff via the blog is perhaps not obvious <em>unless</em> you have had some sort of involement with the OU. For all its faults, most people who work there are passionate about the OU Mission (even in the face of creeping corporatisation). The OU does good stuff and we're proud of it:-)</p>

<p>I do wonder how I (and you, dear reader...) would feel if OU related banners appeared at the end of every 10th post, say, with something relevant to the blog buit very obviously OU advertising related. Would it compromise the nature of the blog? Or would it in a sense add value by providing targeted OU related news to a well defined niche audience? (answers <s>on the back of a postcard</s> via the comments...)</p>

<p>Anyway - "normal" ad-free service will resume next post...;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Finding DOIs</h3>

I like the idea of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) a lot, and have written about them several times but one thing that bothers me is that they're not always given for an article, even if they exist. Take this search...
<!--
<p>I like the idea of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) a lot, and have written about them <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=%22digital%20object%22&amp;IncludeBlogs=1149">several times</a> but one thing that bothers me is that they're not always given for an article, even if they exist.</p>

<p>Take this <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=openurl+resolution">search on Google Scholar for <em>openurl+resolution</em></a>, for example. The first hit is given as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="gsSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gsSearch.jpg" border="0" height="221" width="722" /></p>

<p>Now, the results show that this article is available from several locations (<em>group of 7</em>), which may be handy; and if I want the full reference of any particular instance, I can have it, for example as a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:-D8HR5_q5SUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=citation&amp;oe=ASCII&amp;oi=citation">BibTeX record</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="bibtex.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bibtex.jpg" border="0" height="151" width="767" /></p>

<p>But what I'd really like is a DOI listed in the results too...</p>

<p>At this point it's perhaps worth noting that Google Scholar knows how to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+doi%3A10.1045%2Fmarch2001-vandesompel&amp;btnG=Search">resolve DOIs from the search box</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="googleScholarDOIResolution.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleScholarDOIResolution.jpg" border="0" height="265" width="724" /></p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> have a <a href="http://www.crossref.org/guestquery/">free DOI lookup</a> service which looks like it might do the business:</p>

<p><img alt="crossRefDOILookup.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/crossRefDOILookup.jpg" border="0" height="383" width="623" /></p>

<p>So on my to do list then (unless Google beat me to it) is for starters a script that will take a BibTeX reference, chuck it into a CrossRef DOI lookup form, pull out the DOI (if there is one), and squirt it back into the Google results page...</p>

<p>PS I wonder - would it be handy to build a tool that also creates OpenURL and COinS data from the BibTeX info too? </p>

<p>For example, there's this <a href="http://generator.ocoins.info/">COinS Generator</a> which takes similar info and generates <a href="">COinS HTML snippets</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="coinsGenerator.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/coinsGenerator.jpg" width="608" height="566" border="0" /><br />
 <br />
And plenty of <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/sfx_openurl.htm">OpenURL</a> generators, like <a href="http://library.ucf.edu/Presentations/2004/OpenURLChoices/SFXpages/OpenURLGenerator.html">this one</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="openURLgenerator.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openURLgenerator.jpg" width="617" height="522" border="0" /></p>

<p>PPS I really need to get my head around the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation-formats">wide variety of citation formats</a>.</p>

<p>PPPS <a href="http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/?p=60">this</a> looks interesting and worth tracking...:<br />
<blockquote>here are some thoughts on a way of meshing unAPI and COinS to enable interesting uses of bibliographic metadata in web pages</blockquote></p>

<p>The following are my raw notes form the VC's Global Online University forum held earlier this week.</p>

<p>I haven't had time, and probably won't have time <a href="http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/">;-)</a> to go through these for a week or two to try and make sense of them, so here they are, in all their glory.</p>

<p>For OU staff, I think the talks are replayable in the <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">Berrill Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>-----------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Heppell</strong></p>

<p><br />
1996 - building big things<br />
2006 - Build things to help people to help each other</p>

<p>Lots of online essay-to-order websites, degrees for purchase, etc.</p>

<p>OU is about people:<br />
Originally - if you hate your job we'll help you get out of it. <br />
Now, if you love your job, we'll help you progress in it.</p>

<p>Communities of practise</p>

<p>21st century quality assurance</p>

<p>Global Online University is already here:<br />
high quality discourse, communities of (learning) practice, topic centred, project focussed  - gave example of online communities set up to discuss stratgey and tactics in run up to Round the Isalnd boat race.</p>

<p>a) do we want to be part of it?<br />
b) what are we contributing?<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Downes</strong></p>

<p>Should there be a global online university?</p>

<p>SD's visit here sandwiched between blog.ac.uk (personal publishing) and CETIS PLE event (PLEs created and owned by student, rather than a a particular institution).</p>

<p>Global - probably not.</p>

<p>Move towards distributed, decentralised network in which indivual are nodes and commincation links them together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain manifesto</a> - markets are changing from client-server model to a conversation. Consumers are involved in production of product.</p>

<p>Fishing rod tutor - buy a new fishing rod, try it out, the fishing rod says "you haven't fished before" and proceeds to instruct you. Learning travels with the environment or the artefact. Learning resources are part of background environment.</p>

<p>Web users starting to produce their own content/resource. With syndication(?), it starts to become an online educational resource.</p>

<p>Spontaneous online communities - common interest, background knowldge and expertise, ability and inclination to communicate - e.g. beekeeper group on Yahoo! groups.</p>

<p>This is the way of the future.</p>

<p>(Metauniversity/Charles Vest)</p>

<p>Four factors for network success:<br />
- diversity;<br />
- openness;<br />
- connectedness;<br />
- interaction/community.<br />
----------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - George Auckland, BBC</strong></p>

<p>Learn to let go - but really connect.</p>

<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/YoungGirl-OldWomanIllusion.html">Old lady/young woman illusion</a>:</p>

<p>BBC Education originally - old woman - started 1920s.</p>

<p>By 1928, realised learning needed to go beyond just broadcast.</p>

<p>Audiences are now changing: 1 in 3 don't think BBC makes programmes for them, 1 in 4 16-24 don't watch BBC. BUT GCSE Bitesize has 800, 000 userrs at this (revision) time of year.</p>

<p>Explosion of mdeia choice; move to on-demand viewing.</p>

<p>Need to realise full potential of any piece of content, exploit long tail: almost opposite of traditional broadcast model (large audience at time of broadcast).</p>

<p>360 degree exploitation:<br />
big wraparound of national broadcast - local broadcast, web sites, packs etc.</p>

<p>Big Ambition - all content available forever to be re-discovered, linked, clipped, built into other ideas.</p>

<p>How do you develop the brand with open source/content licensing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/create/">BBC Create</a><br />
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/archive/">BBC Open Schools Archive</a></p>

<p>IP is based on 'good ideas are hard to find' (Joe Kraus)  - is this still true? Has current IPR model had its day?</p>

<p>BBC has biggest/finest boradcast archibe in the world - the OU must have the HE equivalent.</p>

<p>Learn to let go of the content, but connect with the audience.</p>

<p>------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Yahoo! Research (pre-recorded video presentation)</strong></p>

<p>Important issues of web today are social networks, trust, reputation.</p>

<p>Social netowrking just one example of how net is self-organising to cope with growth of web.</p>

<p>Dealing with change is maybe main challenge of Yahoo today.</p>

<p>We don't know how the web will evolve, nor ways of accessing it.</p>

<p>TV had potential to become a force in education, but it has arguably, largely drifted away from that. Hopefully, the web will not evolve in the same way.</p>

<p>Content should not only be open, it should also be discoverable.</p>

<p>Difference between 'free' and 'open'.</p>

<p>To date, advertising has been dominant commercial model. ROI on advertising is measureable by measuring click-thru and consequrent purchase (opens up potential for affiliate based business models (e.g. Amazon Associates) as well as advertising).</p>

<p>--------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Malcolm Ross, Merlin Consulting</strong></p>

<p>Mobile/telecoms consultancy.</p>

<p>Telecoms scenarios for 2020 and potential impact on the way the OU operates as a business.</p>

<p>Telecoms tech: ICT is delivery enabler for HE. Effectively no performance limits on what is achievable.</p>

<p>Moore's law, Kryder's law (hard disk capacity), Gilder's law (bandwidth).</p>

<p>Morita - if you set a low enough size and cost point for a product someone will manage it.</p>

<p>Most thought should focus on areas where uncertainty is highest and impact on the current business model is biggest.</p>

<p>2D map - impact on one acces, uncertainty on another. Scenario planning has high imapct, high uncertainty focus.</p>

<p>Four basic scenarios based on supply and demand developments (2 axes again):</p>

<p>Supply - few gloabl players to many/everyone can do it.<br />
Demand - simple, generic, free to custom</p>

<p>Shouldn't try to predict an accepted future, rather come up with strategies that are robust for any mix of likely futures.</p>

<p>Robust strategies for 2020:<br />
- monetise staff, student and alumni; (linking people together for added value);<br />
- who's the teacher, who's the educator; leverage OU community as virtual consulting business;</p>

<p>?evolvability - imagine, create content, that may be sold but openly licensed. Other prope change the cotnent over time but its origin as my IPR is retained within metadata. In time, none of my original words are there, but I am still in metadata and still get some revenue when the content is sold. -> get returns for creating evolvable content.</p>

<p>=-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Werner Vogels, Amazon</strong></p>

<p>Digital Revolution:<br />
- the world is changing from hard to find knowledge/expert, to plentiful, reasliy available;<br />
- the changes are fundamental - personal expression, daily living, work and play, affecting culture, artistic expression, societal norms.</p>

<p>First phase of industrial revolution was mass production of steel. This was the enabler.<br />
In info revolution, still in phase 1.</p>

<p>Paradigm shift - <br />
business moving from monolith to ecosystem, move to platform, support customisatiomn (let users customise your business as they experience it); move from broadcast to viral, brochure to conversation; business moves from hierarchy to flat becuase information is becoming available to all.<br />
Amazon revolves around customer reviews.<br />
Customers have perfect information - if you aren;t to be trusted, customers will find out.<br />
Customers becoming sellers as well as buyers.<br />
Consumers moving from consumers to producers.</p>

<p><a href="http://istockphoto.com/index.php">iStockphoto</a> - killing traditional stock photo services.</p>

<p>We are still at day one. However:<br />
 - the internet is increasingly imprtant;<br />
 - for kids, thinjgs like Amazon have always been there. Information has always been completely available for them.</p>

<p>The kids will drive the second phase.</p>

<p>Info management skills will become ESSENTIAL.<br />
Understanding how things like reputation  (top hit on Google etc) are constructed.</p>

<p>---------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Michael Stevenson, DfES</strong></p>

<p>How might government see HE context wrt global online university.</p>

<p>Increased participation.</p>

<p>HE is a big business - so don't destabilise it. UK HE sector quite conservative.</p>

<p>90% of HEI are reliant on govt for at least 1/3 of funding. Resisting adoption of new technology - odd dabblings, but nothing revolutionary.<br />
BUT student body coming into HE with significant prior experience of online community and practice.</p>

<p>How do we unleash student demand further?<br />
How do we address financing?<br />
How do we get HEIs to collaborate?<br />
Greater role for private sector?<br />
How to engage employers?<br />
How to drive international expansion while protecting UK HE brand.</p>

<p>African educational development.<br />
Sustainable development.</p>

<p>Global online university would have to be built out of global partnerships - HE, IT companies (GYM etc.), content producers (e.g. BBC), cultural sectors.</p>

<p>Need for a business model (but impractical in developing world).</p>

<p>Should start with the greatest ambition but modest first steps.</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Riita Vanska, Nokia</strong></p>

<p>Use of mobile techniology in developing world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4126776">Bridge<em>it</em></a> - teachers order content via SMS, which is delivered overnight via satellite.<br />
<a href="http://mobiled.uiah.fi/?page_id=2">MobilED</a> - just utilising audio; audio connection to Wikipedia.<br />
(<a href="http://press.nokia.com/PR/200511/1021392_5.html">Village phone</a> - knowledge sharing)</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Svava Bjarnason, Observatory on Borderless Higher Education</strong></p>

<p>Why bother we a Global Online U?<br />
 - the context;<br />
 - the reality;<br />
 - the questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/">OBHE</a> - An International Strategic Info Service.<br />
- descriptive info;<br />
- strategic info.</p>

<p>Why GOU? - is it part of open content movement?<br />
 - capacity building in other countries?<br />
 - increasing student market?<br />
- building new research partnerships?</p>

<p>Online/tech is NOT ubiquitous. Connectivity is not available to all outside North America and Europe. In global context, English is not necessarily the dominant language.</p>

<p>Golbal HE - investment required, distribution of risk when working in partnership, balance of opportunity vs. strategy and/or tradition vs. innovation; need to be in long game for tangible results.</p>

<p>How global is global? Is China global on its own?</p>

<p>Is it wholly online or blended?<br />
Is it about altruism or is it market driven? (is this a necessary <em>or</em>, or is it a possible <em>and</em>?<br />
- partners - global or regional?)</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Alistair Shrimpton, Skype</strong></p>

<p>Skype want to enable the world's conversations.<br />
Skype perceive themselves as enablers - product development is key.<br />
Global product and global point of view.</p>

<p>One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.</p>

<p>Conversations are more than just about voice.</p>

<p>Cluetrain manifesto: 'markets are conversations'.</p>

<p>Skype - small company in terms of staff; 1% of users using paid for services keep it free for the rest (85% of whom don't realise paid for services are available).</p>

<p>Aim to make the hard look easy - hide the hard stuff from the user.</p>

<p>Skype champions privacy, very secure ('military grade' security).</p>

<p>Skype - built around extremely rapid innovation. Product development is what Skype do.</p>

<p>Locally disruptive. If you think something will happen, get their first...</p>

<p>Open APIs, active developer community.</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Chris Yapp, Microsoft</strong></p>

<p>"How can a global online university maximise the potential for good?"</p>

<p>So what's the challenge?</p>

<p>- the world is becoming increasingly project driven rather than insitutionally driven?</p>

<p>So identify the challenge, then work out what collaborations and partnerships are required to address the challenge.</p>

<p>Fundamental challenge appears to hooking up reserch that solves problems to people who need the knowledge via teaching of the research knowledge at all levels.</p>

<p>So - become a portal to global knowledge base.</p>

<p>Glolbal online knowledge bank exploited by GOU/teaching instituion to address fundamental challenges in maximising public good.</p>

<p>-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Q & A</strong></p>

<p>JC - radical business model change seems to be required, but what is the model for that?</p>

<p>VC - we have been thinking about business models for serveral years, but won;t be something to happen overnight. Need for largescale pilot.</p>

<p>WV - focus on core competencies and commoditise those. Play to your strengths. Amazon stength is playing at scale [as is OU]. Continue to do what you're good at but in new ways.</p>

<p>Can a transition from trad-business to e-business be evolutionary rather than evolutionary.<br />
VC - a step-change, switch from one model to the other would be hard to achieve. BUT difficult to maintain two business models (one old, one new) side-by-side.<br />
SH - we know HE has its problems, but if we don't fix it perhaps an upstart will (cf. Ryan Air) and their disruption may not be better.<br />
WV - who is the customer? are we really serving our customers, where offerings are ubiquitous, and it becomes possible to mix-and-match.<br />
SD - it is possible to be innovated out of existence. Need to ask why we are doing what we do, what the purpose/point is. OU is trying to accomplish a social value/goal.</p>

<p>MarcE - a fundamental change is happening but education typically doesn't grok it wholesale and may adopt technology bits piecemeal. How does HE go for it? Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time? <br />
SH - if you hit the tough targets, you've got it made. Size is everything. OU has the scale to make the play. 18 months to make the play. The curve is accelerating - it really is this time.<br />
WV - is a global university a desirable thing? If so, te online is almost a given.<br />
SD - Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time?  Because this time they are making laws against it, which suggests it is ubiquitous.<br />
MS - if it's to happen, 3 things required: 1) people need to come together; if GOU, it needs government and corporate support; maybe transformation over 10-15 yr period and when we look back it will have happened.<br />
CY - who isn't here? People like GSK who have to operate across regions, across skill sets etc.<br />
WV - arts and creative industries need representation.<br />
SB - there is momentum this time; many HE people investing in online learning to enhance campus experience NOT a global market. So - now may be the time when we could have first mover advantage towards  GOU.<br />
VC - common sense dictates we need to stop reinventing Physics 101, Maths 101 etc.</p>

<p>Does current funding model support the investement necessary to go wholesale for a new technology solution? What management structure can support this level of change?</p>

<p>AS - someone has got to just go and do it, and be disruptive. SHould 8 people from the panel go away, lock themselves in a room, and make a decision about what's gonna happen by the end of the week? Yes - absolutely.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>??]</p>

<p>WV - release early, release often.<br />
MR - with 1 million alumni and 200k students, the OU should turn itself into a business...<br />
CY - HE sector is likely to have individual institutions failing. HE has the desire to do everything in a vertical organisation. If you can't be world class in a particular area, get someone else to it.<br />
SD - what's the goal? To get everybody educated for free? SO ask the question: what do we need to do to move ourselves to wards that goal, or the goal of free education for everybody in the world.</p>

<p>[Google want to organise the world's knowledge; skype want to get evryone talking. Should we want to be striving for 'A free education for everyone' .]</p>

<p>SH - alumni are assets. and the OU has lots of alumni.<br />
MR - education has to be paid for by the future wealth it creates; cf. microcredit arrangements where the introduction of mobile phones increases the wealth of the village.</p>

<p>JN - two strands: 1) how to reinvent the OU; 2) does the idea of a Global University make sense? The idea of the OU metamorphosing into into a GOU make sense - no; a global oU would have to be a networked organisation and whilst the OU might be a seed crystal it can;t be the final thing.<br />
MR - the process of producing content is an important part of the seed corn contribution.<br />
SH - it may not be the OU who does this, but the alternative is scarey...the OU has quality process etc. etc and the alternatives don't necessarily have those built in in the way they are built in to the OU. <br />
WV - being first is hard. Being number 25 is easy- - it's just copying. To be first will be incredibly hard. Does global also mean delivering Polish content in UK?<br />
CY - Need to get the best brains here in an R&D centre to crack the problem.<br />
MS - the OU could and should have a role - the ethos, appreciation of the importance of partnership, etc. Need to pull in government becuase as well as cash, government IS influential.<br />
SD - it is unlikely for there to be a single thing that would be the GU. A GU is unlikely to be a content delivery vehicle. The model will be learning and community model, learning as conversation, or communities of practice model. Commercial focus is on product, but learning is about conversation not product.  </p>

<p>?? - How do academics as designers of learning experiences fit into the model? What are my job prospects?<br />
PM - Amazon is 24-7, whereas HE has scheduled start dates. How do we move to the 24-7 model?<br />
?? - radical change is proposed, but our current model is highly regarded? How do we avoid throwing the baby out with ithe bathwater? Should we start a new venture?</p>

<p>WV - digital stuff is not necessarily good, because it brings with it attention deficit, and difficulty in making decisions. Teachers may move away from being content producers to guides.<br />
CY - potential market that is currently poorly served is the over-50s.</p>
