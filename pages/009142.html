<h3 class="title">More OpenLearn RSS Feeds...</h3>

<p>A quick pointer to a handful of RSS feeds I've just generated from OpenLearn/<a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a> content. Quite a few of them have audio and flash movie resources in them which has raised a few interesting questions I'll post about later (already wasted enough of tonight on this palaver!). </p>

<p><s>It's too late just now for me to find the course titles, so you'll have to check out the feeds or look the courses up on LabSpace to see if there is anything that interests you... feel free to post the titles into a comment so I can just cut and paste them into a revision of this post.</s><br />

<p><s>(Okay then, some clues - the L course is French for Beginners, sort of; the B course is Marketing/Business; the S courses are on evolution, I think; the E courses are on the environment, maybe? The K course is something on healthcare, I think.)</s> - thanks for the titles above, Patrick;-)</p>

<p>Notes to self to post about another day:</p>

<p>- how to deal with crap (no other word for it) in the original XML; things like weird punctuation, or punctuation that has been encoded into something undecipherable. I think someone in the OpenLearn team needs to lock down exotic punctuation. The simple stylesheet I'm using gets confused by all but the simplest punctuation...</p>

<p>- some of the courses have no metadata at all, not even course title, which is (IMHO ;-) inexcusable.</p>

<p>- some of the courses may not always work sensibly as a feed using my literal "1 page=1 feed item" heuristic. For example, in the feedcycle regime, where a new item is delivered every day, the flow from one item into the next may break if the content has been chunked (paginated) so that one page sets up, and leads immediately into, the next.</p>

<p>- rather than make life easy using multimedia formats that everyone has their browser (and server) set up for, a lot of the multimedia resources I came across tonight use things like <em>flv</em> and <em>mp4</em> (rather than <em>swf</em> or <em>mpg</em>, for example). This led to an interesting diversion into potential embedded players (like this <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Video_Player">http://www.jeroenwijering.com/flv Flash video player</a>).</p>

<p>Although I'm sure a lot of OpenLearn/LabSpace decisions were taken for good reasons, it's obvious that no-one was really encouraged to play with (i.e. try to (re)use/(re)mix) any of this stuff at a file-format and document processing level while the architectural decisions were being made...</p>

<p>I'd said that was a big oops...</p>

<p>PS if anyone from the OpenLearn team is listening, am I allowed to put the movies etc. onto YouTube (from where it'll be easy to play with? ;-)</p>
