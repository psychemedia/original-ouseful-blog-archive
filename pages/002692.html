<h3 class="title">SSOL - Screencast Supported Open Learning?</h3>

<p>I just stumbled across an interesting piece on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html"> on the merits of screencasting</a>, written by uber blogger <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a>. Jon is one of screencasting's major proponents and the person who <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/15.html">asked the community</a> what <em>movies about software</em> should be called before adopting the neologism screencast after a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/15.html">community vote</a>.</p>

<p>If you're new to the idea of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">screencasts</a>, they're movies about how to drive a piece of software or use a website, narrated in real time by a "tutor" demonstrating a particular task. Screencasts tend to be quite informal, and the narrator occasionally notices - or realises - something new to them whlst producing the screencast.</p>

<p>As this <a href="http://www.extremepodcasting.com/screencasts/technorati.html<br />
">screencast on Technorati tags</a> shows, production values aren't necessarily that high, but the combination of narrated explanation and on-screen demonstration is potentially very powerful.</p>

<p>How do you go about creating a screencast? Once again, Udell comes to the rescue with a piece about <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html">making screencasts</a>. The two most popular ways at the moment appear to be to use Camtasia (a commercial screen capture package that oftne appears as a freebie on computer magazine cover-mounted CD-ROMs); or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows Media Encoder</a>, which I saw mentioned in this post about a <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/discuss/msgReader$3427">Wikipedia screencast</a> (which is well worth watching if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> is new to you...).</p>

<p>So - is this likely to be useful for the OU? I personally think there may be something in the use of screencasts  because they add to the learning mix for courses that need students to do taks on-screen. The informality of the screencast is possibly an issue in an age where we have replaced students with customers, but the OU pioneered the idea of a tutorial in print as a <em>friendly</em> instructional medium and I believe screencasts can be seen in the same spirit - as a represetnative of the course team sat by the side of the student and working though the material with them. </p>

<p>There are <em>issues</em>, of course...</p>

<p>- people's memory of what happened in the screencast is limited, so paper support may be necessary as backup. That said, I think that the paper instructions can be simplified if there is an animated visual aid;</p>

<p>- production quality is likely to be low if screencasts are made by an academic... but we do write quite informally at times when producing 'tutorials in print' and i think this may help personalise the CT-student relationship. Screencasts could perhaps be providd through online course conferences as an informal <em>additional</em> CT provided resource if the quality is not deemed to be of an acceptable standard for delibvery as fully qualified course material;</p>

<p>- during course production, screencasts may help the editor/QA check that print instructions actually mirror the on-screen actions we want the student to perform.</p>

<p>I hope to produce a few demo screencasts in the near future. It will be interesting to see whether or not they become an animated, on-screen adjunct to the tutorial-in-print.</p>
