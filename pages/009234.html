<h3 class="title">FOAFed at last...</h3>

<p>After seeing a blog post just over a week ago with a graphic demonstrating how to <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2007/01/21/reaching_at_least_600_000_people_with_19">reach at least 600 000 people with 19 contacts</a> via <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> (friend of a friend) connections, I thought I should get round to creating my own FOAF record.</p>

<p>A quick trawl of generators turned up things like <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">FOAF-a-Matic</a>, which I've come across several times before, and which generates a FOAF record from details you provide via a web form. It's then up to you to save this file and host it somewhere.</p>

<p>This is all very well, but what if I don't have anywhere to upload the FOAF record to?</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that I want to manage my identity - and things that relate to it - from a single, hosted service (albeit one that I can trust)?</p>

<p><a href="http://openid.net">OpenId</a> has been getting a lot of press lately (partly because of this <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/openid-screencast/">excellent screencast</a>) and I've been looking at it in the hope it can simplify cross-application working in StringLE. I've been playing with an account at <a href="http://www.myopenid.com">MyOpenID</a>, but it's pretty minimal, just offering OpenID services.</p>

<p><a href="http://idproxy.net/">idproxy.net</a> looks interesting too (I've only just come across it this minute) - this service lets you log in with a Yahoo Id using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/">Yahoo's authentication system/API</a>, and then provides OpenId services on top. <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html">Google also have an web app authentication API</a>, [5/2/07 - and there's now a <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=347">Microsoft passport/identity API</a> too][19/2/07 - and here's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/aol_openid.php">OpenID for AOL users</a>] ] so it'll be interesting to see if <em>idproxy</em> go on to incorporate this, and maybe become the Meebo of open identity systems?! (How much trust would you have to have in <em>that</em> service, I wonder?)</p>

<p>Anyway, it was gratifying to see a new service - <a href="http://videntity.org">videntity.org</a> - that provides OpenID hosting <em>as well as</em> FOAF management and vcard export.</p>

<p>The service is pretty basic at the moment - you can't yet usefully add a link to a friend's FOAF record, only their homepage - but I'm hopeful that the service will develop (automatically <a href="http://www.pingthesemanticweb.com/">pinging the semantic web</a> after every FOAF record update would be handy, I think?)</p>

<p>I've started tentatively, just adding a minimum of personal information and a couple of contacts, to a record stored at <a href="http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml">http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml</a>.</p>

<p>To browse the record, I've pinched a link I found on <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom">Tom Heath</a>'s site: <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http://psychemedia.videntity.org/foaf.xml">browse my FOAF record</a>.</p>

<p>Using a templated, hosted service potentially limits how comprehensive my FOAF record can be, of course (<a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom/about/rdf">Tom's FOAF record</a> shows just how wide a range of information the FOAF record can store). If I can't edit the FOAF file directly, I can't add fields to the FOAF record that aren't supported by the editing forms provided by the host.</p>

<p>That said, videntity.org does offer quite a range of form options:</p>

<p><img alt="videntity.png" src="./videntity.png" width="455" height="333" border="0" /></p>

<p>This service has a nice feature that lets you add new friends to your own FOAF record - sort of; click to add a friend, provide the URL of your current FOAF file, and it will generate you a new FOAF record containing the the details of your new friend (which you can then use to replace your old FOAF file).</p>

<p>What I'd really like to be able ot do, of course, is see the browser sort of functionality incorporated into something like videntity. </p>

<p>Only more so...</p>

<p>Here are two visual editors that would be useful in the context of FOAF management.</p>

<p>Firstly, a FOAF navigating equivalent of <a href="http://www.geni.com/">Geni</a>, the viral, visual family tree editor.<br />
(What happens when you get this service "interoperating" with FOAF family relationships, I wonder?!)</p>

<p>Secondly, this <a href="http://www.twoantennas.com/projects/delicious-network-explorer/">delicious network explorer</a> (thanks for the link, Mike:-):</p>

<p><img alt="deliciousExplorer.png" src="./deliciousExplorer.png" width="615" height="472" border="0" /></p>

<p>This tool lets you explore delicious networks. It also displays the number of delicious fans a user has, although this looser network is not browsable. [I wonder how hard it would be to feed my delicious network details into a FOAF manager and automatically have the members of my delicious network added to my FOAF record?]</p>

<p>(Just by the by, I wonder if anyone has built a 'degrees of separation' tool that identifies the connections between and two individuals with delicious users, or the delicious distance between a user and a given URL, or between two URLs?)</p>
