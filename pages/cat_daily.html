<p>Another daily service, this time a daily news bundle... this time, the <a href="http://my.dailyme.com/">Daily Me</a>...</p>

<p>Here's the schedule setting dialogue:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2387184889/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2387184889_a3b4332f36.jpg" alt="Daily Me scheduler" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="191" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The service doesn't appear to have a 'daily feed' shceduler that will provide daily instalments from a static feed (such as an OpenLearn unit content feed). So there's still time for me to get such a generic service first to market! Now I really must get round to wrting that internal 'bid' document for it... you ready, Patrick?! ;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/daily" rel="tag">daily</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Daily Book Feeds</h3>

I'm more and more convinced that regularly scheduled 'static' feeds are going to play an important, and effective, role in supporting informal learning. My own early experiments with daily feed have revolved around OpenLearn_daily, which will be undergoing a revamp...

<p>I'm more and more convinced that regularly scheduled 'static' feeds are going to play an important, and effective, role in supporting informal learning. My own early experiments with daily feed have revolved around <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009164.html">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, which will be undergoing a revamp just as soon as the OpenLearn unit content feeds start working properly (more on that later...).</p>

<p>(At the moment, OpenLearn<em>_daily</em> uses <a href="http://feedcycle.co.uk/">Feedcycle</a> to deliver the feeds, although I have also posted about a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010489.html">daily feed Yahoo pipe</a> which is far less hassle to set up!)</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the web, out-of-copyright books are starting to receive the daily feed treatment too, as <a href="http://www.dailylit.com/">Daily Lit</a> shows:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108516002092158434"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUYPOIaDeI/AAAAAAAAAko/IsdGi8_yjms/s800/dailylit1.png" /></a></p>

<p>As well as feed subscriptions, you can also choose to receive daily emails (which was the original motivation for the site, I think...).</p>

<p>Whilst no registration is required to receive a Daily Lit feed, it's still possible to defined your own personal delivery schedule:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108516006387125746"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUYPeIaDfI/AAAAAAAAAkw/zaS1q_DmMiw/s800/dailylit2.png" /></a></p>

<p>If you do register, however, more advanced subscription tools are available, such as the ability to <em>suspend</em> the delivery of feed items, or manage the delivery days for feed items as well as the number of items per installment (<em>normal</em> - 1 item per day, <em>longer</em> - 2 items per day, <em>longest</em> - 4 items per day).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108519588389850626"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUbf-IaDgI/AAAAAAAAAk8/XNLqejaVy4g/s800/dailylit3.png" /></a></p>

<p>[UPDATE: when you start to receive subscriptions, each daily item is delivered with a 'sponsored' link ("Buy this item from Amazon") and a list of adminsitrative links at the end of the post:<br />
    * Add next installment to feed right now<br />
    * Discuss with other readers in the forum<br />
    * Suspend this subscription<br />
    * Manage all your subscriptions<br />
<em>Add next installment to feed right now</em> is a particulary neat idea, although to actually benefit from tjhe extra item you also need to have some way of forcing your feedreader to refresh the feed immediately.]</p>

<p>Another nice feature is a "bookroll" that allows you to display a list of the books you are currently subscribed on your blog/social network profile pages. This is also the first inkling of how Daily Lit might be used to develop in the social networking direction itself...</p>

<p>It would be nice to see the Daily Lit platform develop further, even going so far as to allow (private?) subscriptions to user provided URLs.</p>
