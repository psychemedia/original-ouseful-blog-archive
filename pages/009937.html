<h3 class="title">Click Powered Predictions...?</h3>

<p>A week or two ago I posted about the possibility of <a href="./009726.html">Search Powered Predictions</a> in which I idled about whether might be able to make use of users' search behaviour to try and predict potentially popular new courses.</p>

<p>Today, I came across <a href="http://www.spotplex.com/">Spotplex</a>, which "provides internet users with real-time ranking of blog articles based on actual impression count".</p>

<p>Apparently, it works like this:<br />
<blockquote>1. A blogger inserts a Spotplex code into their blog.<br />
2. Whenever an article in the blog is read, the code reports Spotplex server that the article is read.<br />
3. The article shows up on Spotplex and the view counter reflects the change.</blockquote></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be good if we had an internal version of this running for course pages listed in the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/">OU Course catalogue</a>?</p>

<p>Or how about using page reads as implicit votes in a prediction market for the number of students likely to register on a particular course...</p>

<p>...because apparently students are leaving it later and later to register on our courses (I wonder if they are holding out for sale prices on the course fees? Although I guess if they're Tesco punters they could always use <a href="./009219.html">Tesco Clubcard vouchers as part payment for their OU course fees</a>?</p>

<p>With the post of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2902">Director, Learning & Teaching Solutions (LTS)</a> currently being advertised (<em>Salary negotiable</em>, apparently), I wonder just how different things would be internally if a 2.0 type was appointed?<br />
<blockquote>Employing 490 editors, graphic designers, web designers, audio-visual specialists and software developers, our Learning and Teaching Solutions is responsible for the production and delivery of all our learning materials. Under your direction, the unit will bring to life the creations of our academic specialists, delivering world class print material, CD ROMs, DVDs and web pages, plus cutting-edge Blogs, Wikis, ePortfolios and eAssessment engines to power our Virtual Learning Environment. This will involve constant liaison with academic Faculties and Schools, the Student Services division, the Library and our research institutes to keep us at the forefront of best practice.</p>

<p>To take on this exceptionally influential role, you will require considerable experience of producing distance learning media and deep understanding of new and evolving educational technologies. Joining us at a time of profound change, you will apply your imagination and expertise to shape the educational experiences of thousands of students around the world â€“ and build on our unrivalled reputation.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, the above is nothing to do with me (even more so than usual given the relative seniority of the post), but if you do apply etc etc <a href="./009723.html">normal rules apply</a> (except - as a finders fee - I'd also like 10% of the negotiated salary to buy me a developer for a week or two of agile development time (?!) ... ;-0)</p>
