<h3 class="title">Future Scenarios for University ICT TAL Strategies</h3>

<!--
<p>A year or so ago, I started to think it could be a good idea to try and get some sort of appreciation of future studies methods (scenario planning and the like) so I duly worked my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/scenario-planning-second-gill-ringland/dp/047001881x/?tag=" ouseful-21="">Scenario Planning</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Long-View-Planning-Uncertain/dp/0471977853/?tag=ouseful-21">The Art of the Long View</a> and a selection of papers about the <a href="http://www.izt.de/eurendel/scope_of_the_project/delphi_method.html">Delphi Method</a> and so on and.... then never really tried to put any of ithe methods into practise... hmmm.....</p>

<p>Anyway, I recently stumbled across an intriguing sounding paper "Applying Future Studies Methods to Understanding the Impact of University Information and Communication Technology Strategies on Learning" (actually co-authored by James Aczel, an academic here in the OU), scribbled it's DOI (doi:10.2304/elea.2007.4.4.398) on a scrap of paper, and finally got round to downloading it after building a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/014020.html">quick libezproxied DOI helper form</a> to do the lifting ;-)<br />
   <br />
The paper analyses the IT strategy teaching and learning support from three universities that are involved with various flavours of distance higher education - the African Virtual University (AVU), the Arab Open University (AOU) and the Syrian Virtual University (SVU) - and characterises the technologies available under various generations of distance learning:<br />
<blockquote>The first generation is print-based correspondence study. The second generation is that of multimedia, in which print was integrated with television and radio broadcasts, video and audio cassettes, and, later, desktop software. The third generation is that of 'telelearning', largely based on audio-conferencing and video-conferencing via telecommunications technologies. Descriptions of proposed subsequent generations ...  might now be collectively referred to under the label 'e-learning'. For example, ... the fourth generation [might be described] as the 'flexible learning model', largely using the Internet to deliver courseware and to support asynchronous written communication (and sometimes audio-conferencing and videoconferencing). ... [It] allows multimedia, multi-interactive, multimodal and multi-collaborative learning to take place in the vast majority of homes in such countries.</p>

<p>... [a] fifth generation is currently emerging (the 'intelligent flexible learning model'), in which institutional services are provided via the Internet, and in which systems use course materials and past interactions between students and tutors as the basis for firstpass automated responses. ...</p>

<p>A sixth generation, also emerging, is ubiquitous mobile access to multimedia learning (freeing distance education from the fixed physical locations of hardware), and the routine expectation that students engage in discussions with tutors and peers not only via asynchronous text but also via synchronous video.</blockquote>Here's the summary table of the above, taken directly from the paper:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2380657613/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2371/2380657613_6188ff5d21.jpg" alt="Aczel TAL ICT Futures" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="220" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The paper plots these various technologies on a variety of charts, (in particular, on charts with globalisation vs. individual-social dimensions, and globalisation vs. individual reflection dimensions) but what I wanted to flag here was the following diagram, which plots technologies against information-experience and (learner) autonomy axes, identifying four possible distance university scenarios as a result:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/2380659763/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2340/2380659763_8f2589b1e3.jpg" alt="Aczel ICT TAL Future scenarios" style="border: 0pt none ;" height="415" width="500" /></a></p>

<blockquote>The 'easyUniversity' scenario (with apologies to the founder of EasyJet, Stelios Haji-Ioannou) is based on increasing the effectiveness and convenience of the presentation of information. The aim is to enable students to purchase self-contained highquality training packages, without fuss or frills. The 'easyUniversity' is based on information and does not demand much student autonomy.

<p>The 'professional school' scenario, meanwhile, is more about the training that lawyers, doctors, business managers and teachers seek. The professional school differs from the easyUniversity in terms of the balance between experience and information. It is not simply enough to have information presented effectively and conveniently; there needs to be a practical element that allows the trainee to experience something of what it means to be a professional, and to develop a range of practical skills. The professional school is based on experience and constrains student autonomy to the reflections made on practical experience.</p>

<p>The 'Google university' differs from the easyUniversity in terms of student autonomy. The Google university envisions a world of rich materials, which students search for themselves. Far from being pre-packaged, these materials lend themselves to a variety of uses, and students locate and sequence these materials by means of automatic facilities that parse and interpret text, images, usage histories, ratings given by others and correlations with successful learning outcomes. The Google university is based on information and gives the student much autonomy.</p>

<p>Finally, the 'AI campus' scenario focuses on student learning from thoroughgoing intellectual engagement. Like the Google university, there is high student autonomy; but unlike the Google university, learning comes directly from the feedback provided by open-ended projects, experiments, simulations and gameworlds, rather than from documents or media clips. The AI campus shares with the professional school a concern to facilitate experience, but since the focus is not so clearly vocational, the AI campus emphasises student autonomy over mastery of predefined knowledge and skills. The AI campus is based on experience and gives the student some autonomy.</blockquote>I can't remember what the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/ou-futures/environment-prospects.shtm">OU Futures scenarios</a> that were produced a few years ago identified, but I think it'd be interesting to compare them to the above... [two reasons for looking at OU futures scenarios again, actually: 1) to see how the HE landscape scenarios identified a couple of years ago are playing out today; 2) to see how robust the above distance HE models are in the context of the OU futures scenarios...]</p>

<h3 class="title">2008 - The Web Goes Mobile...</h3>

<!--
<p>Google already is mobile of course - <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/12-google-services-with-mobile-access/">12 Google Services with Mobile Access</a> - but with the announcement of <a href="http://code.google.com/android/" android="" mobile="" phone="" o="" s="">Android</a> last year, as well as the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/071218-161155.php">Google partnership with Tom Tom</a>, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Google logo getting out and about a bit more this year, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUk3pICUcPk">this movie</a> suggests:</p>

<p><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SUk3pICUcPk&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SUk3pICUcPk&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></object></p>

<p>Providing a live data link - as well as a return path - to satnav devices, is something else that is likely to take off a little more this year, I suspect, as the satnav vendors try to keep prices high by adding extra functionality in the form of connectivity.</p>

<p>To date, I think that mobile phones  - with a bluetooth connection to the satnav device - have been used to provide the data link, though as wireless access becomes more and more widespread, I can see more use being made of it opportunistically; by which I mean, I can see service stations and petrol stations providing free wifi hotspots that will provide you with a quick batch load update when you stop for fuel or a quick coffee.</p>

<p>It'd be interesting to know if this could work quickly enough to give you a data top-up as you're driving under a service station connecting bridge on the motoway so you don't even have to stop:-)</p>

<p>In residential areas, there'd be the opportunity for drive-by downloads or data top-ups using services like <a href="https://www.beta.bt.com/apps/openwifi/">BT Fon</a>, which allows you to share other people's home wifi networks opportunistically (read more generally about <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">fon</a>).</p>

<p>In the meantime, a quick peak at the TomTom site suggests that you can now get a data receiver at least to plug in to your satnav device using their <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/page.php?Page=rds-tmc">RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver</a>.</p>

<p>TomTom are also making an early play for chat via satnav - their <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/plus/service.php?ID=11&amp;l=1">Buddies</a> service:<br />
<blockquote>The TomTom Buddies service allows you to communicate with and navigate to your buddies directly on your TomTom device:<br />
    * Invite your friends to become your TomTom Buddies.<br />
    * Send text messages and locations to each other.<br />
    * Show your buddies on the map.<br />
    * Navigate to your friends easily and quickly, wherever they are.</blockquote></p>

<p>TomTom is also taking of from the car radio too, it seems - "Feel like catching up with all the latest bestsellers the easy way? Can't find the time to catch up on your favourite books and business magazines? Want to use your travel time productively? Why not try <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/plus/service.php?ID=13&amp;l=1">TomTom Audiobooks</a>?"</p>

<p>(As audio delivery gets increasingly attractive day by day, I keep wondering why we don't try to do a couple of predominantly audio courses, and deliver them through iTunes and things like TomTom audiobooks...)</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be so interesting if it was only Google who was hooking up in this sector. But with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/nokia_buys_navt.html">Nokia buying mapping company Navteq</a> last year, as well as getting into widgets with <a href="http://www.widsets.com/info/aboutus.html">widsets</a> and the music download business with the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4634018">Nokia music store</a>, the whole area is getting interesting, particularly as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6gqipmbcok">devices become increasingly locatable even if they don't support GPS</a>:</p>

<p><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v6gqipmbcok&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v6gqipmbcok&amp;rel=1&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></object></p>

<p>PS I figure I'd quite like to get into the ideas consultancy business this year, so if please feel free to get in touch if you need someone to help spread a little craziness around!;-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/mobile" rel="tag">mobile</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gps" rel="tag">gps</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/satnav" rel="tag">satnav</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Surveillance 2.0?! - Logo Detection</h3>

<!--
<p>Three or four years ago, now, while I was still trying to find a way of using blogging tools that worked for me, I created a shortlived Blogger blog as a place to dump crazy techie ideas. One of those ideas was <a href="http://techietoys.blogspot.com/index.html#107556636857897683">Logo2icon</a>, which would turn logos that appeared in movies/tv programmes etc. into clickable icons (or would at least register the presence the brand logo and provide a navigation link through to an associated web page).</p>

<p>Here's what I read in the news today... <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7124735.stm">CCTV could track branded suspects</a></p>

<p>Brands on the clothes of suspects caught on CCTV cameras could be used to help police track them down.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police is looking into technology which can automatically identify branded logos on clothing.</p>

<p>Police believe that tracking suspects by their distinctive clothes will help cut down on the manual scanning of hundreds of hours of video footage.</p>

<p>The technology is already used to automatically identify company logos in TV broadcasts of sporting events.</blockquote><br />
With an increasing number of online TV catchup services, as well as internet TV services such as Joost providing players with various kinds of embedded and pop-up player controlas and additional services, it may be worth thinking again about how logo2icon services might work to surface links to web properties related to the content appearing on-screen?</p>

<p>Just for my own reference, here's some related readings:</p>

<p><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1290096">Trademark matching and retrieval in sports video databases</a> "describe[s] a system for detection and retrieval of trademarks appearing in sports videos"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.omniperception.com/products/magellan">OmniPerception Magellan</a> Automated Brand Analysis and Logo Detection software provides the tools necessary for the automatic identification, analysis and reporting of brand exposure and product placement in TV, film and other image communications media.</p>

<p>PS I still think <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010121.html">Re:Play - I'll take it from here</a> is a no-brainer...;-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/logo2icon" rel="tag">logo2icon</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Ever since I caught <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">William Gibson</a> reading aloud "there's no there, there" on a late night, BBC2 cultural review show, I've been enthralled by his prose. I finally succumbed to temptation last night and started reading his latest novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spook-Country-William-Gibson/dp/0670914940?tag=ouseful-21">Spook Country</a>, which I had been saving for the Christmas break.</p>

<p>Gibson is a redistributor of a future that is already here, in nascent form at least. He's also inventing the future by proxy, articulating visions of technology that his "geek readers" can go away and build. Space opera is too far away - Gibson's worlds are rooted in the labs and early adopter communities of today.</p>

<p>If the cyberspace of Gibson's earlier work is just too much like science fiction for you, even with the explosive growth in persistent, online 3D virtual worlds over the last couple of years, you can find glimpses of the future in filings to the world's patent offices.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/">SEO by the Sea</a> blog has become essential reading for me - every couple of days, a patent from one of the search companies is described in narrative form, or a commentary is made about patent trends.</p>

<p>One post that particularly caught my eye this week was <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=898">Google and Personalization in Rankings</a>. It describes a scenario in which:<br />
<blockquote>a search engine might expand your queries based upon other things that you may have searched for in the same session based upon a language model centered around the queries themselves.</p>

<p>That kind of model created for queries could also be created for searchers, who could be clustered together with other searchers who seem to choose similar results for certain queries...</blockquote><br />
I've been thinking a lot lately about how the behaviour across a "network of like minded peers" - who may or may not know each other - might be used to provide support and recommendations to a learner connected into a social platform that can identify such networks.</p>

<p>If I want to learn about a topic, I come to it with some base level of understanding which may be quite different from yours. In an OU context, you may have studied a recommended precursor course, for example, but I may not... The way I use course materials, and maybe search around them for additional supporting material, may be different to the way you approach the course, but may resemble the behaviour of other students. The language I use to construct queries on a topic may also be indicative of my level of understanding about the subject.</p>

<p>By clustering my behaviour with that of others at a similar level to me, several things become possible. Firstly, I can be paired with other people who are currently 'in the same boat'. Secondly, I can have materials recommended to me that are appropriate for my current level of understanding, based on the aggregate behaviour of people who have previously been 'at my level'.</p>

<p>My thinking is this - can behaviour of individuals across a widely spread social learning network be mined to fulfil the role of the 'more competent peer' that plays an important role in Vygotsky's description of the Zone of Proximal Development?</p>

<p>And can more competent peers be introduced to me through that network, who can help mentor me through a learning topic on the one hand, and provide a 'teach on' opportunity for them in return, which may help improve their understanding of the topic in question?</p>

<p>PS to what extent is <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/my-facebook-friends-do-my-work-for-me/">My Facebook Friends Do My Work For Me</a> an example of one sort of 'more competent peer' discovery process?</p>

<p>So my reorganised department has a new name - Communication (<em>sic</em>) and Systems - and we're in the <a href="http://wml.open.ac.uk/">Mathematics, Computing and Technology Faculty</a> (I really don't understand the URL? hopefully it's temporary?), along with the Computing Department, the spritely named Design, Development, Environmental and Materials Department (they wanted to be called "Human and Technological Futures", I think?), and the Mathematics and Statistics Department.</p>

<p>As befits a deptartment that includes the old ICT and Technology Management departments, and a Faculty that includes us and the Computing department, the (ongoing) integration of our previously distinct IT systems is <em>not</em> going smoothly. The old Technology Faculty and Maths and Computing Faculties, which have merged to create the new faculty, used separate email, mailing list and conferencing systems, and reconciling them is causing the IT strategy group severe problems, I think... heh heh :-)</p>

<p>Reorganisation has also provided the opportunity for lots of new groups to help us co-ordinate our various activities (?!). One such group is a 'scanning' group for the combined Masters programme. I'm not too sure what they are scanning, exactly, (though I'm trying to find out), but here are some of the things that I pay (partial;-) attention to that I would class as scanning activity...<br />
<ul><li><em>technology trends scanning</em> - (i.e. what should go in our courses 3-5 years down the line?  the UK gov <a href="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/horizonscanning/">Horizon Scanning Centre</a> occasional publishes some interesting stuff, and the <a href="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/HORIZON_SCANNING_CENTRE/FANclub/Index.html">Futures Analysts' Network (FAN Club)</a> regularly have get togethers (not that I've ever been able to get to one...); I personally sign up to alerts from some of the <a href="%20http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/consultants">IT consultancies</a> and occasionally try to interest others in what they do (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009231.html">Harnessing New  Technologies</a>);</li><br />
<li><em>competitor scanning</em> - why can't we do almost anytime start courses, like <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/lifelong_learning/distance_learning.htm">Liverpool</a>for example (I spotted that from an ad on Technorati!);</li><br />
<li>policy tracking - that is, IT and technology policy, rather than skills etc.; e.g. the <a href="http://www.pitcom.org.uk/">Parliamentary Information Technology Committee</a> and <a href="http://www.egovmonitor.com/">eGov Monitor</a> are on my feed subscription list;</li><br />
<li>job tracking - e..g <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/">IT Jobs Watch</a> is a fun way to spend a coffee break once a month;-)</li><br />
<li>student numbers - our strategy and planning office presumably produce briefings (?), IET publish lots of stats, (and the new <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">Facebook app stats</a> may also be worth casting an eye over every now and again? ;-);  <a href="http://www.ucas.com/about_us/stat_services/">UCAS</a> publish annual statistics about HE degree uptake - I keep wondering whether I'd get into trouble if I uploaded their data to Many Eyes?</li><br />
<li>watching the funders - <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/">HEFCE</a>, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>, and the <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> are the ones I keep a weather eye out for - though I rarely approach them. I should probably pay a little more attention to <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">BECTA</a> too...</li><br />
<li>And of course, you can't beat good old immersion in the blogosphere either ;-) When we were scoping Click On series 2, I set up an <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/subscribe.php?preconfig=5d6d79ac409c195e34780586f97233a8">ICT tech news'n'blogs watch page on Netvibes</a>, which provides an at a glance view over a quirky sampling of the IT news space! I have to admit I prefer the river of news view I get daily in my feedreader, though...</li></ul><br />
What really strikes me is that scanning is about being sensitive to the flow and dynamics of what's going on, picking up signals from the ongoing chatter, rather than infrequently sampling from the deluge...</p>

<p>Groups are all very well, but this sort of thing needs an ongoing conversation... it strikes me that subscribing to feeds is a good way of supporting this sort of activity... and as we all know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>.<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rss" rel="tag">rss</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/horizon%20scanning" rel="tag">horizon scanning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Although I haven't been keeping up with new stuff in photography for last the couple of weeks(?!) - the last lookaround I did was when I started assembling the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010527.html">Future of Photogrpahy</a> video compilation - it struck me that there was a whole raft of tools out there that I could see estate agents (realtors?) making use of in the coming years...</p>

<p>So here's a quick roundup...</p>

<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=l7lzDG6nTUE">3D animated room tours</a> from <a href="http://www.3dplanview.com/">3DPlanView</a>.<br />
 <br />
<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l7lzDG6nTUE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l7lzDG6nTUE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>For viewing the outside the property in 3d, all you need is a  photo - <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=nPt7GmIpXo8">Fotowoosh version Alpha</a> from <a href="http://fotowoosh.com">fotowoosh</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Another 2D to 3D mapping comes from <a href="http://www.metropix.co.uk/mtpix/index.aspx">Metropix</a>, which allows you to create 3D walkthroughs from 2D floor plans. I couldn't find an embeddable video demo, so you'll have to <a href="http://www.metropix.co.uk/mtpix/walkthroughs.aspx">try here</a>.</p>

<p>Getting measurements is always likely to be problematic - so how about using a photo to get your measurements: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ShhxxAEPRjU">iphotomeasure tutorial</a> from <a href="http://www.iphotomeasure.com/">iphotomeasure</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ShhxxAEPRjU"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ShhxxAEPRjU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Decorating the room can be done with somethign like the <a href="http://www.designmyroom.com/">Design My Room</a> <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/centernetworks/videos/58/">room decorating tool</a></p>

<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/58f4a318/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/58f4a318/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler" ></embed></object></p>

<p>On a similiar theme is <a href="http://www.scenecaster.com/">Scenecaster</a>, which allows you to reuse models form the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse">Google Sketchup 3D model warehouse</a>as <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Z8CYzLnULnY">this movie shows</a>.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Z8CYzLnULnY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Z8CYzLnULnY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>You'll need to check local information about a property of course - <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/">UpMyStreet</a> is a good place to satrt, as are <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/">Google mapplets</a> - check out the <a href="http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/2007/06/27/nestoria-uk-property-search-google-mapplet/">Nestoria mapplet</a> to get a feel for what's possible.</p>

<p>You'll probably also want to keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/apihowto.php">planning notices</a>, and then maybe consider online conveyancing, e.g. using things like <a href="http://www.landregisteronline.gov.uk/lro/index.html">Land Registry online</a>.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/estateagents" rel="tag">estateagents</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Save Game As Source...</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010121.html">Re:Play - The Future of Sports Gaming? "I'll Take it From Here..."</a>, I daydreamed about "sports simulations in which the state of the game at which the player starts is a duplicate of the state of the game in the real world". The idea there was that from the TV coverage of a game you could capture the state of a snooker table mid-frame, for example, or the lie of the ball from a couple of shots in to a par 5 golf hole, and then "play on" via your console. </p>

<p>Whilst we're not there yet, the launch of Halo 3 turns up this interesting snippet as it goes <a href="http://www.last100.com/2007/09/25/halo-3-is-out-how-microsofts-strategy-extends-beyond-gaming/">beyond gaming</a>:<br />
<blockquote>... Saved Films, allows players to save a copy of a game play to their console's hard drive so that it can be reviewed later on. Lots of games, especially in the sports genre, have a similar feature, but Halo 3 is the first console game to really implement it well. Interestingly, <strong>Saved Films are not video files but instead contain the actual game data</strong> [emphasis mine]. This enables users to replay the game at any resolution, and to change things like camera angles. Saved Films might seem like a minor feature at first, but I think it's really important for two reasons. Number one, it allows players to create clips and screenshots that can be shared with other players, effectively enabling mashups and remixes of Halo 3. Number two, it's the first step toward allowing players to script their own storylines and movies.</blockquote></p>

<p>The ability to save game play as <em>data</em> also resonates with the idea of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010108.html">releasing music as Garageband 'source' files</a>, for example...</p>

<p>The future is bright, the future is "Save As Data"! ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/games" rel="tag">games</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gaming" rel="tag">gaming</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>A few months ago, I posted some thoughts on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010508.html">The Future of Photography</a>, some elements of which I picked up on again just a few days ago in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010524.html">Embedding Google Maps and Adding Photos to Google Earth</a>.</p>

<p>As there are plenty of video demos around in this area, I put together a Splashcast show on the topic, and added to to my <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/channels/?c=GIPJ3220JF">OUseful Stories</a> channel.</p>

<p>The show is currently first up on the <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/channels/?c=GIPJ3220JF">OUseful Stories</a> channel. If the show isn't at the top of the channel, you'll be able to find it from the Channel Guide - the show's called "The Future  of Photography".</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/so/1//c/GIPJ3220JF" /s/WSOR8784UR" wmode="Transparent" width="400" height="300" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /><table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=GIPJ3220JF" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add OUseful Stories to your page</font></a></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The running time is, err, quite long, but the movies are many and varied, including shorts on photo-morphing, timelapsed movies, Photoshop fakery, Google Earth embedding, phototourism, and 3D model generation. The audio on the second movie is rather jarring, but most of the other soundtracks aren't too bad...</p>

<p>To skip a segment, hover over the bottom of the Splashcast widget and a popup toolbar will appear from which you can step on to the next movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5106132467041570210"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RtygbOIaDaI/AAAAAAAAAhk/e7LRXTOEGpA/s800/splashCastToolbar.png" /></a></p>

<p>The one problem I have with Splashcast is that I can't find a way of directly linking to a show, other than by creating a channel that contains only that show, and adding the channel to a player that only plays that channel.</p>

<p>If you know how to link directly to a show, and/or how to embed a player that starts playing an arbitrary channel, or arbitrary show other than the one at the top of a channel list assigned to a particular player, please let me know...</p>

<p>PS if your holiday snaps didn't turn out quite how you wanted them to, why not check out OUr <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography short course</a>?</p>

<p>Even before I read the related TechCrunch post today, I was thinking over breakfast about a possible blog post on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/05/microsoft-photosynth-covers-shuttle-endeavour-pre-launch/">3D worlds from photos</a> for the <a href="http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/">Open2.net <em>Science, technology &amp; Nature</em> blog</a>.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://fotowoosh.com/">Fotowoosh</a> (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPt7GmIpXo8">Fotowoosh on YouTube</a>) generate 3D models from a single image:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSynth</a> creates 3D browsing from a collage of separate pictures (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g1kCNjAscc">Photosynth on YouTube</a>) :</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3g1kCNjAscc"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3g1kCNjAscc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/visualsize-to-give-accurate-3d-measurements-from-photos/">VisualSize</a> falls somewhere in between, offering the ability to make accurate measurements from two photographs of the same scene...</p>

<p>VisualSize in particular made me wonder - how long will it be before we get "binocular" cameras? Something the size of a Sony PSP, for example, with a camera lens at either end and a built in 3D viewer?</p>

<p>I was going to say 2008 for the early gadget adopters, with the first hints of volume in 2009 amongst users who photograph objects (buildings, and trains(?!) for example, rather than people/faces and scenery), depending on how things like Fotowoosh play out, but thought I'd better do a v quick search first...</p>

<p>Hmmm - <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=7402&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=3470">Kodak dual lens digital camera</a>, with "On-camera panorama stitch mode" (see the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/digital-cameras/ces-unveiled-kodak-dual+lens-digital-v570-146343.php">Gizmodo review</a>).</p>

<p>Those dates could be about right then?!</p>
