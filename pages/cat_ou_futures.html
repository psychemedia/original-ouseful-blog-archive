<h3 class="title">Open Tentacles</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I got what feels like my weekly Amazon delivery (1-click goodness...!) and was surprised to see an OU logo (or sorts) staring back at me from the back cover of one of the books that fell out of the package.</p>

<p>The book in question - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Cultures-Computer-Games-Media/dp/033521357X/ref=sr_11_1/026-1676656-2894836?tag=ouseful-21">Game Cultures: Computer Games as New Media (Paperback)</a> - just happens to be published by the <a href="http://www.openup.co.uk">Open University Press</a>, which I hadn't realised at the time I purchased it (not that that would have made any difference...).</p>

<p>Just like other universities, we have a university press (via McGraw-Hill Education) that publishes books, err, according to what criteria I'm not quite sure? [see comment]</p>

<p><em>Unlike</em> many other institutions, we <em>also</em> enter into co-publication deals for books that will be supplied with some of our courses, a consequence in part of being a distance learning organisation that operates at large scale.</p>

<p>We also co-produce broadcast radio and television with the BBC. Most of the programmes are supported with a page or two on <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> (which is produced by BBC Worldwide under contract to the OU, I think) and DVDs of some of the programmes - such as <em>Rough Science</em> and presumably <em>Coast</em> - can be bought through <a href="http://www.ouw.co.uk/">Open University Worldwide (OUW)</a>.</p>

<p>OUW also sell course packs (but site navigation is lousy; and guys - check out the favicon...and if I were you, I'd make <em>http://ouw.co.uk</em> point somewhere sensible, too - you'll see why in a minute...)</p>

<p>Corporate Open University Services - <a href="http://www.corous.com">COROUS</a> - is the "company that works with you to develop the full potential of your workforce" by using "an appropriate blend of online and offline learning strategies to enable organisations to develop their human capital"; that is, it's the bit of the OU that provides "learning, tailored to needs, to many of the biggest names in international commerce and UK public services."</p>

<p>That site doesn't respect a dropped <em>www</em> in the url either (I'm thinking: <em>http://corous.com</em> - DON'T TRY IT) with rather more unfortunate consequences than the 404 that <em>http://ouw.co.uk</em> gives:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5091621316791444306"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RqkSnG4pI1I/AAAAAAAAALA/7O437UkKsuM/s800/corousHacked.png" /></a></p>

<p>[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.ouworldwide.com/">Open University Worldwide (OUWorldWide)</a> seems to be an internationalist education wing of the university, looking to promote our values, social justice mission and methods across the world.<br />
<blockquote>Open University Worldwide can put the Open University's wealth of materials, technology and expertise to work to support your interests, capabilities or productivity. We manage the OU's international teaching partnerships, corporate e-learning programmes and educational consulting services. We handle multimedia product sales, distribution and licensing. We foster academic fellowship and mutual exchange.</blockquote>]</p>

<p>The OU also has a raft of other URLs (<em>http://openuniversity.com</em>, <em>http://openlearn.com</em> and <em>http://openlearn.org</em> come to mind), but at the moment they seem to resolve/redirect to the <em>open.ac.uk</em> domain.</p>

<p>[UPDATE: There are also some services we offer that don't have their own domain, but which could do? <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/validate/index.shtml">Open University Validation Services</a>, for example: "The Open University offers a quality assurance and validation service for higher education organisations which do not have their own degree awarding powers."</p>

<p>Or how about <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/employers/">CPD Services for Employers</a>. Err, oops - the CPD site is here: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/cpd/">Continuing Professional Development</a>]</p>

<p><br />
PS just because, here are some <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=3SNk-iXVEfw"><em>Ozric</em> Tentacles</a>...</p>

<h3 class="title">"When T293 had its last presentation in 2001...": We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</h3>

<p>I'm down to do a 15 minute slot on Tuesday at a scoping meeting for a new second level course, where the discussion will be on possible subject matter for each of the course blocks. One of the possible major themes for the course harkens back to a previous course - <em>T293 Communicating Technology</em> - which mixed the development of communication skills (presentations, teamworking, reading skills, and so on) with teaching about the technical side of telecommunication systems.</p>

<p>One of the areas I think we should be considering is data visualisation and interpretation. Thinking about how to make that argument, I got a sidetracked (!? - no surprise there, then ;-) with a more general view, relating to how we might start develop the use of digital media use and skills development in our courses.</p>

<p>The format of this piece is - as regular readers will have noticed - heavily influenced by <a href="./010271.html">We ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>. It contains several embedded movies. If you are reading this through a feed reader, it's quite likely the movies won't appear - click through to see them. They help make sense of the story I want to tell...</p>

<p>[UPDATE: if you would rather watch a version of the following part of the post as a movie, rather than read through it/watch the embedded movies, tune in to the <a href="./010459.html"><em>We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</em> Splashcast show</a>.]</p>

<p><hr /><br />
<h2>We Ignore Digital Media at OUr Peril</h2></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, let alone when it started, the democratisation of affordable and wide reaching technologies capable of producing and distributing rich media had hardly begun. At the T293 course residential school, an OHP was the way we presented our slides to students, and the way students made presentations to each other. Data projectors were still cumbersome and expensive and Powerpoint presentations, let alone the use of interactive whiteboards, had not made it into the course. Both of these technologies are now a mainstay of Primary School ICT education here in the UK.</p>

<p>Powerpoint <em>per se</em> will not, of course, guarantee a successful presentation...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>.... although in the right hands, it can be a highly effective visual aid <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/clear_visuals_w.html">reinforce the presenter's message</a>.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RrpajcAgR1E"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RrpajcAgR1E" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>(If you want to know just <em>how</em> to do that sort of presentation, here's a clue: <a href="ttp://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20040712/techspace01.shtml">Powerpoint <em>presenter view</em> and dual monitor displays</a>. For more on why you should only use <em>small</em> amounts of text on a presentation slide, check out <a href="./010298.html">Powerpoint Presentations That Support Glanceability</a>.)</p>

<p>To get an idea of just how wide ranging presentation styles can be, check out  <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>.</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=42907&doc=meet-charlie-what-is-enterprise20-29751" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=42907&doc=meet-charlie-what-is-enterprise20-29751" /></object></p>

<p>Whether slides are any use <a href="http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/06/powerpoint-and-.html"><em>after the fact</em></a> is another matter...</p>

<p><em>We ignore digital presentation tools at our peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there were no social networks that had the popular reach of <a href="http://myspace.com">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://bebo.com">Bebo</a>, or <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. (If you have young kids  - ask them about <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/">Club Penguin</a>.) Want "proof"? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=facebook%2C+myspace%2C+%22club+penguin%22%2C+bebo%2C+%22open+university%22&ctab=0&geo=GB&date=all&sort=0">You got it</a>. ["Proof by Google" &trade; ;-)]</p>

<p>There are  - at the time of posting - one thousand five hundred and eighty members of "The Open University" group on Facebook.</p>

<p>If you <em>haven't</em> been listening, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook is making a play as a platform</a>, trying to create a social network ecosystem in the way that the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> platforms have built ecosystems around retail and auctions (and like UPS has built a <a href="http://www.ups-scs.com/">supply chain platform</a>, come to that...).</p>

<p>If you don't know what a platform is, <a href="http://blog.sethgoldstein.com/2007/06/11/facebook-foam/">WAKE UP</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore social networks and social technology platforms at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there were no large scale, easy to use sites for uploading and sharing personally generated media. No real <em>photo sharing</em> in the <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>-style, no <em>movie sharing</em> sites like <a href="http://youtube.com">youTube</a>. Want "proof'? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22photo+sharing%22%2C+%22video+sharing%22&ctab=0&geo=all&geor=all&date=all&sort=0">You got it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/online+photo+editor">Photo editing</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/online+photo+editor">video editing</a> tools were barely available <em>offline</em>, let alone <em>online</em>, and the thought of being able to remix "the source audio" of a commercial album using your own computer's preloaded mixing desk - think <a href="./010108.html">Nine Inch Nails' Garageband release</a> - was virtually unimaginable.</p>

<p>Now it's possible to "do" digital storytelling using the tools you can find via your browser.</p>

<p>Err - digital storytelling??? Things like this, maybe:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLlGopyXT_g"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLlGopyXT_g" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Okay - so that's slick - but you can always use something like <a href="http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/2007/05/23/learning_programming_from_scratch">Scratch</a>, which does interactive games as well as simple multimedia animations.</p>

<p><em>We ignore "digital storytelling" at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, satellite television - and a few struggling cable TV companies - were the only alternative to the four (then five) free-to-air broadcast television channels in the UK. Digital radio was still in it's early days (and if truth be told, I suspect is still far from mainstream and further from exploiting its full potential).</p>

<p>Last week, I got an invite to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/">BBC Archive Trial</a>, which offers a glimpse into the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax">BBC back catalogue</a>; I already dabble with <a href="http://channel2.com/4od">Channel 4 On Demand</a>. <a href="http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=7785">ITV</a> have just started rolling out <em>their</em> online watch again service too, and <a href="http://www.btvision.bt.com/vision/index.htm">BT</a> are now getting into on-demand film delivery.</p>

<p>Then there are the pure internet plays too, of course: <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> and <a href="http://babelgum.com">Babelgum</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Want "proof"? <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=tv+on+demand%2C+broadband+tv%2C+watch+again%2C+listen+again&ctab=0&geo=all&geor=all&date=all&sort=0"><em>Proof by Google</em> &trade;</a>.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the changing nature of video distribution and consumption at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Didi I mention audio?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/progs/listenagain.shtml">BBC Listen Again</a> service provides access to a wide selection of radio content for seven days after it is broadcast, making home-taping unnecessary for 'listen once' activity <em>if</em> you can get to a browser within a week of a programme being broadcast. Many radio programmes and TV news clips also seem to be made <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=av&scope=all">available in perpetuity</a>. You can even edit some radio programmes and deep link into them using the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/findlistenlabel/help.html">Find, Listen, Label</a> tool.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://itunes.com">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, amongst others, demonstrate how offline and online audio consumption and distribution can be grown - and supported - purely via the internet. When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, there was nothing around like either of these services.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the changing nature of audio distribution and consumption at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>When T293 <s>finished presenting three or four years ago</s> had it's last presentation in 2001, computer gaming was HUGE, commercially. It still is.</p>

<p>As the mainstream engages in games that aren't - from <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> through <a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/">"flow"</a> to <a href="http://www.socialimpactgames.com/">serious games</a> - the <em>culture</em> surrounding gaming continues to grow, and the storyforms and methods of gameplay employed in games become entrenched in everyday pop culture.</p>

<p>"We" may "get" short stories, novels, two and three act plays, opera and ballet, maybe even abstract expressionism. But can you identify a game genre and the expected mode of gameplay at 50 paces in front of a hi-def, 40 inch plasma screen? Would you even begin to know what's expected of you as a player?</p>

<p>Oops - I forgot - games are interactive, and we do education... We just pour that knowledge into those empty vessel brains, don't we?</p>

<p><em>We <strong>continue</strong</em> to ignore computer gaming and interactive entertainment at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The world is increasingly awash with data. There is <em>no way</em> we can "explain it" all to our students. Instead, we need to find ways of helping OUr students explore data, mine it themselves, have <em>conversations</em> with it directly, and with each other about it.</p>

<p>The OU was one of the pioneers at an institutional level of the idea of the <em>tutorial in print</em>, engaging students through print material as if in they were in conversation with a tutor sat next to them.</p>

<p>In order to help OUr students make sense of data, we need to help them use the tools that allow them to ask questions of that data, and obtain appropriately visualised results in return.</p>

<p><a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">Gapminder</a> is one such beautiful (online) tool for visualising population and economic data.</p>

<p>Because I know most of you <em>won't</em> follow that link, here's an exquisite presentation showing Gapminder in action. The Gapminder demo starts 2.45 minutes in. I could deep-link to that point, but then you'll miss the first couple of minutes which set the scene about WHY this sort of display technology is so important...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RUwS1uAdUcI"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RUwS1uAdUcI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p><em>Social discussion</em> around data is important too, particular in an educational context. IBM's <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">Many Eyes</a> shows one possible way forward here. It not only provides a place to share data, it always provides a wealth of visualisation tools and social tools to rate and discuss visualisations.</p>

<p><em>We ignore the importance of developing data visualisation skills at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>The web is a visual place (although it is also becoming an increasingly important channel for the delivery audio files). In academia, we tend to emphasise textual representations.</p>

<p>Assessment is dominated by textual submissions from our students, partly because we do not tend to develop visual presentation skills.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">Periodic Table of Visualization Methods</a> demonstrates a wide variety of graphical techniques for communicating information.</p>

<p>It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. How brave would a course team have to be to introduce a final assessment that required the submission of two infographics or a two minute digital story, rather than a couple of thousand words in reply to short and long question answers?</p>

<p><em>We ignore the development of visual communication skills at OUr peril.</em></p>

<p>Space is important too - we live in a 3D world and are familiar with how 3D works. Spatial relationships affect how we live out our daily lives. Geography is important. And geography is coming to the data web.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of RSS feeds (which you <a href="./010271.html">ignore at your peril</a>), you probably won't have heard of geoRSS. (If you want to know what it is, Google or Wikipedia will tell you about it... That's where most of the rest of the world learn about the stuff they need - err, think they <em>want</em>? -  to know about...)</p>

<p>Here's a map that's powered by GeoRSS: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.online-archaeology.co.uk%2FGoogleMap%2FData%2FGenerateGeoRSS.aspx%3FCategoryID%3D64&ie=UTF8&z=4&om=1">English Civil War battles</a>. Using a service like the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/rss-to-georss-converter.html">GeoNames RSS to GeoRSS converter</a>, I can create <em>another</em> sort of file - a KML file - that will display the battlefield locations in <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a>.</p>

<p>You can also add 3D models to Google Earth using <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup</a>, of course, though at the moment, you have to pay to <a href="http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/ug_movies.html">record movies made inside Google Earth</a> if you don't want to use screen recorder software.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lkTMMJZI65M"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lkTMMJZI65M" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>If you liked that, then you'll love <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSynth</a>, which stitches photos together to give photorealistic (indeed, photo generated) 3D models.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="./007032.html">Fotowoosh</a> will create a 3D model from a <em>single</em> photo. Remember Bladerunner?  Here's a walk inside a photo for real:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>The 3D web is coming, and it's not just Second Life...</p>

<p><em>We ignore the 3D web at our peril.</em></p>

<p>Undeniably, rich digital media surrounds us - as do the tools of its production.</p>

<p><em>"The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed."</em><br />
<em>OUr mission - should we choose to accept it - is to redistribute that future.</em><br />
<strong><em>We ignore digital media at OUr peril.</em></strong></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay - so that's turned out to be a bit more than 15 minutes worth of stuff - but it was fun to compile...</p>

<p>Now I just to use the above as resources for a bit of digital storytelling...</p>

<h3 class="title">Disposable Apps</h3>

<p>Watching a Google Tech Talk <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/pipes-a-tech-talk">presentation by the Yahoo team responsible for Pipes</a> (?!;-), which made it clear that Pipes was intended to be used by the 10% of the Web 2.0 <a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=5">creator pyramid</a>, I was struck by the phrase <em>disposable application(s)</em> used to describe apps that are built to be used only once or twice.</p>

<p>(The tiniest bit of digging also turned up a post commenting on the <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/16/disposable-software/">disposable nature of presentations</a>.)</p>

<p>My department - the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk">Dept of ICT</a> - is currently in the middle of Faculty reorganisation that sees us joining with a couple of other departments (<a href="http://systems.open.ac.uk/">Systems</a> and <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tm/">Technology Management</a>, but <em>not</em> <a href="http://www.computing.open.ac.uk/">Computing</a> (don't you just love their URL?) - which <em>is</em> coming into the new Faculty (name tba), but is to be colocated in another part of the campus along with <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a>).</p>

<p>As a consequence of the reorganisation, we have a chance to reinvent ourselves yet again (over the last 10-15 years, the dept. has gone from being an electronics dept, to the Dept of Telematics, to the current Dept of ICT. (Computing always and, I suspect, ever shall be 'Computing', though their offerings <em>have</em> changed over time (e.g. they do less computer science than they used to, I think?).)</p>

<p>The department's reinventions have been pretty successful over time, and our courses remain attractive to employers as well as students. A move into work-based learning (e.g. through <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01G04">Foundation Degrees</a>), certified training with academic credit (e.g. with <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T228">Cisco</a>) and <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">web applications development</a>, backed up by courses addressing hard technology as well as 'softer' social issues, demonstrates a commitment to ongoing innovation in our curriculum.</p>

<p>The question is - where do we see the next 5-10 years going?</p>

<p>Turning back to the idea of 'disposable apps', one area we might consider is developing the idea of ICT <em>users</em> as <em>creators</em> - not only of content, but also of functionality.</p>

<p>As content becomes ubiquitous, the perceived barriers to entry to creating content are lowered.</p>

<p>The explosion of content on the web has many roots of course - content providers making back catalogues available online, broadcasters and the media making a land grab for eyeballs, and so on. As well as Jo Public publishing too, of course, facilitated by one-click web publishing systems (blogs) and online graffiti boards (comments and reviews, etc.;-)</p>

<p>But now we are starting to see one-click application development, too. As well as <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> (designed just for the top 10% remember), I also came across the <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/">Zoho Creator</a> today, one of many database application creators that have appeared over the last few months (<a href="http://dabbledb.com/">dabble db</a> is another one worth trying out).</p>

<p>Content is everywhere, and increasing numbers of people are adding to it as they are tempted to "just give personal web publishing a go".</p>

<p>Data is everywhere too. And it's getting easier and easier to collect. And harder and harder to manage...</p>

<p>...unless we start manipulating it as and when necessary.</p>

<p>Most of us cope with content glut by asking Google to do our hard work for us and find relevant results to our simple search queries.</p>

<p>But how do we cope with data glut? (We don't - we ignore the data...)</p>

<p>I think one thing to aim for is a time when writing data queries is as easy as Googling (did you pick up that Google acquired the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder Trendalyzer</a>?)</p>

<p>And another is finding one-click ways of plugging appropriate data visualisation tools (think <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">IBM's Many Eyes</a>,  and <a href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">then some</a>) into appropriate data sets that have been obtained via search box queries.</p>

<p>Data literacy? I think we should want some of that...</p>

<p>And disposable apps? We're <em>all</em> going to need to be our own developer...</p>

<h3 class="title">Tool of the Futurists' Trade: Population Forecasts</h3>

<p>I've recently started to take an interest in the various tools used by futurists and foresight analysts to help them scope out possible futures.</p>

<p>As with all new learning exercises, getting to grips with the vocabulary is the first hurdle, so I'm starting out by disambiguating in my own mind some of the "obvious things, such as <a href="http://www.b2binternational.com/whitepapers15.html">forecasting and scenario planning</a> (also see <a href="http://www.netmba.com/strategy/scenario/">here</a>).</p>

<p>I've also been trying to locating some of the more 'robust' statistical forecasting tools - like population forecasts and visualisations  of economic trends.</p>

<p>As far as UK population data goes (both historical and forecast data) there's a <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/populationestimates/svg_pyramid/ew/index.html">nice animation showing male/female population data broken down into age-based bins over the period 1961 to 2074</a> from the <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">UK National Statistics website</a>.</p>

<p>Static <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/uk.asp">population pyramids from the 2001 UK census</a> are also available from the same site:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/images/UK.gif" alt="example population pyramid from the 2001 UK census" /></p>

<p><br />
As far as visualising economic data goes, my base reference tool will probably be the <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder">Gapminder</a>/UN economic data visualisation tool demoed so beautifully by <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2670820702819322251#3m24s">Hans Rosling at TED Talks</a> in 2006.</p>

<h3 class="title">Personal Computing Guidance for Distance Education Students</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/26/678149.aspx">IE7 Blog</a> has just reported that:</p>

<blockquote>To help our customers become more secure and up-to-date, we will distribute IE7 as a high-priority update via Automatic Updates (AU) shortly after the final version is released for Windows XP, planned for the fourth quarter of this year.
...
If you decide to install IE7, it will preserve your current toolbars, home page, search settings, and favorites and installing will not change your choice of default browser. You will also be able to roll back to IE6 at any point by using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. Finally, users who have AU turned off will not be notified.</blockquote>

<p>This is something I think we in the OU should be taking into account <em>now</em> for courses starting in February, 2007 (<em>2007B</em>).</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx">Microsoft no longer supporting Windows 98</a> amidst stark warning notices ("Microsoft is retiring support for these products because they are outdated and can expose customers to security risks.") I think there is a case for the OU pushing our students to upgrade.</p>

<p>Why? Well, security for one, but with an O/S that supports a large installed base of IE7 (or <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, or maybe even something like <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> or <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>) this means that we can at the very least start to:</p>

<p>1) develop pedagogic strategies that exploit tabbed browsing (I haven't met one person who has been able to go back to a no tab browser having experienced tabbed browsing!); I think there are all sorts of ways we can develop user skills to exploit this functionality.</p>

<p>2) exploit in-built feed subscription. Okay, so I'm a feed junky, but whereas I can imagine a web future where all the pages are Atom or RSS and none end in <em>.html</em>, I can't imagine the converse... (note to self - revist <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/09/separating-navigation-from-content-and.html">The Skeletal Web: separating content, style and navigation</a> someday).</p>

<p>At the moment, OU courses require students' computers to conform to either a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/courses/Basic2007.shtm">basic specification</a> (Windows 98 SE) or a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/courses/Standard2007.shtm"> standard specification</a> (XP Home).</p>

<p>But maybe it's time to start rethinking even further..?</p>

<p>One the one hand, and one step on from the current wave of <a href="http://dip.lodoc.us/articles/2006/03/18/web-desktop-the-next-big-internet-tool">web start pages</a> like <a href="http://www.itchyhands.com/2005/12/23/overview-personalised-homepages">these</a>, the rise of the web desktops, or <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/03/01/8370596/index.htm">webtops</a> as they seem to be coming called in some quarters, means that maybe we could start to push forward an 'always on' computing specification for students who do have guaranteed, always on web access?</p>

<p>Historical note: it seems we've been here before, as this PC World article (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,32022,00.asp">"Ditch That Desktop for a Webtop</a>) from October 2000 demonstrates:<br />
<blockquote>With today's dispersed workforce and the ever-changing computer industry, organizations are consistently in a state of flux trying to keep end users up to date. The cost associated with investing in and maintaining office applications is high.<br />
To ease this burden, there is a new model of computing available today in its infancy: Webtops. These virtual desktops provide access to application suites via a Web browser. In the not-too-distant future, users won't be required to carry laptop computers to access, share, and manipulate information: They'll simply need Web appliances.<br />
...<br />
Research company Gartner Group predicts Webtops will become mainstream by 2002, and users will be free from relying on laptops to access the applications and information they need.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay - so maybe that was an ambitious prediction <em>then</em> and maybe things are different <em>now</em>? For example, many of the components for a web based collaborative office suite are in place (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=123">Web Office Suite: best of breed products</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, and <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0,,1816072,00.html">virtualisation</a> is only going to get easier (it's laready becoming <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/07/19/30OPcurve_1.html">free</a>).</p>

<p>Take for example this appealing approach that VMWare describe as <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/">virtual appliances</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A virtual appliance is a fully pre-installed and pre-configured application and operating system environment that runs on any standard x86 desktop or server in a self-contained, isolated environment known as a virtual machine. Virtual appliances provide an evolutionary step in the software distribution model.</blockquote>

<p>The main idea of virtualisation is that whatever your operating system, you can run <em>other</em> operating systems 'within' it. And the idea of virtual appliances is that that these other operating systems can actually be delivered to provide a guaranteed configuration (which means installing software within it can be managed efficiently, as in an enterprise setup.</p>

<p>Hmm -  methinks it could be interesting if we had an OU virtual appliance?</p>

<p>I'm convinced a third part of the mix will portable apps too, as discussed with respect to a mooted <a href="./005515.html">USB Study Stick</a>.  Quite how this would sit with a virtual appliance (unless  perhaps that virtual appliance lived on the memory stick?) I'm not sure yet. Maybe I need to start playing with some live cd distros, like <a href="http://knoppix.com">Knoppix</a> (I wonder if anyone has integrated this with an online storage client yet, <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/05/product_idea_li.html">as suggested for Amazon S3</a>?).</p>

<p>In he same way I think portable apps could be a huge boon for OUr students, I'm also starting to get a similar gut feeling towards <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/04/now-in-browser-near-you-offline-access.html">browser persistent storage</a> (or <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/firefox-2-client-side-storage-and-a-lot-more">natively</a>) - there's nothing I can articulate as yet, but it just feels right (and it's portable).</p>

<p>So interesting times... and for an organisation with 3 year lead in times to courses that have to last 8 years in presentation (unless the model changes...) I think it's time we started imagining 3, 5 and 10 year futures a little more seriously...</p>

<h3 class="title">A Common Academic Authentication System?</h3>

<p>I just noticed that Google have opened up an <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html">Account Authentication Proxy for Web-Based Applications</a>. This:</p>

<blockquote>... allows the application to access a Google service protected by a user's Google account. To maintain a high level of security, the Authentication Proxy interface, AuthSub, enables the application to get an authentication token without ever handling the user's account login information. Using the proxy, the user of the web application logs into their account through a Google-supplied login page and consents to grant limited access to the web application.</blockquote>

<p>An <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForInstalledApps.html">authentication service for installed Google apps</a> is also available under the wide <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/Authentication.html">Google Account Authentication</a> programme.</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/06/google_auth_launches.html">O'Reilly Radar</a> post on this announcement points out:</p>

<blockquote>This service lets you build a web app that uses Google's user accounts for user authentication. All the build-to-flip optimists will immediately adopt it, but the rest of us probably aren't willing to cede our users to Google just yet. The word I had from inside Google is that this is not an identity play, it's something they were developing for internal use and are offering externally to help people build add-ons to Google services (e.g., the documentation talks about a website with calendar data letting the users of the website add the dates to their Google Calendar).</blockquote>

<p>[<strong:Update:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/">John Dale</a> provides a useful (and concise) summary <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/google_account_authentication/">here</a>]</p>

<p>A couple of possibly OUseful things strike me about this:</p>

<p>1) would it be handy building a Google authentication into Moodle, so that Google services can be brought into that environment in PLE fashion (by which I mean that the users get to customise the <em>VLE</em> (whether OU, or <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk/">OCI</a>) by bringing in their own feeds and services etc. That is, using the VLE as a presentational shell for external services the student chooses to use?</p>

<p>2) The VC's bash asking whether the time is ripe to start moving <a href="./006923.html">Towards a Global Online University</a> threw up a few comments about what would be involved in a global play, as did <a href="./007019.html">Downe's talk on PLEs</a> the same day. (I need to start anchor naming sections of long posts, don't I, so I can link straight to the relevant section?) One thing I wonder is whether the provision of an academic web services framework (like the eBay or Amazon  e-commerce frameworks) may be one way to go? If so, providing a single sign on for users to access learning related services may be useful? Could users have a single sign on, for example, that would work across Moodle and elgg installations that were aligned with the single academic sign on service?</p>

<p>[<strong>Update 2:</strong> Stephen Downes picks up on some of the identity schemes that are gaining traction in a grass roots way in his personal <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/06/identity-networks-are-here.html">half hour post</a> today (err, yesterday?).]</p>

<h3 class="title">VC's Forum - Towards a Global Online University (raw)</h3>

<p>The following are my raw notes form the VC's Global Online University forum held earlier this week.</p>

<p>I haven't had time, and probably won't have time <a href="http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/">;-)</a> to go through these for a week or two to try and make sense of them, so here they are, in all their glory.</p>

<p>For OU staff, I think the talks are replayable in the <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">Berrill Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>-----------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Heppell</strong></p>

<p><br />
1996 - building big things<br />
2006 - Build things to help people to help each other</p>

<p>Lots of online essay-to-order websites, degrees for purchase, etc.</p>

<p>OU is about people:<br />
Originally - if you hate your job we'll help you get out of it. <br />
Now, if you love your job, we'll help you progress in it.</p>

<p>Communities of practise</p>

<p>21st century quality assurance</p>

<p>Global Online University is already here:<br />
high quality discourse, communities of (learning) practice, topic centred, project focussed  - gave example of online communities set up to discuss stratgey and tactics in run up to Round the Isalnd boat race.</p>

<p>a) do we want to be part of it?<br />
b) what are we contributing?<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Downes</strong></p>

<p>Should there be a global online university?</p>

<p>SD's visit here sandwiched between blog.ac.uk (personal publishing) and CETIS PLE event (PLEs created and owned by student, rather than a a particular institution).</p>

<p>Global - probably not.</p>

<p>Move towards distributed, decentralised network in which indivual are nodes and commincation links them together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain manifesto</a> - markets are changing from client-server model to a conversation. Consumers are involved in production of product.</p>

<p>Fishing rod tutor - buy a new fishing rod, try it out, the fishing rod says "you haven't fished before" and proceeds to instruct you. Learning travels with the environment or the artefact. Learning resources are part of background environment.</p>

<p>Web users starting to produce their own content/resource. With syndication(?), it starts to become an online educational resource.</p>

<p>Spontaneous online communities - common interest, background knowldge and expertise, ability and inclination to communicate - e.g. beekeeper group on Yahoo! groups.</p>

<p>This is the way of the future.</p>

<p>(Metauniversity/Charles Vest)</p>

<p>Four factors for network success:<br />
- diversity;<br />
- openness;<br />
- connectedness;<br />
- interaction/community.<br />
----------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - George Auckland, BBC</strong></p>

<p>Learn to let go - but really connect.</p>

<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/YoungGirl-OldWomanIllusion.html">Old lady/young woman illusion</a>:</p>

<p>BBC Education originally - old woman - started 1920s.</p>

<p>By 1928, realised learning needed to go beyond just broadcast.</p>

<p>Audiences are now changing: 1 in 3 don't think BBC makes programmes for them, 1 in 4 16-24 don't watch BBC. BUT GCSE Bitesize has 800, 000 userrs at this (revision) time of year.</p>

<p>Explosion of mdeia choice; move to on-demand viewing.</p>

<p>Need to realise full potential of any piece of content, exploit long tail: almost opposite of traditional broadcast model (large audience at time of broadcast).</p>

<p>360 degree exploitation:<br />
big wraparound of national broadcast - local broadcast, web sites, packs etc.</p>

<p>Big Ambition - all content available forever to be re-discovered, linked, clipped, built into other ideas.</p>

<p>How do you develop the brand with open source/content licensing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/create/">BBC Create</a><br />
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/archive/">BBC Open Schools Archive</a></p>

<p>IP is based on 'good ideas are hard to find' (Joe Kraus)  - is this still true? Has current IPR model had its day?</p>

<p>BBC has biggest/finest boradcast archibe in the world - the OU must have the HE equivalent.</p>

<p>Learn to let go of the content, but connect with the audience.</p>

<p>------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Yahoo! Research (pre-recorded video presentation)</strong></p>

<p>Important issues of web today are social networks, trust, reputation.</p>

<p>Social netowrking just one example of how net is self-organising to cope with growth of web.</p>

<p>Dealing with change is maybe main challenge of Yahoo today.</p>

<p>We don't know how the web will evolve, nor ways of accessing it.</p>

<p>TV had potential to become a force in education, but it has arguably, largely drifted away from that. Hopefully, the web will not evolve in the same way.</p>

<p>Content should not only be open, it should also be discoverable.</p>

<p>Difference between 'free' and 'open'.</p>

<p>To date, advertising has been dominant commercial model. ROI on advertising is measureable by measuring click-thru and consequrent purchase (opens up potential for affiliate based business models (e.g. Amazon Associates) as well as advertising).</p>

<p>--------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Malcolm Ross, Merlin Consulting</strong></p>

<p>Mobile/telecoms consultancy.</p>

<p>Telecoms scenarios for 2020 and potential impact on the way the OU operates as a business.</p>

<p>Telecoms tech: ICT is delivery enabler for HE. Effectively no performance limits on what is achievable.</p>

<p>Moore's law, Kryder's law (hard disk capacity), Gilder's law (bandwidth).</p>

<p>Morita - if you set a low enough size and cost point for a product someone will manage it.</p>

<p>Most thought should focus on areas where uncertainty is highest and impact on the current business model is biggest.</p>

<p>2D map - impact on one acces, uncertainty on another. Scenario planning has high imapct, high uncertainty focus.</p>

<p>Four basic scenarios based on supply and demand developments (2 axes again):</p>

<p>Supply - few gloabl players to many/everyone can do it.<br />
Demand - simple, generic, free to custom</p>

<p>Shouldn't try to predict an accepted future, rather come up with strategies that are robust for any mix of likely futures.</p>

<p>Robust strategies for 2020:<br />
- monetise staff, student and alumni; (linking people together for added value);<br />
- who's the teacher, who's the educator; leverage OU community as virtual consulting business;</p>

<p>?evolvability - imagine, create content, that may be sold but openly licensed. Other prope change the cotnent over time but its origin as my IPR is retained within metadata. In time, none of my original words are there, but I am still in metadata and still get some revenue when the content is sold. -> get returns for creating evolvable content.</p>

<p>=-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Werner Vogels, Amazon</strong></p>

<p>Digital Revolution:<br />
- the world is changing from hard to find knowledge/expert, to plentiful, reasliy available;<br />
- the changes are fundamental - personal expression, daily living, work and play, affecting culture, artistic expression, societal norms.</p>

<p>First phase of industrial revolution was mass production of steel. This was the enabler.<br />
In info revolution, still in phase 1.</p>

<p>Paradigm shift - <br />
business moving from monolith to ecosystem, move to platform, support customisatiomn (let users customise your business as they experience it); move from broadcast to viral, brochure to conversation; business moves from hierarchy to flat becuase information is becoming available to all.<br />
Amazon revolves around customer reviews.<br />
Customers have perfect information - if you aren;t to be trusted, customers will find out.<br />
Customers becoming sellers as well as buyers.<br />
Consumers moving from consumers to producers.</p>

<p><a href="http://istockphoto.com/index.php">iStockphoto</a> - killing traditional stock photo services.</p>

<p>We are still at day one. However:<br />
 - the internet is increasingly imprtant;<br />
 - for kids, thinjgs like Amazon have always been there. Information has always been completely available for them.</p>

<p>The kids will drive the second phase.</p>

<p>Info management skills will become ESSENTIAL.<br />
Understanding how things like reputation  (top hit on Google etc) are constructed.</p>

<p>---------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Michael Stevenson, DfES</strong></p>

<p>How might government see HE context wrt global online university.</p>

<p>Increased participation.</p>

<p>HE is a big business - so don't destabilise it. UK HE sector quite conservative.</p>

<p>90% of HEI are reliant on govt for at least 1/3 of funding. Resisting adoption of new technology - odd dabblings, but nothing revolutionary.<br />
BUT student body coming into HE with significant prior experience of online community and practice.</p>

<p>How do we unleash student demand further?<br />
How do we address financing?<br />
How do we get HEIs to collaborate?<br />
Greater role for private sector?<br />
How to engage employers?<br />
How to drive international expansion while protecting UK HE brand.</p>

<p>African educational development.<br />
Sustainable development.</p>

<p>Global online university would have to be built out of global partnerships - HE, IT companies (GYM etc.), content producers (e.g. BBC), cultural sectors.</p>

<p>Need for a business model (but impractical in developing world).</p>

<p>Should start with the greatest ambition but modest first steps.</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Riita Vanska, Nokia</strong></p>

<p>Use of mobile techniology in developing world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4126776">Bridge<em>it</em></a> - teachers order content via SMS, which is delivered overnight via satellite.<br />
<a href="http://mobiled.uiah.fi/?page_id=2">MobilED</a> - just utilising audio; audio connection to Wikipedia.<br />
(<a href="http://press.nokia.com/PR/200511/1021392_5.html">Village phone</a> - knowledge sharing)</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Svava Bjarnason, Observatory on Borderless Higher Education</strong></p>

<p>Why bother we a Global Online U?<br />
 - the context;<br />
 - the reality;<br />
 - the questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/">OBHE</a> - An International Strategic Info Service.<br />
- descriptive info;<br />
- strategic info.</p>

<p>Why GOU? - is it part of open content movement?<br />
 - capacity building in other countries?<br />
 - increasing student market?<br />
- building new research partnerships?</p>

<p>Online/tech is NOT ubiquitous. Connectivity is not available to all outside North America and Europe. In global context, English is not necessarily the dominant language.</p>

<p>Golbal HE - investment required, distribution of risk when working in partnership, balance of opportunity vs. strategy and/or tradition vs. innovation; need to be in long game for tangible results.</p>

<p>How global is global? Is China global on its own?</p>

<p>Is it wholly online or blended?<br />
Is it about altruism or is it market driven? (is this a necessary <em>or</em>, or is it a possible <em>and</em>?<br />
- partners - global or regional?)</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Alistair Shrimpton, Skype</strong></p>

<p>Skype want to enable the world's conversations.<br />
Skype perceive themselves as enablers - product development is key.<br />
Global product and global point of view.</p>

<p>One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.</p>

<p>Conversations are more than just about voice.</p>

<p>Cluetrain manifesto: 'markets are conversations'.</p>

<p>Skype - small company in terms of staff; 1% of users using paid for services keep it free for the rest (85% of whom don't realise paid for services are available).</p>

<p>Aim to make the hard look easy - hide the hard stuff from the user.</p>

<p>Skype champions privacy, very secure ('military grade' security).</p>

<p>Skype - built around extremely rapid innovation. Product development is what Skype do.</p>

<p>Locally disruptive. If you think something will happen, get their first...</p>

<p>Open APIs, active developer community.</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Chris Yapp, Microsoft</strong></p>

<p>"How can a global online university maximise the potential for good?"</p>

<p>So what's the challenge?</p>

<p>- the world is becoming increasingly project driven rather than insitutionally driven?</p>

<p>So identify the challenge, then work out what collaborations and partnerships are required to address the challenge.</p>

<p>Fundamental challenge appears to hooking up reserch that solves problems to people who need the knowledge via teaching of the research knowledge at all levels.</p>

<p>So - become a portal to global knowledge base.</p>

<p>Glolbal online knowledge bank exploited by GOU/teaching instituion to address fundamental challenges in maximising public good.</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Q & A</strong></p>

<p>JC - radical business model change seems to be required, but what is the model for that?</p>

<p>VC - we have been thinking about business models for serveral years, but won;t be something to happen overnight. Need for largescale pilot.</p>

<p>WV - focus on core competencies and commoditise those. Play to your strengths. Amazon stength is playing at scale [as is OU]. Continue to do what you're good at but in new ways.</p>

<p>Can a transition from trad-business to e-business be evolutionary rather than evolutionary.<br />
VC - a step-change, switch from one model to the other would be hard to achieve. BUT difficult to maintain two business models (one old, one new) side-by-side.<br />
SH - we know HE has its problems, but if we don't fix it perhaps an upstart will (cf. Ryan Air) and their disruption may not be better.<br />
WV - who is the customer? are we really serving our customers, where offerings are ubiquitous, and it becomes possible to mix-and-match.<br />
SD - it is possible to be innovated out of existence. Need to ask why we are doing what we do, what the purpose/point is. OU is trying to accomplish a social value/goal.</p>

<p>MarcE - a fundamental change is happening but education typically doesn't grok it wholesale and may adopt technology bits piecemeal. How does HE go for it? Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time? <br />
SH - if you hit the tough targets, you've got it made. Size is everything. OU has the scale to make the play. 18 months to make the play. The curve is accelerating - it really is this time.<br />
WV - is a global university a desirable thing? If so, te online is almost a given.<br />
SD - Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time?  Because this time they are making laws against it, which suggests it is ubiquitous.<br />
MS - if it's to happen, 3 things required: 1) people need to come together; if GOU, it needs government and corporate support; maybe transformation over 10-15 yr period and when we look back it will have happened.<br />
CY - who isn't here? People like GSK who have to operate across regions, across skill sets etc.<br />
WV - arts and creative industries need representation.<br />
SB - there is momentum this time; many HE people investing in online learning to enhance campus experience NOT a global market. So - now may be the time when we could have first mover advantage towards  GOU.<br />
VC - common sense dictates we need to stop reinventing Physics 101, Maths 101 etc.</p>

<p>Does current funding model support the investement necessary to go wholesale for a new technology solution? What management structure can support this level of change?</p>

<p>AS - someone has got to just go and do it, and be disruptive. SHould 8 people from the panel go away, lock themselves in a room, and make a decision about what's gonna happen by the end of the week? Yes - absolutely.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>??]</p>

<p>WV - release early, release often.<br />
MR - with 1 million alumni and 200k students, the OU should turn itself into a business...<br />
CY - HE sector is likely to have individual institutions failing. HE has the desire to do everything in a vertical organisation. If you can't be world class in a particular area, get someone else to it.<br />
SD - what's the goal? To get everybody educated for free? SO ask the question: what do we need to do to move ourselves to wards that goal, or the goal of free education for everybody in the world.</p>

<p>[Google want to organise the world's knowledge; skype want to get evryone talking. Should we want to be striving for 'A free education for everyone' .]</p>

<p>SH - alumni are assets. and the OU has lots of alumni.<br />
MR - education has to be paid for by the future wealth it creates; cf. microcredit arrangements where the introduction of mobile phones increases the wealth of the village.</p>

<p>JN - two strands: 1) how to reinvent the OU; 2) does the idea of a Global University make sense? The idea of the OU metamorphosing into into a GOU make sense - no; a global oU would have to be a networked organisation and whilst the OU might be a seed crystal it can;t be the final thing.<br />
MR - the process of producing content is an important part of the seed corn contribution.<br />
SH - it may not be the OU who does this, but the alternative is scarey...the OU has quality process etc. etc and the alternatives don't necessarily have those built in in the way they are built in to the OU. <br />
WV - being first is hard. Being number 25 is easy- - it's just copying. To be first will be incredibly hard. Does global also mean delivering Polish content in UK?<br />
CY - Need to get the best brains here in an R&D centre to crack the problem.<br />
MS - the OU could and should have a role - the ethos, appreciation of the importance of partnership, etc. Need to pull in government becuase as well as cash, government IS influential.<br />
SD - it is unlikely for there to be a single thing that would be the GU. A GU is unlikely to be a content delivery vehicle. The model will be learning and community model, learning as conversation, or communities of practice model. Commercial focus is on product, but learning is about conversation not product.  </p>

<p>?? - How do academics as designers of learning experiences fit into the model? What are my job prospects?<br />
PM - Amazon is 24-7, whereas HE has scheduled start dates. How do we move to the 24-7 model?<br />
?? - radical change is proposed, but our current model is highly regarded? How do we avoid throwing the baby out with ithe bathwater? Should we start a new venture?</p>

<p>WV - digital stuff is not necessarily good, because it brings with it attention deficit, and difficulty in making decisions. Teachers may move away from being content producers to guides.<br />
CY - potential market that is currently poorly served is the over-50s.</p>
