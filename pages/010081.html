<h3 class="title">Pesky RSS Feeds, They Turn into All Sorts...</h3>

<p>A quick ack to <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/">Stuart Brown</a> who's picked up the 'so what can we do with these here OpenLearn content RSS feeds then?' baton and started running like crazy with it...</p>

<p>Today was a heads up to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/19955/Computers-bits-bytes">T171 on Scribd</a>. The route to this upload was an <a href-="http://xfruits.com/">xfruits RSS2PDF</a> conversion. Of course, now the content is in Scribd, it's available as a Word doc (just need the bookmarklet now to open this into Zoho ot Google docs...).</p>

<p><img alt="scribdT171.png" src="./scribdT171.png" width="1043" height="479" border="0" /></p>

<p>Scribd also offers an audio version of the file, supposedly, but all I get is 'dash dash dash...'</p>

<p>Anyway, that's not really a problem because Stuart also tried the feed in <a href="http://en.blog.vocalfruits.com/">VocalFruits</a> and he mentioned it worked okay (public feeds aren't available yet).</p>

<p>Stuart's also been trying feeds out in various mobile browsers/feed readers, like the (secret) Grazr one and - err - a couple of others I cant find the links to, offhand... I'm not sure if he's tried it out inthe <a href="http://m.netvibes.com/">mobile Netvibes</a> feed reader though (how contrived was that link?!).</p>

<p>Just by the by, the OU has been looking at an XML to whatever production route fro several years now (and I believe have something available that's pretty reliable - at least, for documents written using the OU XML schema (which I guess is pretty close to the one used to release LabSpace XML).</p>

<p>The <em>ad hoc</em>, multi-format publication route described above is probably brittle as anything, but I reckon I could produce readable PDFs, Word docs, MP3s, RTFs, mobile browseable, widget readable versions of any text/image based OpenLearn content in at most an hour or two. Such is the good enough nature of - and widespread support for - RSS...</p>

<p>I'm sure LTS can also do the 'publish in any format' trick, far more reliably, and in a much shorter time than I can, too... (wanna race? ;-) But maybe the point is that it's not that clever in design terms (that is, almost anyone can use a variety of third party tools to achieve a similar effect), it's achieving the required reliability and scaleability that takes the effort.</p>

<p>Finally for today, another weak link: for readers who've been tinkering with OpenLearn materials, maybe even playing with some of the <a href="./009142.html">OpenLearn course content feeds</a>, there's a call just gone out for the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php">openlearn 2007 conference</a>, taking place on 30-31 October 2007 in Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>The conference is free if you register in time and promise to talk, so I'm thinking maybe I should try and submit something...</p>
