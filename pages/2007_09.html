<!--
<p>I was shocked to find in my email this morning the sad news that Jacquie Bennett, active member of the eLearning community and a passionate advocate of ways in which Second Life might be used to support the OU mission on CETLment Island and elsewhere, had died whilst away at a conference.</p>

<blockquote>Jacquie Bennett was a tutor on T171 and then T175 in R03, but many of you will have come across her in other roles such as conference moderator, COLMSCT research associate, Second Life enthusiast and much else besides.&nbsp; 

<div align="center"><a title="JB SL Avatar" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1463438178/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1199/1463438178_ac6ae2b5eb_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></div> 
We were shocked to hear that she died suddenly and unexpectedly from a brain haemorrhage whilst at a conference in Austria earlier this week.&nbsp; She was there presenting some of the work she had done with the OU on using Second Life for teaching and learning - she went to bed with a headache and was found by hotel staff the next morning.&nbsp; She leaves a husband and two young children.

<!--
<p>When the Facebook application platform launched a month or two ago, I thought about trying to put together a quick app or two, but somehow never got round to it, partly because I didn't fancy wading through the documentation, partly because Facebook is - at the end of the day - just another site with its own, proprietary interface standards.</p>

<p>For anyone who wants to put their own application onto Facebook today, however, the situation is much different.</p>

<p>At one extreme are applications that provide a conduit for you to get content of your own choosing onto your Facebook profile. <a href="http://feedonomics.grazr.com/index.php/archives/120">Grazr</a> is one example - it allows you to pipe and display the contents of an OPML feed of your choosing within Facebook:</p>

<p><a style="border: 0pt none ;" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5111858570808554226"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RvD4SU8UcvI/AAAAAAAAAqs/OzzqaFgrc1Y/s800/grazrFBaudio.png" style="border: 0pt none ;" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2352149512">MyStuff</a> is an application that allows you cut'n'paste embed code from other sites into your MyStuff app. This sort of "generic container" has started to appear on the webtops recently, like the <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/Community/Content/Flakes.aspx?moduleKey=340849">PageFlakes Anything Flake</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Here's my personal Mogulus TV channel in the MyStuff panel,  which plays content I've popped into it 24 hours a day, and lets me - or anyone who visits my Facebook profile page - stumble across programmes I know of are interest to me...</p>

<p><a title="Mogulus in Facebook MyStuff app" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1452424806/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1097/1452424806_4bd437c69f_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>What this means is that I can get feed content and embeddable widgets of my own choosing into Facebook, which is neat, whether or not the original source has developed their own Facebook app.</p>

<p>But what about developing my <em>own</em> app?</p>

<p>Here are three ways that I know of, all of which require you to install the Facebook developer app, so you can get a key for your new application: <br />
<ul><li><a href="http://dapper.wordpress.com/2007/09/26/dapper-facebook-appmaker-now-open-to-public/"><em>Dapper Facebook AppMaker</em></a>: Dapper is a web app that lets you quickly and easily define a screenscraper and generate various outputs from the scraped data (such as an XML output, or an RSS feed). The Dapper Facebook AppMaker will build a Facebook application around the output of one or more Dapps  -just follow the instructions and fill in a couple of form fields. For example, in this app I have added two panels - one that displays a direct RSS feed from an OpenLearn Course Unit (with "issues"), the other which provides a search interface over OpenLearn content:</p>

<p><a title="Dapper Appmaker App in Facebook" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/1451629035/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1203/1451629035_6ba2cb75ae_m.jpg" border="0" /></a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!260.entry"><em>Microsoft Popfly Facebook block</em></a>: Popfly is MicroSoft's mashup tool; the Popfly Facebook block provides you with access to your own profile information and a tool for deploying your mashup application back into Facebook; (just by the by, Popfly also has a block that integrates with Dapper);</li><br />
<li><a href="http://docs.widgetbox.com/developers/app-accelerator"><em>Widgetbox App Accelerator</em></a>: if you are a widget builder, and have registered your widget with <a href="http://widgetbox.com">Widgetbox</a>, you can grab a Facebook developer key and turn the widget into a standalone Facebook app simply by working through a form based wizard.</li><br />
<li>[UPDATE] <a href="http://blog.ning.com/2007/06/spread_the_love.html">Ning Facebook Integration</a> enables you to add videos, music, podcasts, and photo slideshows that appear on Ning network pages to Facebook as standalone Facebook apps.</li></ul><br />
Whilst Facebook application development is still probably one-for-the-techies, there's no doubt that it's getting easier to deploy apps of your own creation in Facebook... </p>

<p>If you actually want to write some code of your own, Digital Web magazine has a short article on geting started in PHP: <a href="ttp://www.digital-web.com/articles/building_facebook_applications/">How To Build A Facebook Application</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon have made available a set of resources that take you through the process of building a scaleable Facebook app using Amazon web services: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=72">Amazon Web Services for Facebook Developers<a/></p>

<p>PS Here's something interesting for anyone who wants to host their own Facebook app - a preconfigured Amazon cloud image: <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/10/helloworld-face.html">"HelloWorld" Facebook Application AMI</a></p>

<p>PPS if you know of an existing web page application you want to turn into a facebook app simply by displaying it in an iframe, you can develop the app without any coding, additional hosting etc etc: <a href="http://gathadams.com/2007/06/18/how-to-write-a-facebook-application-in-10-minutes/">How to write a FaceBook Application in 10 minutes</a> (check out <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010778.html">several example apps built using this technique</a).</p>

<p>A recent TechCrunch post - <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/25/graspr-steps-into-the-crowded-instructional-video-ring/">Graspr Steps into the Crowded Instructional Video Ring</a> handily grouped a set of links to different instructional video search websites. [UPDATE - in an update to the original post, it also links to <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/howdoi">How do I...</a> :-)]</p>

<p>As I've been looking for a reason to check out any recent changes to the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google Custom Search Engine</a> tool, I thought I'd use those sites to seed a tiny vertical instructional video search engine - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/howdoi">How do I...</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psychemedia/1442260662/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1392/1442260662_b9e83ca9c7_o.png" alt="howdoi.png" style="border: 0px none ; width: 557px; height: 343px;" /></a></p>

<p>Ideally, of course, the results would have small, embedded preview windows of the video clips, in the same way that embedded videos are displayed in the main Google listings, for example...</p>

<p>Still, for a 20 minute hack, I guess I can't be too fussy...</p>

<p>PS the logo was created using the <a href="http://creatr.cc/creatr/">Web 2.0 Logo Creatr</a>.</p>

<p>PPS it's simple enough to add the search box to your own page:<br />
<!-- Google CSE Search Box Begins  --><form action="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/howdoi" id="searchbox_009190243792682903990:qppoopa3lxa"><input type="hidden" name="cx" value="009190243792682903990:qppoopa3lxa" /> <input type="hidden" name="cof" value="FORID:9" /><br />

<p>Just use the following code in your own page:</p>

<h3 class="title">Save Game As Source...</h3>

<!--
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010121.html">Re:Play - The Future of Sports Gaming? "I'll Take it From Here..."</a>, I daydreamed about "sports simulations in which the state of the game at which the player starts is a duplicate of the state of the game in the real world". The idea there was that from the TV coverage of a game you could capture the state of a snooker table mid-frame, for example, or the lie of the ball from a couple of shots in to a par 5 golf hole, and then "play on" via your console. </p>

<p>Whilst we're not there yet, the launch of Halo 3 turns up this interesting snippet as it goes <a href="http://www.last100.com/2007/09/25/halo-3-is-out-how-microsofts-strategy-extends-beyond-gaming/">beyond gaming</a>:<br />
<blockquote>... Saved Films, allows players to save a copy of a game play to their console's hard drive so that it can be reviewed later on. Lots of games, especially in the sports genre, have a similar feature, but Halo 3 is the first console game to really implement it well. Interestingly, <strong>Saved Films are not video files but instead contain the actual game data</strong> [emphasis mine]. This enables users to replay the game at any resolution, and to change things like camera angles. Saved Films might seem like a minor feature at first, but I think it's really important for two reasons. Number one, it allows players to create clips and screenshots that can be shared with other players, effectively enabling mashups and remixes of Halo 3. Number two, it's the first step toward allowing players to script their own storylines and movies.</blockquote></p>

<p>The ability to save game play as <em>data</em> also resonates with the idea of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010108.html">releasing music as Garageband 'source' files</a>, for example...</p>

<p>The future is bright, the future is "Save As Data"! ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/games" rel="tag">games</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gaming" rel="tag">gaming</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Over the last year or so, there have been occasional mutterings about how we might go about producing 'contentless' courses - that is, courses light on OU sourced content that reuse third party materials, wherever possible.</p>

<p>Many courses in the past have drawn on third party material, of course, most typically by "wrapping" readings from a set text with a study guide. Our <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T228">Cisco Certified Networking Course</a> goes one further, by wrapping Cisco's own elearning materials with some of our own assessment material.</p>

<p>The role of the study guide is to pace progress through set books and support learning by means of additional self-assessment material and short reflective exercises, as well as providing extended notes on particular topics.</p>

<p>But as far as I know, there haven't been any courses produced to date that have sought to exploit a significant amount of 'open content licensed' materials and incorporate them in our own teaching materials.</p>

<p>In fact, just <em>how</em> we might make use of online, third party materials, I'm not sure, because as far as I can tell, "open content" licenses don't really lubricate the process of reusing such materials within our own courses, behind closed paywalls at all...</p>

<p>(If our students are customers, and we're adopting the language of commerce, then "paywall" is the correct term, I think?)</p>

<p>For example, I'd love to be able to embed a document a from Scribd, or a presentation from Slideshare, into a set of online materials, along with a YouTube movie and a maybe an ITConversation or two, but while grabbing the embed code is easy, getting the rights clearance is not...</p>

<p>What I would like to be able to do - what I would <em>love</em> to be able to do - is search for content licensed in such a way that I know I can embed it in my own online course materials without rights hassles, that I can archive a copy of the material in case it disappears from the orginal site, that I don't have to worry about embedding someone else's Flash player in our course materials...</p>

<p>I'd also like to think I could structure an online course in such a way that I could use resources like this <a href="http://kongregate.com/games/pixelate/understanding-games-episode-1">game about the history of games</a> without having to worry that the quality is not quite up to scratch or that most of the time students are being referred 'optionally' to third party sites because we can't get the third party material needed for a contentless course onto our own site... </p>

<p>But it feels late, tonight, I'm tired, and my imagination is lacking...</p>

<p>One of the reasons I started looking at various ways of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=visualising%20courses">visualising OU courses and qualifications</a> was a conversation in which the main topic of conversation was how difficult it was for our students to see at-a-glance the possible courses they needed to take to get a particular qualification, given the courses they have already taken, <em>or</em> easily ascertain which qualification they may have made good progress towards given a set of individual courses they may have taken out of personal or professional interest.</p>

<p>Looking over the following treemap a couple of days ago, it struck me how much like a courses and qualifications bingo card it was, or at least, could be:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5092199380734780290"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RqsgW24pI4I/AAAAAAAAALs/dVKEFywquQM/s800/manyeyesTreemapQuals.png" /></a></p>

<p>Given a set of course codes corresponding to the courses taken by a particular person, I could quite easily see these being crossed off on the card.</p>

<p>Where two or more courses are part of an excluded combination within a particular qualification, they could be grouped together by a prominent border, and completion of one course would gray out others in the combination. The border around the excluded combination would be of use when no courses within that combination had been taken yet.</p>

<p>One thing the above treemap representation does not denote is the relative points weighting of different courses - some are rated at 30 points, others at 60, for example. An undergraduate degree typically requires satisfactory completion of 360 points worth of study.</p>

<p>Ideally, this should be reflected in some way. If we allow ourselves to have blank squares within the confines of each qualification, then area could be used to denote points value.</p>

<p>If nothing else, it could be quite an interesting addition to a MySpace personal page!</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Codes - A Web 2.OU Crown Jewel</h3>

<!--
<p>In the days when this blog was dominated by library related concerns, I used to spend a lot of time working out how to use ISBNs as <em>pivot points</em> for various book related searches; (librarians, of course, don't rate ISBNs - they'd rather focus on the city a book was printed in...).</p>

<p>At the time, I produced a simple script to generate URLs that accepted an ISBN key - Amazon look ups, for example, or book cover images - you can find a link to the page from here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006058.html">ISBN Playground</a>. (The list may be a little out-of-date/increasingly incomplete by now...)</p>

<p>Somewhen around that  time, (or perhaps even before, in the days before I blogged everything?) I also dabbled with a couple of webservices, in particular a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/bookSearch.php">course related book search</a> (as well as an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/courseSearch.php">alternative course search</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112706059878402306"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RvP7ErwKCQI/AAAAAAAAAtw/Q-BdqOzmHm8/s800/ousefulBookSearch.png" /></a></p>

<p>This service looked up the set books associated with a course (in fact, it looked up the books students had to <em>purchase</em> for the course) and provided links for them through to the OU Library, as well as on Amazon and elsewhere, and also provided a couple of links to related course pages.</p>

<p>The service is no longer maintained, so many of the courses listed may have ceased presentation by now (and many of the newer current courses won't be listed), but it was an interesting exercise and one I;d like to revisit one day; not least because I'd like to put together a full RESTful API for it (and maybe tidy up the current SOAP API).</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, as a precursor to that - possibly - I thought I'd start collecting URLs that are 'keyed' with an OU course code. This list is likely to grow over time (I'll try to maintain it), so if you're interested, it's probably worth bookmarking this page and revisiting it every so often...<br />
<ul><li>Courses and qualifications pages: <em>http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01<strong>CODE</strong></em>.

<p>It's worth noting, however, that the library database is sparsely populated and not all courses have items populating the above feeds.</p>

<!--
<p>One of the key strengths (so it is said) of the OU course production process is the course team approach (Google turns this up as a good hit for that topic: <a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED119665&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED119665">Designing Multi-Media Courses for Individualized Study: The Open University Model and its Relevance to Conventional Universities.</a> - check the date.. 1975?!).</p>

<p>Whilst production timescales can run into years for large, 60 credit point course, production of our online 10 point short courses (equating to approx. 100 hours of study, including assessment and online conferencing) is of the order 6 to 9 months, all told.</p>

<p>One of the things we are experimenting with on a new short course is the use of <a href="htp://docs.google.com">Google docs</a> for document creation. Yesterday, two of use were editing the same document  - the first week's content - at the same time, albeit different sections.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to chat to <a href="http://design.open.ac.uk/cham/index.htm">Karen</a>, the colleague I was working with (hopefully, rather than against...) about this, but a couple of things struck me as I walked the dog last night:<br />
<ul><li>a typical authoring process in the course team approach is for an academic to produce a working draft of a substantial piece of course material, and circulate it for comment from course team members; the comments are then taken on board and another draft produced, again for comment, before a final version is produced. An external assessor also comments on the final draft. In a paired/collaborative authoring environment, changes can be observed at a fine level, and opportunities for discussing the shape of the document arise in the form of an ongoing conversation. In this way, the document can evolve as if it were a conversation.</li><br />
<li>Karen and both work frequently from home. Paired, collaborative authoring displays the presence of the other person editing the same document, which provides a feeling of social presence that can be lacking for homeworkers; (compare this with working in an open plan office, which I don't think I'd like to do...)</li><br />
<li>authoring a large piece of course material can be a significant undertaking, and potentially risky, if, for example, a draft is not well-liked by the commenting course team. Working to a deadline that may be months hence means slippage often occurs - if I have 6 months to author something, I don't need to start now... In contrast, the shared/collaborative document space provides an opportunity for working directly with someone via a written conversation, over a reasonably short timescale;</li><br />
<li>note that I'm not talking about writing a classic, Socratic dialogue, but evolving a living document through conversation; as an organisation developing distance materials, we developed a <a href="http://www-iet.open.ac.uk/pp/D.G.F.Rowntree/future_dl.htm"><em>tutorial in print</em></a> model, that has itself evolved over time as new "CMC" technologies have become available, allowing us to support interaction with - and between - students in new ways. I don't know if the draft material we are producing at the moment will benefit from the ongoing conversation myself and Karen will be having during its production, but it's an experiment that I think is worth trying.</li><br />
<li>cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>: <em>Pair programming requires two programmers to participate in a combined development effort at one workstation.</em>; and also <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/archive/2004_07_01_mpdarchive.html#108968593465871236"> Initial Experiences with Pair-Writing</a> (which was done over the shoulder with a single keyboard). This reminds me that several problematic sections of a previous course I worked on were written in an over-the-shoulder pair writing sort of way; pair writing in Google docs is maybe not so immediate - we're  not arguing over every word at the time it is written (although we could... either in the document directly, or by using comments or IM to talk through a difficult sentence, for example) - but there is the opportunity to both solicit and provide <em>timely</em> feedback at any level of granularity (section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, word even).</li></ul>Of course, Karen may not agree... (maybe we should have written this post conversationally...!)</p>

<p>PS also see this <a href="http://teaching.mrbelshaw.co.uk/index.php/2007/09/22/what-can-i-use-google-presentations-for/">post about collaborative production of a Google presentation</a>...</p>

<h3 class="title">Grazr 2.0 Beta  - Drag'n'Drop Feed Management</h3>

<p>[UPDATE: Grazr 2 is coming out of beta any time... the beta site is public - <a href="http://beta.grazr.com">http://beta.grazr.com</a>]</p>

<p>I got an invite onto the Grazr 2.0 beta today (thanks, Adam :-) and spent an hour or so this evening pottering around with it.</p>

<p>(For the wow bits - scroll down to the end of the the post and check out the 2.0 goodness editor :-)</p>

<p>The new front page is far more appealing than the current front page, with a two column layout that displays recent reading lists in the main panel, and admin info down the right hand side:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112015392949433090"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGG6k8UcwI/AAAAAAAAArY/NChXtTgF2NM/s800/grazrFrontPage.png" /></a></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to know what sort of algorithm is being used to display the 'recent' feeds.. is there a secret ingredient or two in there, such as reading list popularity, or authority of the reading list 'author' (or should that be <em>compiler</em>?) as well as recency?</p>

<p>You'll also notice the images associated with each reading list - these are openly licensed and taken from flickr (even so, is attribution required <em>somewhere</em>? [Apparently, "If you look at any Read page with an image, you'll notice a photo credit back to the author and a CC link to the license. "]), and can be associated with a reading list when you first create'n'save it.</p>

<p>Your own personal reading list has a similar look'n'feel, although there are a few user controls associated with each reading list: <em>share</em>, <em>create a widget</em>, <em>edit</em> and <em>delete</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112015405834334994"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGG7U8UcxI/AAAAAAAAArg/O8u5JWHLczM/s800/grazrReadingLists.png" /></a></p>

<p>The share option takes you to a new page with an email share feature.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112015431604138802"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGG808UczI/AAAAAAAAAr0/2S8LuXp6SQI/s800/grazrShare.png" /></a></p>

<p>The share page is also linked to from the page you get to by clciking on the feed image or title - what I call the 'read' page for no good reason other than to follow the URL convention!</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112015423014204194"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGG8U8UcyI/AAAAAAAAArs/WRmhmiy-SVo/s800/grazrReadPage.png" /></a></p>

<p>This provides a link to the OPML URL of the reading list as well as embed and pop-up code.</p>

<p>To get further customisation of the widget, you can always visit the <em>Create a Widget</em> page (which is the one that you can reach from the Grazr widget itself):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112017566202884962"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGI5E8Uc2I/AAAAAAAAAsk/FP3uwCEr9Zc/s800/grazrCreateWidget.png" /></a></p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - now for the real 2.0 goodness: the reading list editor. This drag'n'drop environment lets you add feeds (or page links) if you know the URL, as well as text elements. GrazrScript editing is not available in the current beta...</p>

<p>The feed items can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. The ability to add folders means that it's trivial to organise your reading list. Changing the name of a preloaded feed is simple - just double click and edit away to your heart's content.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112015440194073410"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGG9U8Uc0I/AAAAAAAAAr8/XG0n9EP67q8/s800/grazrEdit.png" /></a></p>

<p>There's no preview feature on the editor page - you have to save and close back to the read view for that - but that's a small price to pay.</p>

<p>The drag'n'drop goodness only starts there, however - because links and highlighted text can be dragged from any other browser window and dropped into the editor pane.</p>

<p>The first way of doing this is from the <em>Discover</em> panel links: simply drag a link from a Grazr widget and drop it into your own reading list, where it'll be recognised for what it is (text link, RSS feed, OPML feed etc.).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5112021350069072754"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RvGMVU8Uc3I/AAAAAAAAAsw/Ba3nDkj3Igs/s800/grazrDiiscover.png" /></a></p>

<p>If you have other browser windows open, highlighted text, links, links to RSS feeds and so on can all be dragged onto the editor panel. Links from the borwser address bar can also be dragged and dropped into the editor.</p>

<p>I would have like to see autodiscovery of feeds from pages whose URLs are dropped into the editor, but Adam explained to me patiently (yet again) how autodiscovery just confuses the majority of people who don't get the difference between feeds and web pages anyway (and don't we all know how true that is!).</p>

<p>Maybe the Grazr front page needs a "Grazring the Web in Plain English" video?</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - if you're looking for an OPML manager, Grazr 2.0 should be out of beta soon, and it'll be well worth your while having a play with.</p>

<p>At the other end of the expertise scale, if you wonder what those square orange icons all over the web are, get yourself a Grazr 2.0 account, create a reading list and drop a few of them into the editor, then use a full page Grazr widget to display the result :-)</p>

<p>For example - here's <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearn/opml/openlearntopics.opml">OpenLearn in a Grazr widget</a></p>

<p>[The beta is closed but open... <a href="http://feedonomics.grazr.com/index.php/archives/173">find out more here</a>]</p>

<p>PS here's an interesting educational use of Grazr: <a href="http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/09/building-course-reading-list-in-grazr.html">Building a course reading list in Grazr</a></p>

<!--
<p>The first programme in the second series of Radio 4's IT magazine programme <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/clickon/index.shtml">Click On</a> aired at 4.30 pm on Monday (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/clickon">listen again here</a>), and will be filling that slot for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>As with all OU/BBC co-productions, there's an Open2.net website too: <a href="http://www.open2.net/clickon/index.html">Open2 Click On Website</a>.</p>

<p>To support the series, the Open2 folks are rolling a multipart tutorial on getting started with Netvibes: <a href="http://www.open2.net/sciencetechnologynature/computing/web2workshop/personal_portals.html">Open2.net Web 2.0 Workshop</a></p>

<p>The first programme featured a story about the huge IT project behind the Beijing Olympics, as well as the use of GPS tracking for monitoring bird migration. The final item - on the nature of web search - is something we might be even able to use to set up a couple of topics in our <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a> info skills course.</p>

<p>The audio for series 1 of Click On (broadcast earlier this year) is still available from the Radio 4 Click On website, or via a Grazr widget (if you have a Real Audio browser extension installed): <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?view=o&theme=gloss_silver&addbar=off&file=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On Series 1</a>.</p>

<p><a style="border:0" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5111858570808554226"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RvD4SU8UcvI/AAAAAAAAAqs/OzzqaFgrc1Y/s800/grazrFBaudio.png" /></a></p>

<p>I'm still trying to decide whether or not it 'works for me' when embedded in FaceBook - that is, whether I really want to consume content in the FaceBook environment? (Speaking of which, Martin posted some <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/09/facebook-and-tw.html">interesting thoughts about Facebook stickiness</a> earlier today...)</p>

<p>If I get a chance this weekend, I'll try to revamp that feed with a bit more content from OpenLearn, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>One of the things that's be carefully considered in our current internal broadcast review is how to recapture something of the traditional teaching related broadcast model, where broadcast programmes were used as part of course delivery, as well as being free to view by anyone who happened to tune in at the time.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Click On will provide some relevant, related listening for some of our IT programme courses, and maybe even a clip or two we can link to from within them?</p>

<p>(For a taste of fondly remembered, late night/early morning OU BBC2 broadcasts, there are one or two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=105C3A71B494F906">classic OU clips on YouTube</a> (and here are some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=EBAEA5BB4E95F0D2">spoof OU shorts</a>... What I'm waiting for is the techno 'pa pah, pa pahh' remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=225ED958E9EE0E08">classic OU idents</a> ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">feedshow (feedpresenter) - Shortcut URL Splash Screen</h3>

Having just been tipped off by Clever Clogs about snipr, a TinyURL-like service with a simple API, I thought I'd start to integrate it into feedshow (feedshow launcher), my updated feed powered presenter tool. So here's what's new - if...
<!--
<p>Having just been tipped off by <a href="http://www.cleverclogs.org/">Clever Clogs</a> about <a href="http://snipr.com/">snipr</a>, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL</a>-like service with a simple API, I thought I'd start to integrate it into <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010531.html">feedshow</a> (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow">feedshow launcher</a>), my updated feed powered presenter tool.</p>

<p>So here's what's new - if you fire up a <em>Master</em> feedshow control panel (from <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/feedshowMaster.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/feedshowMaster.php</a>) you'll get a new button: <em>Splash</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5110560249131239650"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RuxbeDyzCOI/AAAAAAAAApY/aYyDER8GQNk/s800/feedshowSplashURL.png" /></a></p>

<p>(To pipe your own feed into the presenter, just add a <em>?url=</em> argument to the feedshow URL, pointing to your feed URL.)</p>

<p>Clicking on the <em>Splash</em> button will recover a tiny Snipd URL for the current feedShow and display it in the main presentation frame.</p>

<p>Audience members can simply enter this URL and reach the presentation (<em>without</em> the <em>Splash</em> button). They can then navigate through the presented links at their own speed.</p>

<p>The displayed URL is also a link, that loads into the top frame of the window. If you click on it, it will load the 'normal' client feedshow presentation (i.e. the same one that the audience will load), <em>not</em> the "Master" controller, and you will lose access to the <em>Splash</em> button.</p>

<p>The <em>Splash</em> button can be clicked at any time during a presentation to show latecomers the feedshow URL; clicking on <em>&lt;Current&gt;</em> will then return you to the current presentation webpage.</p>

<p>[UPDATE: to make it easier to launch a feedshow, I've added a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow">feedshow launcher</a>.</p>

<p><small>There may be one or teething troubles with the sniprURL/client launcher if feed URLs are long and complex, but I'll patch the escapes if, as, and when I find they're not working!.</small>]</p>

<p>One thing I've been considering is to provide a 'synching client' that will load the same page as the one the presenter is currently displaying. I think that the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009187.html">statex - Global Variables for the Web</a> app might be suitable for this, so if I get a spare couple of hours over the next week or two, I'll try and have a bit of a play... :-)</p>

<p>I started to tinker with an OU campus map too (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&z=17&om=1">OU Campus map (Google maps)</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&output=nl&msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a">KML</a>, but it's way too clunky at the moment).</p>

<p>I also did myself a private map overlay with the new <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/mapmixer">Yahoo MapMixer</a> which lets you upload and overlay your own map on top of Yahoo maps, then embed the result in your own page.</p>

<p>I'd post a link, but as I 'stole' the campus map, a screenshot will have to suffice.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5110059271260932306"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RuqT1TyzCNI/AAAAAAAAApE/fgF9wsrFN_g/s800/mapmixer.png" /></a></p>

<p>Producing the mix was trivial - simply upload your map, zoom in to a Yahoo map to where you want to place the overlay, then pick two points on the uploaded map and two corresponding locations on the Yahoo map. The MapMix app wil then do the rest :-)</p>

<p>You'll notice that the campus map is not quite to scale - the roundabouts at the bottom should overlap, for example, but with only two sighting points - and no stretch transformations of the uploaded image - an executive decision on the placement was called for!</p>

<p>Setting the level of transparency is also exposed as a public/user control on the map, which is a neat touch, I think...</p>

We need an enthusiastic individual who can hit the ground running to join our team and take on this important role.</em></li></ul></p>

<p>As ever, I have absolutley nothing to do with the appointment of any of the above. If you go for any of them, feel free or not to mention where you saw the ad, ping for for a coffee when you're on campus etc...</p>

<p>I don't normally do single item 'news relay' type posts, but here's one that may appeal to OU internal readers (and may be of interest to some of the more adventurous librarians out there!): <a href="http://digilablog.blogspot.com/2007/09/whats-in-digiquest.html">DigiQuest</a>, from the OU Library's <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/">DigiLab</a> ("a showcase for tools, technologies and resources illustrating how today's technology can nurture tomorrow's learners").</p>

<p>So what is a DigiQuest?</p>

<p>Well, it's a staff development activity that aims:<br />
<blockquote>To<br />
    * increase awareness and confidence in using the technologies in the Digilab<br />
    * consider their potential for use in delivering learning activities<br />
    * foster teambuilding across development areas<br />
by<br />
    * hands on discovery of Digilab based technologies<br />
    * Investigating navigational issues related to an assigned technology related topic<br />
    * Creating byte sized" multimedia presentations incorporating user generated content</p>

<p>The theme for the day can be negotiated. Themes need to be common to all types of technology being investigated, such as navigation. The chosen theme will run through both the Geocache treasure hunt exercise and the afternoon activity.</p>

<p>Attendees will be required to solve some clues and locate hidden caches on campus containing special tokens assigned to their team. The first cache is their "treasure hunt" expert. At each cache attendees must collect each token as attendees need to surrender these in the Digilab when their team has completed the hunt. Tokens will be traded for information to help the teams complete the afternoon's activity. Last team to empty a cache must bring the cache stash box back with them. Attendees will need to capture through stills, video and/or audio content:<br />
a. the short interview attendees have with the team's "expert"<br />
b. attendees and their team mates discovering each cache and its token</blockquote></p>

<p>As well as <em>Digiquests</em>, the DigiLab is also offering "Digibytes, light touch introductory sessions lasting half an hour to an hour".</p>

<p>If you haven't been over there yet, the Digilab is is located on the ground floor of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&amp;z=16&amp;om=1">OU Library</a>.</p>

<p>PS I wonder if they are going to set up a <a href="http://www.unype.com/">presence in Google Earth</a>?</p>

<p>PPS For internal readers again, DigiLab are running a technology use survey:<br />
<blockquote>Are you a technophile or technophobe?</p>

<p>Library Services, with the support of IET, are running a brief survey to gain a snapshot of the knowledge, expertise and confidence of Open University Staff regarding new technologies.</p>

<!--
<p>While I was away on holiday, one of the things I pondered but had no opportunity to blog was the potential for <em>daily learning</em> as a practical consequence of a positive attitude towards <em>lifelong learning</em>. It seems to me that <em>lifelong learning</em> is something we might value as a society, whereas <em>daily learning</em> is something far more practical - a learning equivalent of "Think global, act local".</p>

<p>So what is <em>daily learning</em>? Practical activity that demonstrates a lifelong learning attitude, maybe? Knowingly engaging in some sort of learning activity each day, potentially as the result of some sort of internal monologue (or dialogue?) in which we might ask ourselves one of the (journalistic?) questions: <em>who, what, where, when, how, why?</em> about ... anything, I guess.</p>

<p>News stories offer one particularly good, contextualised opportunity for daily learning, presenting us with situations where we might engage in our own analysis of a news story, or maybe looking at the wider context in which occurs. </p>

<p>So it was interesting to read see this post today "<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/09/07/nyt">'New York Times' Enters Distance Learning Market</a>" (via <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=41620">Downes</a>) which picked up on a New York Times Company press release ("<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-pressArticle&amp;ID=1048818&amp;highligh">The New York Times Introduces an Online Complement to College and University Courses, Providing Enhanced Classroom and Distance Learning</a>").</p>

<p>The press release states:<br />
<blockquote>The New York Times introduced today a new online initiative that pairs Times content with faculty course material for both credit-bearing and continuing education courses. Educators will now have the opportunity to select Times articles, archival content, graphics and multimedia content, including videos and Webcasts, gathered around specific subjects, and make them available to students online, along with other course materials. Students will benefit from access to thematic content that is drawn from the vast array of Times reporting on a countless number of issues.</p>

<p>This innovation is a significant expansion of The New York Times Knowledge Network, a program that has provided copies of the paper, accompanied by curriculum guides, to faculty at colleges and universities for several years, bringing the resources of The Times into classrooms as part of the learning experience. Now, with this new component of the Knowledge Network, Times content will be readily available to students online, whether they're enrolled in an on-campus course or continuing their education through a distance learning program.</p>

<p>In addition to enhanced course offerings for college students and lifelong learners, the Knowledge Network will serve as a global networking and professional and academic development resource for faculty, students and alumnae. Users will be able to share work with colleagues, create their own academic or professional ePortfolios (digital repositories of a person's work), invite peer review and establish professional contact with people around the globe based on common academic pursuits and research.</blockquote><br />
So - a learning network, with bundled content from NYT companies. Interesting...</p>

<p>Stephen also picked out the following out of the <em>insidehighered</em> post: "[Some of the online courses will also make use of Times content that is a centerpiece of the services being offered to colleges, on enrollment-based subscription plans. ] These packages will provide access to special packages of content - summaries of articles, interactive maps, video, audio, graphs - on a wide range of topics (the European Union, nanotechnology and so forth)."</p>

<p>It's easy to see how data mashups and interactive infographics could figure in these packages (see some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/">examples of New York Times interactive graphics</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, "Professors at institutions that subscribe would be able to make customized course Web pages, with their own content alongside these content packages." So first it was roll-your-own textbooks (e.g. O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.safariu.com/">SafariU</a>), now it's roll-your-own NYT supplements. (I wonder when the Economist will join in?!)</p>

<p>[UPDATE: Martin has just posted a nicely considered piece on this news announcement: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEdTechie/~3/154939315/nyt-enters-educ.html">NYT enters education market, and the changing nature of newspapers</a>]</p>

<p>The original press release goes on:<br />
<blockquote>This new component of Knowledge Network is available via the Epsilen(TM) Environment (<a href="http://www.epsilen.com">www.epsilen.com</a>), a newly developed Web-based software package that provides a wide range of tools and services for faculty members and students, including ePortfolios, Global Learning System (courseware), group collaboration, object sharing, blogs, messaging, and social and professional networking. Users receive a lifelong identity on the Epsilen(TM) system, enabling them to maintain their academic and professional ePortfolios throughout their careers, regardless of their affiliation with individual institutions.</blockquote><br />
Did you see that keyword?</p>

<p>"... Users receive a <em>lifelong</em> identity on the Epsilen(TM) system..."</p>

<p>How many HEIs offer <em>lifelong</em> access to their VLEs and personal portfolios, with free (or paid-for subscription) top-up, CPD or "contined interest" services to alumni, I wonder?</p>

<p>So what is Epsilen? Its front page proudly declares: <br />
<blockquote>WHAT IS EPSILEN?<br />
 Epsilen places social networking and ePortfolios in the center of global eLearning, creating a totally new environment for the next generation of learners and professionals. Some current Epsilen users describe Epsilen as an academic "MySpace" and "FaceBook", connecting peers to share knowledge and exchange objects.</blockquote></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't get in to Epsilen to see what it's like: "Please note that only U.S. higher educational email addresses are accepted for free registration. Educational email addresses are those that end with .edu. Exceptions can be made for non-educational email addresses and for institutions/communities that are Epsilen members."</p>

<p>If you do have a <em>.edu</em> email address and are a member of the Epsilen Environment, could you post a few screenshots, please? :-) It all sounds very <a href="http://www.elgg.org/">elgg</a>-like to me ;-)</p>

<p>PS grab yourself a coffee and then check out this 5 minute 'game'/interactive brochure: <a href="http://www.willyoujoinus.com/">Energyville</a>, developed by Chevron in association with, err, <a href="http://www.economistgroup.com/energyville.html">The Economist Group</a> ;-)<br />
<blockquote>Energyville, developed using data and content provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit, examines the economic, environmental and security opportunities and trade-offs associated with different energy sources. In order to provide fuel and power to their city's homes, offices, factories and vehicles, Energyville players must balance the same competing demands faced by policymakers, businesses and consumers every day. Spanning a period from present day to 2030, players manage the energy supply for their growing city through random events that affect their choices and highlight the consequences of their actions.<br />
...<br />
Energyville represents an average industrialised global city, with population and energy demands, uses and costs, based on projected patterns using data from the Economist Intelligence Unit and organisations such as the OECD and the Energy Information Administration. During the game, players must choose between eight prevalent energy sources to power their city up until 2015 and 10 different sources up until 2030. As players move through the game's phases they learn about the characteristics of the energy sources and negotiate real life scenarios that can affect their energy choices. The economical, environmental and security implications of their chosen energy portfolio are calculated using an energy management points system. Players can compare scores with other players, challenge a friend and debate the results...</blockquote><br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108867433496186418"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RuZX3OIaDjI/AAAAAAAAAms/EyJUYb2LMfY/s400/energyville1.png" /></a></p>

<p>I came away from the game with a raised awareness of some of the possible 'threats' to particular energy supplies, via the (random?) 'events' that disrupted things somewhen around 2020, an awareness that would probably influence my energy source selection if I was to play the game again (and try to improve my score!).<br />
A 'guided play' option for first time player uses pop-up post it notes to provide a basic in-game tutorial, although the interface is intuitive enough to use without instruction.</p>

<p>PPS The New York Times just added a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/new_york_times_launches_facebook_app.php">NYT daily news quiz Facebook app</a> to their portfolio too... It includes some cunning tricks to drive traffic to the New York Times website, too...</p>

<p>[UPDATE: the 'issue' with OpenLearn unit content feeds has now been resolved - all the feeds should be working properly now :-)]</p>

<p>Last week, I posted on the newly announced <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010540.html">OpenLearn RSS feeds</a>, without testing them in anything other than in a web browser (after all, they're just feeds, right? ;-). However, trying the feeds out last night, I found that whilst they worked okay in the browser, they didn't work with a wide variety of online services.</p>

<p>In particular (and insofar as I tested them out), OpenLearn feed subscription works fine with Google Reader, Pageflakes, RSS2PDF, Damia and FeedRinse but the feeds are not discovered or recognised at all by Bloglines, Grazr, Netvibes, Yahoo Pipes, Google mashup editor or Feedburner (I didn't try Popfly).</p>

<p>So what's going on?</p>

<p>A quick test with <a href="http://web-sniffer.net/">Web Sniffer</a> - an online tool for looking at http headers - reveals the problem: a hack to use a cookie and quiet guest login to the OpenLearn Moodle environment, presumably to provide a (naive?) way of trying to track the feed usage (a requirement of the OpenLearn research team).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108626769298722322"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RuV8-uIaDhI/AAAAAAAAAlk/zQixZIbaS0c/s800/openlearnMoodleCookie.png" /></a></p>

<p>Because the cookie'n'redirect hack is causing so much problem with such a wide variety of feed mashup tools, I'm hopeful that a fix will posted sooner rather than later (athough if you are a PHP hacker and know of a way of using curl or some other tool that will accommodate the handshake and will let me create a simple proxy/relay, please let me know!)</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason I'm guessing motivated the hack - obtaining feed user stats - got me thinking about how to collect such data, a problem that is not easy at the best of times (here's some discussion on <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-feed-tracking-is-hard">Why Feed Tracking is Hard</a>).</p>

<p>I use Feedburner for the OUseful.info feed, but they may not be the preferred option for many, particularly if you want to use a feed URL that is own your own domain*.</p>

<p><em>* There is a hack way around getting Feedburner stats for your own hosted feed URLs apparently, as demonstrated by this post on <a href="http://www.45n5.com/permalink/how-to-get-feedburner-stats-without-using-feedburn.html">How to Get Feedburner Stats WITHOUT Using Feedburner On Your Blog</a>, a trick that is picked up on in this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/feedburnerstats/">FeedBurner Stats</a> WordPress plugin, which gives you FeedBurner Stats without redirecting your users the FeedBurner feeds.</em></p>

<p>Keeping the stats collection in house, it's probably worth assuming that if there are large numbers of people subscribing to a feed, they will tend to be distributed over the more popular feed readers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.velospace.org/?p=15">How-To: Measuring RSS Readership</a> is a recent post reviewing the return of user subscriber numbers from the user agent of the main feed crawlers/readers.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/wordpress/plugins/feed-statistics/">Feed Statistics Plugin for Wordpress</a> (<a href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/category/feed-statistics/">latest news</a>) provides a clear (PHP) example of how to make use of these user-agent reports to provide estimated subscriber numbers for a particular feed.</p>

<p>How useful these numbers are is debatable, of course... becasue you don't know for sure how the number of "subscribers" relates to the number of people who actively read the feeds they have subscribed to!</p>

<!--
<p>Catching up on week or two old posts over a coffee just now, this one from the Nascent blog - <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2007/08/amazon_a_new_kind_of_publisher_1.html">Amazon: A New Kind of Publisher</a> - caught my eye with it's mention of Amazon's <a href="http://www.createspace.com/">CreateSpace</a> business.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.createspace.com/Special/AboutUs/PR/20070808_Books.jsp">original press release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>CreateSpace, part of the Amazon.com, Inc. group of companies (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the launch of a new online Books on Demand service. Also announced today, the company is no longer charging setup fees for books, audio CDs and DVDs. Authors, filmmakers and musicians can now offer their works to millions of customers on Amazon.com, CreateSpace.com and via their own free customizable eStore without any inventory, setup fees or minimum orders.<br />
...<br />
There are no setup fees or minimum orders for the CreateSpace on-demand service. Members are required to purchase and approve a proof copy of their book, CD, and/or DVD before titles can be produced on demand. Books published via the CreateSpace Books on Demand service are printed with high-quality, full-color paperback covers. Black-and-white or color interiors in multiple trim sizes can be selected as options. Members can also order high-quality copies of their book, DVD or CD at competitive wholesale prices.</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.createspace.com/BooksOnDemand">Books on Demand</a> service also offers 'publishers' the following as part of its listing service:</p>

<p><em>    *  Free ISBN will be assigned if you do not already have one<br />
    * Use Amazon's Search Inside!â„¢ feature for your book (what's this?)<br />
    * Amazon.com orders are eligible for Super Saver Shipping, One-day Shipping, and 1-Click ordering<br />
    * Your proof will normally ship within five business days after your order is placed</em></p>

<p>In many respects, as well as being an award/qualification granting body, the OU is - and always has been - an educational publishing house. The rise of online courses are opening up this side of educational activity to many other HEIs, too.</p>

<p>So here's a question to ponder - how might publishers of educational content/course materials leverage the sort of service Amazon's <em>CreateSpace</em> service can offer?</p>

<p>It's also worth bearing in mind that services like O'Reilly's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006669.html">SafariU</a> allow educators to compile their own POD (and ebook) textbooks from O'Reilly content, as well as mixing in their own content. (There's an interesting review of O'Reilly's methods and philsophy in a recent feature article at Information Today: <a href="http://www.infotoday.com/IT/sep07/Hawkins.shtml">O'Reilly Media: Spreading the Knowledge of Innovation</a>.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if SafariU "textbook mashups" qualify for an Amazon listing, but I'm guessing they will soon if they don't already...</p>

<h3 class="title">Daily Book Feeds</h3>

<!--
<p>I'm more and more convinced that regularly scheduled 'static' feeds are going to play an important, and effective, role in supporting informal learning. My own early experiments with daily feed have revolved around <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009164.html">OpenLearn<em>_daily</em></a>, which will be undergoing a revamp just as soon as the OpenLearn unit content feeds start working properly (more on that later...).</p>

<p>(At the moment, OpenLearn<em>_daily</em> uses <a href="http://feedcycle.co.uk/">Feedcycle</a> to deliver the feeds, although I have also posted about a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010489.html">daily feed Yahoo pipe</a> which is far less hassle to set up!)</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the web, out-of-copyright books are starting to receive the daily feed treatment too, as <a href="http://www.dailylit.com/">Daily Lit</a> shows:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108516002092158434"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUYPOIaDeI/AAAAAAAAAko/IsdGi8_yjms/s800/dailylit1.png" /></a></p>

<p>As well as feed subscriptions, you can also choose to receive daily emails (which was the original motivation for the site, I think...).</p>

<p>Whilst no registration is required to receive a Daily Lit feed, it's still possible to defined your own personal delivery schedule:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108516006387125746"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUYPeIaDfI/AAAAAAAAAkw/zaS1q_DmMiw/s800/dailylit2.png" /></a></p>

<p>If you do register, however, more advanced subscription tools are available, such as the ability to <em>suspend</em> the delivery of feed items, or manage the delivery days for feed items as well as the number of items per installment (<em>normal</em> - 1 item per day, <em>longer</em> - 2 items per day, <em>longest</em> - 4 items per day).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5108519588389850626"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RuUbf-IaDgI/AAAAAAAAAk8/XNLqejaVy4g/s800/dailylit3.png" /></a></p>

<p>[UPDATE: when you start to receive subscriptions, each daily item is delivered with a 'sponsored' link ("Buy this item from Amazon") and a list of adminsitrative links at the end of the post:<br />
    * Add next installment to feed right now<br />
    * Discuss with other readers in the forum<br />
    * Suspend this subscription<br />
    * Manage all your subscriptions<br />
<em>Add next installment to feed right now</em> is a particulary neat idea, although to actually benefit from tjhe extra item you also need to have some way of forcing your feedreader to refresh the feed immediately.]</p>

<p>Another nice feature is a "bookroll" that allows you to display a list of the books you are currently subscribed on your blog/social network profile pages. This is also the first inkling of how Daily Lit might be used to develop in the social networking direction itself...</p>

<p>It would be nice to see the Daily Lit platform develop further, even going so far as to allow (private?) subscriptions to user provided URLs.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iMHCrd9RNCw"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iMHCrd9RNCw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>I particularly like the drag'n'drop ability to reorder the set of links to be used in the show - far slicker than the "1.0" approach used in H2O playlists!</p>

<p>I deliberately avoided the 'freeplay' approach in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010531.html">feedshow</a>, which was intended as a presenter tool; but I wonder, would it be handy to add that as an option?</p>

<!--
<p>A couple of weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> team released a host of OpenLearn related RSS feeds as part of the latest release of the OpenLearn environment.</p>

<p><h2>OpenLearn  "Course Unit List By Topic" Feeds</h2></p>

<div style="height:450px;width:300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=gloss_silver&file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/openlearn.xml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/openlearn.xml"></script></div>

<p>This widget can be used as a navigation scheme for the OpenLearn units as this simple demo shows: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php?h=500&s=http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn&u=http://grazr.com/data/psychemedia/openlearn.xml">Navigating OpenLearn Units using Grazr</a>.</p>

<p>As well as topic level feeds (that is, feeds containing a list of units in each topic area), an <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1/learningspace.xml">All OpenLearn Units feed</a> is also available.</p>

<p>For convenience, I have bundled the topic feeds into a single OPML feed available from here: <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/openlearnTopicFeeds.xml">OpenLearn Courses OPML</a></p>

<p>An <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/grazrOpenLearnSearch.opml">OpenLearn search GrazrScript OPML feed</a> is also available. (Until such a time as the OU search engine support OpenSearch RSS results, this uses a Dapper application to generate the results feed by screenscraping!)</p>

<p>For completeness, here's a literally combined <a href="http://grazr.com/read/psychemedia/openlearn.xml">OpenLearn Units and OpenLearn Search GrazrScript OPML feed</a>. This is the one that is used in the above demo.</p>

<p><h2>OpenLearn Unit Content Feeds</h2><br />
Far more exciting, to my mind at least, is the release of RSS versions of each of the OpenLearn course units (this is still rolling out). </p>

<p>Here's an example: a course unit on <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/2504/formats/MA290_2_rss.xml">Babylonian mathematics (via RSS)</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the full list here: <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/index.php">OpenLearn Units and thier RSS unit content feeds</a>.</p>

<p>The feeds are also reachable from each course unit landing page (<a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2439">example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5107380009012170194"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RuEPDuIaDdI/AAAAAAAAAj4/M9PHG0DyBj0/s800/openlearnUnit.png" /></a></p>

<p><s><em>Unfortunately</em>, the feeds I tested don't appear to working in Grazr at the moment, so I can't embed a demo.</s> [UPDATE: all the OpenLearn unit content feeds now seem to be working properly :-)]</p>

<p>BUT - by making these feeds available, the potential for "<em>feedlearning with OpenLearn</em>" is significant.</p>

<p><s>There are still one or two issues around relating to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010539.html">addressing of course units and feeds</a> - at the moment you can't obtain (or even generate) a list of course content feed URLs from the unit listing feeds, but hopefully that will be addressed by the next push of the unit listing feeds (maybe by adding a numeric location/reference code element in the metadata?).</s> [UPDATE: solved; for example, here's an OPML file that points to unit content feeds for the  Science and Nature units: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnopml.php">Science and Nature Unit Content Feeds (OPML Reading List)</a>. <s>HOWEVER, the OpenLearn unit content RSS is not liked - at the moment - either by Grazr or Optimal browser... it seems to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010550.html">work okay in a browser though?</a>; I haven't tried it yet in an online feed reader...]</s></p>

<p><h3>OpenLearn XML Feeds</h3><br />
Finally, its worth mentioning that the XML 'source' files for OpenLearn Units are now available via a URL. That is, there is no longer a requirement to download the XML in a zipped file bundle.</p>

<p>With mashup services such as IBM's DAMIA accepting XML input, it will be interesting to see whether improving the availability of the raw XML in this way encourages people to play with it...</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn RSS So Nearly There...</h3>

I was just about to write a post talking up the release of RSS listings of OpenLearn courses, as well as the far, far more exciting news that RSS versions of the OpenLearn units themselves are being made available (e.g....
<!--
<p>I was just about to write a post talking up the release of RSS listings of OpenLearn courses, as well as the far, far more exciting news that RSS versions of the OpenLearn units themselves are being made available (e.g. see this list of <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/index.php">OpenLearn Units as RSS</a>), but you know what...? I'm not going to...</p>

<p>The value-add I had in mind for the post <em>was</em> intended to be a quick 10 minute script that took an RSS feed of course units, used a simple string rewrite of the URLs to convert them to URLs that pointed to the RSS feeds, and then bundled them up in an OPML file for viewing in Grazr.</p>

<p>But you know what?</p>

<p>Whilst the RSS listings of course units point - quite sensibly - to the "tidy" URL for each course (something like <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?name=A103_1">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?name=A103_1</a> for example), the unit content RSS feeds themselves (and the actual links to the course units on the HTML version of the page) use a nasty URL, such as <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1472">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1472</a> for a course unit, and <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1472/formats/A103_1_rss.xml">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/1472/formats/A103_1_rss.xml</a> for a feed.</p>

<p>The number in the URL - <em>1472</em> in the above case - is of course unique to each unit, though it is consistent across HTML and RSS locations of the same unit.</p>

<p>And it doesn't appear anywhere in the "All OpenLearn Units", or OpenLearn Units by topic, RSS feeds.</p>

<p>So I <em>can't</em> use the RSS feed(s) of course units to produce an OPML feed that points to the RSS versions of the units...</p>

<p>That is, I can't even create the URL for the RSS version of a unit from the unit's description in the course listing feed...</p>

<p>So close, folks, yet so far away...</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE: there is- apparently - a sensible URL for the RSS feeds that works; for example <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/A103_1/formats/A103_1_rss.xml">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/file.php/A103_1/formats/A103_1_rss.xml</a> </p>

<p>Which means ...  I can get a feed of content feeds. For example, here are the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearnopml.php">Science and Nature units via an OPML feed</a>. Note that at the moment, they don;lt seem to work in either Grazr or Optimal browser...]</strong></p>

<!--
<p>For some reason, I haven't been tracking the <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/">Google Custom Search Engine blog</a> which is stupid, <em>stupid, STUPID</em>, because the service now provides plenty of searchfeedr-like components as Lego blocks. I half twigged this in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010456.html">Google Custom Search on the Fly (just like searchfeedr....err?)</a> but didn't really grok the power of it until just now, whilst looking through the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html">Google CSE documentation</a>, and this post on the CSE blog - <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2007/06/custom-search-engine-apis.html">Custom Search Engine APIs</a>.</p>

<p>The post began innocuously (?!) enough: "With our new <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cref.html" title="Linked CSEs">Linked CSEs</a>, we are exposing the API to create and control CSEs."</p>

<p>Then the hints start to drop: for example, using the original CSE, "[i]t was difficult to use other data sources such as iCal, RSS, Google Base, etc. to programmatically create CSEs."</p>

<p>True...</p>

<p>So get this: "[Y]ou can now specify your CSE using a ... parameter that points to a URL, anywhere on the web.  You update this URL at your end and don't have to upload it or edit your CSE using our tools. The URL can take arguments to produce dynamic CSEs, based on the current page, the current user visiting your site, etc. ... You can use any script you want, or reference a static file, when creating your CSE."</p>

<p>Cool - so now I can define a "live" CSE using my own dynamic PHP script, say, and use it to power a custom search... that is, I could now build something like searchfeedr using a CSE...<br />
<blockquote><b>How does this work?</b> With Linked CSEs, you designate a CSE specification URL with each search request (as a hidden form field in your search box HTML code).  Google retrieves the CSE specification from the URL when your user searches in the CSE.  We cache and refresh the results so that only the first search to your CSE incurs any delay.  The flexibility to specify how your search engine should behave, just when your user is doing the query, using whatever data sources you want, opens up many possibilities.</blockquote><em>Possibilities?</em> For coders, maybe. But that said, it's still quite a niche community. Writing the link scraping and feed parsing scripts to grab the links to feed in to a dynamically created CSE definition file is not likely to appeal to many people...</p>

<p>But hang on:<br />
<blockquote>You can use our <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/tools.html" title="makecse tool">makecse tool</a> to generate CSEs from different sources of links:<br />
<ul><li>HTML:  <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/tools/makecse?url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell/ai.html" title="http://www.cs.berkeley/~russell/ai.html">http://www.cs.berkeley/~russell/ai.html</a></li><br />
<li>RSS: <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/tools/makecse?url=http://reddit.com/.rss" title="http://reddit.com/.rss">http://reddit.com/.rss</a></li><br />
<li>ATOM: <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/tools/makecse?url=http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" title="http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default">http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</a></li><br />
<li>OPML: <a title="http://medicalconnectivity.com/gems/blogroll.opml" href="http://www.google.com/cse/tools/makecse?url=http://medicalconnectivity.com/gems/blogroll.opml">http://medicalconnectivity.com/gems/blogroll.opml</a></li></ul><br />
You can combine multiple sources of links using our <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/tools.html" title="makeannotations tool">makeannotations tool</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html#externalanno" title="">&lt;Include&gt; tag</a>.  For example, its easy to create a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/samples/include.xml" title="search engine">search engine</a> from the links on the front pages of techmeme, slashdot and  digg.</p>

<p>You can write your own tools to produce <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/label_file.html" title="">&lt;Annotations /&gt; XML</a> from other data sources such as Google Calendar or iCal feeds, Google Base or any other structured source of information.</p>

<p>You can automatically generate any number of CSEs, each possibly tuned to a particular user. For example, we've created a sample that builds a CSE from a user's digg.com friend network and submissions using the <a title="Digg API" href="http://apidoc.digg.com/">Digg API</a>.  <a title="Try it out" href="http://www.google.com/cse/samples/digg.html">Try it out</a> and <a title="view the source" href="http://mwytock.komarix.org/pub/bin/diggcse.py?user=kevinrose">view the source</a>. This makes use of two simple python CGI scripts:  <br />
<ul><li><a title="diggannos.py" href="http://www.google.com/cse/samples/diggannos.py.txt">diggannos.py</a> generates &lt;Annotations&gt; from the specified user's submitted stories</li><br />
<li><a title="diggcse.py" href="http://www.google.com/cse/samples/diggcse.py.txt">diggcse.py</a> generates &lt;GoogleCustomizations&gt; from the specified user's friend network.  For each friend, it generates an &lt;Include&gt; element pointing to the appropriate diggannos.py URL </li></ul></blockquote><br />
The post closes with this: "Linked CSEs are a very big step for Google Custom Search."</p>

<p>They're not wrong...</p>

<p>If only I had a clear week or two to be able to play with this...</p>

<!--
<p>Quite some time ago, I posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006041.html">deliShow: A del.icio.us RSS Slide Show</a> which allowed you to "to run a slideshow or presentation of web pages, fed from a delicious RSS feed".</p>

<p>As anyone who has attended a OUseful.info session in the last year or so will tell you, one of the approaches I often take is to go for a <em>misguided tour</em> through a bewildering array of online locations. That said, I quite often have a set of core locations I intend to visit, usually in a particular order, throughout the session, and I tend to collect these beforehand either on delicious or on an H20 Playlist. That is, I collect the links somewhere I can feed from... :-)</p>

<p>So as preparation for some forthcoming talks, I thought I'd revamp deliShow, and here's the first revision result: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/feedshow.php?url=http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/fun"><em>feedshow</em></a></p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5106706450765974962"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/Rt6qdeIaDbI/AAAAAAAAAiM/hpULL18GY80/s800/feedshow.png" /></a></p>

<p><em>feedshow</em> is passed the URL of an RSS feed via the <em>url</em> argument of the feedshow URL:</p>

<p><em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/feedshow/feedshow.php?url=<strong>http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/fun</strong></em></p>

<p>A trivial (i.e. empty ;-) Yahoo pipe then parses the feed and passes its contents back to the page via a JSON feed.</p>

<p>To view the first page listed in the feed, click on the <em>Current</em> button. Clicking on <em>Back</em> and <em>Forward</em> take you to the previous and next items respectively. Note that going forward from the end of the feed takes you back to the start, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to go walkabout by following links form a particular page, feel free to do so - hitting the <em>Current</em> button will take you back to the fed page from which you started to ramble.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can also go walkabout via specific, 'user contributed' URL - simply enter it into the text box and hit <em>Go</em>. As before, clicking the <em>Current</em> button will bring you back onto the feed path.</p>

<p><em>feedshow</em> isn't quite as slick as <a href="http://www.fichey.com/">fichey</a> but I think it will meet my needs...</p>

<p>There are a quite a few opportunities for tightening up and polishing the app (such as a notification that a feed is being loaded, show launching bookmarklets, autodiscovery of feeds from HTML pages etc.) but they are left for a <s>day</s> night (?!) when I have a bit more time...</p>

<!--
<p>For many participants in higher education, getting a degree plays an important part in career development. At the OU, many of our students have traditionally been in full or part-time employment prior to, as well as during, their studies. Another category of learner - let's call them leisure learners - take up formal learning as a way of structuring their personal hobby time by exploring a particular subject in some depth, with a community of like minded others.</p>

<p>I'm still trying to work out what the audience is for open content courses, such as those provided by OpenLearn. As time goes on (OpenLearn is coming up to 1 year old in October), and as the user base develops, it'll be interesting to find out just what inspires people to make use of OpenLearn resources, and for what purpose.</p>

<p>Maybe we'll find out at the forthcoming <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php">Openlearn conference?</a></p>

<p>Anyway, <em>if</em> career related personal development is part of the motivation, then it maybe that a "job search networking" could contribute to the growth and sustainability of such sites. So it was interesting to see that <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9768418-7.html">Yahoo's new social job network: Kickstart</a> is being toe-dipped amongst US college students.</p>

<p>Apparently, "Yahoo Kickstart connects college students with alumni at the companies that they are interested in. "</p>

<p>Hmmm...</p>

<p>As well as learning for career development, returning to learning is often an outcome of raising aspirations. <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> has long been a site for sharing personal life goals and finding mutual support, although I don't know whether it's also used for job seeking...</p>

<p>When someone takes up adult learning, there is - I suspect - a <em>reason</em> for doing so; a rich context that motivates and drives the learner. I suspect that satisfying, or at least supporting, those wider needs is not something that can be accommodated simply by a virtual learning environment, in much the same way that just publishing course notes does not really help a novice learner to learn from them.</p>

<p>Which is where things like 43things and Kickstart might come in... providing a richer support environment within which informal learning can be pursued <em>in the context of how it might be "exploited"</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe...</p>

<p>...or maybe not...</p>

<p>As there are plenty of video demos around in this area, I put together a Splashcast show on the topic, and added to to my <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/channels/?c=GIPJ3220JF">OUseful Stories</a> channel.</p>

<p>The show is currently first up on the <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/channels/?c=GIPJ3220JF">OUseful Stories</a> channel. If the show isn't at the top of the channel, you'll be able to find it from the Channel Guide - the show's called "The Future  of Photography".</p>

<p><embed src="http://web.splashcast.net/go/so/1//c/GIPJ3220JF" /s/WSOR8784UR" wmode="Transparent" width="400" height="300" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /><table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><tr><td><a href="http://web.splashcast.net/add/?code=GIPJ3220JF" target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Add OUseful Stories to your page</font></a></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The running time is, err, quite long, but the movies are many and varied, including shorts on photo-morphing, timelapsed movies, Photoshop fakery, Google Earth embedding, phototourism, and 3D model generation. The audio on the second movie is rather jarring, but most of the other soundtracks aren't too bad...</p>

<p>To skip a segment, hover over the bottom of the Splashcast widget and a popup toolbar will appear from which you can step on to the next movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5106132467041570210"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RtygbOIaDaI/AAAAAAAAAhk/e7LRXTOEGpA/s800/splashCastToolbar.png" /></a></p>

<p>The one problem I have with Splashcast is that I can't find a way of directly linking to a show, other than by creating a channel that contains only that show, and adding the channel to a player that only plays that channel.</p>

<p>If you know how to link directly to a show, and/or how to embed a player that starts playing an arbitrary channel, or arbitrary show other than the one at the top of a channel list assigned to a particular player, please let me know...</p>

<p>PS if your holiday snaps didn't turn out quite how you wanted them to, why not check out OUr <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/t189">Digital Photography short course</a>?</p>

<h3 class="title">Online Databases - Astoria, Freebase et al.</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the reasons I try not to develop proof-of-concept apps that require databases is because many people just don't have access to an online database service. When I build a myself a <s>toy</s> "web page application", I try to write in a text editor using only HTML, CSS and Javascript,  with a dash of free and open third party web services.</p>

<p>Things are changing all the time though, with the arrival of more and more online database applications that provide, among other things, straightforward RESTful (i.e. "URL implemented") interfaces.</p>

<p>One that caught my eye playing catch-up this week was <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/OnlineService.aspx">Codename Astoria</a> from Microsoft. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2007/08/03/create-your-own-hosted-astoria-data-service.aspx">original blog announcement</a> describes it thus:<br />
<blockquote>The Astoria online service is an experimental service that aims at exploring programming models for data on the web, offered in the form of a service. Using the Astoria online service, web developers can create custom structured data stores (up to 100MB in size) on the web and access them from anywhere that they have Internet access. These data services can then be the storage or data source for mashups, or the backing store for Internet enabled applications, or be applied to any other scenario where a rich data service on the web is required, independently of where it is hosted.</blockquote></p>

<p>I've been looking for a quick'n'easy only data service for a daily feed reading app I'd like to try out, so maybe I'll give Astoria a go?</p>

<p>Also in this area in my catch-up feedpile is that <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/tutorial/index.html">Freebase</a> is starting to <a href="http://www.profy.com/2007/08/23/freebase-search/">open up it's search services to the public</a>. In case you haven't come across it yet, Freebase is a "shared, collaboratively produced database of the world's knowledge", the sort of thing that could sit behind a "live semantic encyclopedia".</p>

<p>Being able to search through - and generate views over, or reports from - uploaded (as well as user entered) data is also possible through services such as <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a> (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6wZmYMWKLkY">see a demo</a>).</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6wZmYMWKLkY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6wZmYMWKLkY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Of course, many potential database use cases require user input via HTML web forms, and there are all manner of services that will help you build a web form to get data in to a database that is set up for you by the form building application. One that I try to keep tabs on is <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/">Zoho Creator</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPWpQk54kJk">see a demo</a>). </p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PPWpQk54kJk"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PPWpQk54kJk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Zoho Creator provides you with an (online) environment for developing forms to collect information as well as application logic for processing the collected data, realising in part what I had in mind in a post from a year or so ago: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006123.html">WebApping - Web Apps Made Blog Easy</a>!</p>

<p>PS because it feels as if my posts always mention a Google app, I've deliberately refrained from mentioning <a href="http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a> in this post, the database engine built into  the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html">Google Gears</a> browser extension, or the Google Base support offered from the <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Mashup Editor</a>... Doh!</p>

<p>Putting together the previous post, I noticed that there is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/google"><em>Official GoogleChannel</em></a>, which has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhGpzyFdhE">product demos</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7s8q9nTQh4">'user' interviews</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLgJYBRzUXY">a bit of PR</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GtgSkmDnbQ">'inspirational' talks</a> and some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKAInP_tmHk">fun user-contributed stuff</a> too:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qKAInP_tmHk"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qKAInP_tmHk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>A quick scout around suggests that the OU might have just got one too: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity">http://www.youtube.com/theopenuniversity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105332915929746834"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RtnJPOIaDZI/AAAAAAAAAgg/Iqb1P6847VM/s800/ouYouTube.png" /></a></p>

<p><s>I guess Marketing have taken this one up, based on the first batch of content!</s> [UPDATE: SB writes: "What's all this about Marketing being responsible for the OU YouTube effort!!  It's the online services part of comms - Matt Rawlinson has been adding what he's allowed to. More to come soon..  Open2 are up there now too." I stand corrected...]</p>

<p>(Once the domain of the IT folks, I think that 'web stuff' is now increasingly owned by comms and marketing folks...)</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see what goes up there over the coming weeks and months. Ads and commercials, no doubt, although not quite the sort you might expect, as this quickie describing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01gX49ERzOE">some of the OU's boradcast TV output</a> suggests...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/01gX49ERzOE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/01gX49ERzOE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>So here are a few things I think we could start to pop up alongside the ads - note that this means using the channel as <em>more</em> than just a student recruitment channel... :</p>

<ul><li><em>software demos</em> - the OU is, among other things, an educational software house (though not as much as we used to be, I think...?) and the occasional walkthrough of some of our software tools would be both attractive to potential students, and possibly informative to the elearning community at large... (Software development is managed alongside other materials production by <em>Media Project Managers</em>, one of which is being <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3220&ref=ouseful">advertised at the moment</a>.) As well as educational software, we also develop research related software too, of course...</li>
<li><em>course adverts</em> - 2 minute trailers, with glimpses of the best bits, just like in movie trailers ;-)</li>
<li><em>talks and seminars</em> - from both internal and external speakers. I watch quite a few <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplex.html">Google Tech Talks</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theatre</a> presentations, so going for a wider audience for the <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">Berrill Stadium seminars</a> may be sensible?</li>
<li><em>student voices</em> - I seem to remember a <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/widening-participation/p2.shtml">Widening Participation DVD</a> being produced that could seed some of these clips?</li>
<li><em>clips of OU broadcast programming</em> - I notice that the BBC have a few OU clips on their YouTube site, but they aren't embeddable. It would be good if we could have them on the OU YouTube site though, and embeddable on <em>open.ac.uk</em> and <em>opent2.net</em> domains...</li></ul>

<p>Just by the by, there's a post up in the Open Broadcast Unit at the moment (the unit that manages OUr relationship with the BBC, among others...): <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3230&ref=ouseful"> Manager (Broadcast Project Impact), Open Broadcasting Unit (OBU)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>OBU is central to delivering the objectives of the OU partnership with the BBC. You'll be responsible for those aspects of the relationship with the BBC that relate to performance monitoring. This includes setting targets for, monitoring and reporting on the impact of TV and radio broadcasts, print support and online components.</p>

<p>You will work with OBU and BBC colleagues on particular projects and with a wider range of people in both organisations on strategy development and implementation. Excellent negotiating and communication skills are essential along with the ability to use your initiative to anticipate problems and provide solutions. You will have excellent IT skills and a good understanding of IT developments in the broadcast media, such as i-tunes, YouTube and web analytics. You will need an awareness of current broadcasting developments and factual programming both on TV and radio, and an interest in the aims of the partnership between the OU and the BBC.</blockquote></p>

<p>As ever, if you go for the post and get it, drop me a line when you arrive... ;-)</p>

<p>PS here's another, sort of related, catch-up item that really caught my eye: <a href="http://www.mcps-prs-alliance.co.uk/about_us/press/latestpressreleases/mcpsprsalliance/Pages/MCPS-PRSAllianceYouTubesignground-breakingagreement.aspx">Google's deal with the MCPS-PRS royalty collectors to license background music on YouTube movies</a>...</p>

<!--
<p>I've come back from holidays to find a wealth of new things to play with, so here's the first of what maybe several bitty catch-up posts...</p>

<p>First up, Google look like they might have finally "spoiled" a whole load of third party utility mashup apps by making it trivial to embed a Google map in your own web page:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105315169124879698"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/Rtm5GOIaDVI/AAAAAAAAAfM/ATeUW9SAqgE/s800/gMapEmbed.png" /></a></p>

<p>The map is embedded in an HTML <em>iframe</em>, as this example - a map of the OU campus in Milton Keynes - shows (which is why <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&amp;ll=52.026383,-0.706193&amp;spn=0.007169,0.021243&amp;t=k&amp;z=16&amp;om=1">this example</a> probably won't work in a feed reader!):</p>

<p><iframe marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&amp;ll=52.024422,-0.709459&amp;spn=0.003867,0.004623&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJqjqSXU3MsO0xKlnu8KEb15XkPHgw" frameborder="no" height="350" scrolling="no" width="425"></iframe><br />
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109196350919255002936.0004350fbe9e51aa9141a&amp;ll=52.024422,-0.709459&amp;spn=0.003867,0.004623&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;source=embed" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-align: left; font-size: small;">View Larger Map</a></p>

<p>Embedding maps has been a bit of a pain until now, but this new facility could see a whole load more appearing...</p>

<p>Second up, and just in passing, <a href="http://earth.google.com/sky/index.html">Google Earth now does the sky too</a>, allowing you to see the heavens from your current location on (Google) Earth.</p>

<p><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eMhGpzyFdhE"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eMhGpzyFdhE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></object></p>

<p>I haven't had time to play with this in any great depth yet, so it'll be interesting to see how it compares to things like Celestia and NASA's World Wind, that I've <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010504.html">posted about previously</a>.</p>

<p>However, I have to agree with <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=520">Ed Parson's</a> that possibly even more interesting in the latest Google Earth release is support for <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/photos.html">photo overlays and <em>very</em> large images</a> (see als <a href="http://www.ogleearth.com/2007/08/gigapanorg_puts.html">here</a>). The overlaid photos can be oriented relative to the 'ground', which makes it easy to pop up your own billboard!</p>

<p>So for example, here's a view of Adobe Systems, showing a vertically oriented photo, as well as Sketchup model:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105323028915031394"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RtnAPuIaDWI/AAAAAAAAAfc/JvJ7aPFhLi8/s800/gEarthPhotoOverlay.png" /></a></p>

<p>The photo is taken at very high resolution, which means it's possible to go exploring 'inside' it:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105323041799933298"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RtnAQeIaDXI/AAAAAAAAAfk/5ESyltMuoJk/s800/gEarthMegaPhoto.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here's looking into someone's window, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5105323054684835202"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RtnAROIaDYI/AAAAAAAAAfs/MyjdeEq2KY4/s800/gEarthWindow.png" /></a></p>

<p>UPDATE: here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjwr7lUruvw">video demo</a>:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kjwr7lUruvw"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kjwr7lUruvw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>This very much reminded me (although in a <em>complementary</em> way), of Microsoft's <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSynth</a>, which makes a 3D mosaic of photographs that overlap in the visual scene:</p>

<p><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p16frKJLVi0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></object></p>

<p>I wonder how long it will be before Google snap up <a href="http://fotowoosh.com/">fotowoosh</a>?</p>
