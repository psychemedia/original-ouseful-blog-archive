<h3 class="title">Deep Linking 2.0 - What Counts as Fair Use of Online Book Extracts?</h3>

<p>When I first started writing online educational materials, I was told that deep linking was out - if we wanted to reference a page several clicks down into a site, we had to provide instructions on how to find that page from the front page, which was (supposedly) the only place we could link to.</p>

<p>Times are a little more enlightened now, but still there are bottlenecks in place, and for good financial (and fair use) reasons.</p>

<p>Just now, I tried a search on Amazon - in the books section - on <em>hype cycle</em> - no hits:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5090375252289594130"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RqSlUm4pIxI/AAAAAAAAAKA/9NHdzA6eAo0/s800/amazonHypeCycle1.png" /></a></p>

<p>there was the option to search inside books though, which was far more promising:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5090375273764430626"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RqSlV24pIyI/AAAAAAAAAKI/GGE2PjzMPWA/s800/amazonHypeCycle2.png" /></a></p>

<p>From these results, I can click through to the actual page on which the search term appears:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5090377245154419522"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RqSnIm4pI0I/AAAAAAAAAKo/gH5lDNFjhc0/s800/amazonHypeCycle4.png" /></a></p>

<p>(The panel in the top left is the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OU Library Traveller panel</a>, which appears on pages that have ISBNs in the URL from a selection of bookselling and bookrelated websites. The panel looks up books with that ISBN (and alternative editions via xISBN) in the OU Library, both hard copy and ebook versions, and displays its availability. The script is easily customisable to many other library systems.)</p>

<p>As a heavy Amazon user, this ability to search through books and pull out content (as well as maybe buying the book) is a Good Thing. (Funnily enough, I don't tend to use <a href="http://books.google.com">Google books</a> to do this much...)</p>

<p>But what struck me just now was that this supports <em>exactly</em> the way I use a great many academic/technical books - to look up <em>particular</em> items on maybe one or two pages.</p>

<p>The next thought was: can I link to an open book page on Amazon and share that link? Answer: I don't think I can (though maybe I could on Google books) - I think I need to be logged in on my Amazon account?</p>

<p>The next thought: if I <em>could</em> deep link to an open book page, could I put that link in my course materials? That is, would the deep link be a fair use of the resource being linked to? The corollary I'd like to imagine in the real world is a 2 page photocopied handout for the students on a course.</p>

<p>Next thought: OU courses are password/paywall (i.e. student registration required) protected - so the use is limited (and hopefully justified under educational terms). Bit what about putting such a link in OpenLearn, where there is no restriction on access? Still fair?</p>

<p>Back behind the paywall, and could we "borrow" the Amazon embed code to display the two pages of text in the body of OUr materials, as we could with material posted on <a href="http://scribd.com">Scribd</a> for example?</p>

<p>And so it goes on...</p>

<p>The main question is - can I fairly, in password protected online educational materials, link to (or even better, embed) one/two page snippets of online scanned book content? Because often one or two pages is all I need?</p>

<p>Or would we have to license the content and pay a special page charge for it? (Obviously, we'd have to pay for larger chunks, for example at chapter level: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/fyi/blog/2007/06/buy_by_the_chapter.html">Buy By the Chapter</a>).</p>

<p>PS here's something else to chase, maybe? The <a href="http://www.openlibrary.org/toc.html">Open Library</a> (which is <em>not</em> the OU Library...):<br />
<blockquote>The Open Library website was created by the Internet Archive to demonstrate a way that books can be represented online.</p>

<p>The vision is to create free web access to important book collections from around the world.</p>

<p>Books are scanned and then offered in an easy-to-use interface for free reading online. If they're in the public domain, the books can be downloaded, shared and printed for free. They can also be printed for a nominal fee by a third party, who will bind and mail the book to you. The books are always FREE to read at the Open Library website.</blockquote></p>

<h3 class="title">Library Thing for Libraries. Oh, yes...</h3>

<p>The Open University is unlike almost every other academic library, in the same way that the OU campus is unlike most university campuses, in that it doesn't really physically cater to students, most of whom are distance learners.</p>

<p>Lending rights are largely restricted to academic members of staff, both at the OU 'central office' in Milton Keynes, as well as from the regions; and Associate Lecturers, who can make postal loans of books held in the library.</p>

<p>Local residents and students are also allowed access, I believe, but for most students, loans from the library are limited to electronic ones (and the OU has the potential to excel - meeting electronically the information needs of over 200, 000 students).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OUseful  Library Traveller</a> script uses the wide selection of online resources (ebooks and journals) to augment bookseller websites (such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble) with a panel than links directly through to an ebook version of the currently viewed book, where available. (Mail me if you want the latest version of the Firefox extension that delivers this service.)</p>

<p>Access to the OU Library OPAC (that is, the collection catalogue) is of little use to the majority of our students, although it is available to them; more useful are links to our students <em>local</em> academic library catalogues, a feature that's on my to do list for the Library Traveller.</p>

<p>Arguably, we could - maybe should - offer a <em>single</em> user-customisable library catalogue interface that presents a view on to the student's local academic library catalogue. Think something like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006140.html">Talis Silkworm Directory service</a> feeding an 'OU student local library catalogue' interface. </p>

<p>Alternatively, we could take a step back, and ask what it is we want from an academic book catalogue.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell (<em>not</em> being a librarian ;-), the OPAC does two main things, as far as the user is concerned.</p>

<p>Firstly, it's a custom search engine, socially constructed in part, over book and journal resources held by the library, with resources identified by academic staff and subject librarians over the past forty years.</p>

<p>Secondly, it tells me about the availability of a particular book held in the collection, within the OU library, or the availability of the publication online.</p>

<p>In minor third place, the system tells me about the current status of my loans - books I have out on loan, books I have reserved, books I'm overdue in returning.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, what services would I like the catalogue to offer me <em>as a student</em> (assuming for the moment we are limiting this to books (err, why??????;-)):</p>

<p>- effective search that works for mortals - i.e. not just based on some formal classiifcation by a cataloguer professional...;<br />
- books that are 'good hits' given my search terms/personal needs;<br />
- reading and recommendation lists for a particular course, perhaps?<br />
- availability of said books in a library <em>local to me</em>;<br />
- availability of books I have full electronic access to  - or that I can browse (e.g. via Google Books or Amazon Search Inside);<br />
- how appropriate the book is for a particular course, maybe? Think: Amazon-like reviews by other students, or course team members;<br />
- related books - 'students who studied this book on this course also studied...';<br />
- other editions of this book. Think: xISBN, or similar.<br />
- a place for me to add my own review of a book, maybe?<br />
- negotiated discounts with vendors should I want to buy several books on a list;<br />
- and maybe even <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009232.html">search over OU and OpenLearn materials</a>?</p>

<p>(Hmmm - it's quite interesting comparing that list with this one from a long time ago idling about My(Open)Library: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005306.html">OurLibrary</a>.)</p>

<p>How many of these services do we currently offer to our students, I wonder? (answers from the Library website redesign team  - who did an audit on the old/current site - in a comment to this post, please ;-)</p>

<p>Step in, <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">Library Thing</a>. For those of you who don't know about Library Thing, err, you should... ;-)  It's a bit like your own personal library catalogue, a bit like delicious for books.</p>

<p>It offers user tagging, reviews and related books; personal bookshelves/collections; and social "book club" like discussion groups.</p>

<p>And now, it's for libraries too: <a href="http://www.librarything.com/forlibraries/">Library Thing for Libraries</a>. Like <a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2007/05/danbury-ct-kicks-off-librarything-for.php">for the libraries in Danbury, Connecticut</a>, for example.</p>

<p>So what does it offer? basically, an augmentation of the default library catalogue view with the following Library Thing sourced data:<br />
<blockquote># Book recommendations. Show high-quality "recommended" or "similar" books.<br />
# Tag browsing. Give your patrons the power and flexibility of searching and browsing your books by tags.<br />
# User reviews and ratings. Add hundreds of thousands of high-quality user reviews. Give your patrons the ability to add their own.<br />
# FREE: Other editions and translations. Link related editions and translations of the same work.</blockquote></p>

<p>Okay, okay - so <em>at the moment</em> Library Thing is fiction focussed and not necessarily tuned to academic textbook collections.</p>

<p>But suspend your disbelief for a moment and suppose - just suppose - we give OUr students a <em>Library Thing, Academic</em> account? (is such a thing as <em>Library Thing, Academic</em>, likely, Tim?)</p>

<p>And suppose further we integrate this with a customisable OU student/UK academic library catalogue interface built on top of something like Silkworm, so students can see when a relevant book is held close to them (or via the OU Library, in electronic form)...?</p>

<p>... as well as supporting electronic resource collections built around <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003940.html">DOI</a>s (that is, cataloguing DOIs, as well as ISBNs) with one-click, pre-authenticated access to online electronic subscription copies.</p>

<p>Our students are distributed in nature - a problem for localised thinking in terms of the provision of library catalogue services, but one that is turned into an asset by approaches such as Library Thing...or <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/">Bookcrossing.com</a>.</p>

<p>We're already developing one informally titled service in the OU: <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/?p=168"><em>MyStuff</em></a> - the e-portfolio.</p>

<p>So how about another: <em>Library Things</em>?</p>

<h3 class="title">CFP: First International M-Libraries Conference, 13-14 November, 2007</h3>

<p>I'm not sure <em>how</em> the <em> First International M-Libraries Conference</em> (no link? ah - here maybe: <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/index.cfm?wpid=7150">IMLC-07</a>(?!;-)) is being advertised, although the first I heard of it officially was via an internal email today with a plea: "The Open University Library is arranging an M-Libraries conference in November and we are looking for papers to include. So far we haven't received any submissions from Open University staff outside the library. " </p>

<p>Hmmm - this call must only have reached those parts of the blogosphere I don't inhabit... (but then, I don't tend to track the mobile stuff...)</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the call if - like with me - it missed your radar...</p>

<h3 class="title">OpenLearn/OCW Reading Lists</h3>

<p>I was just having a quick look at the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseware</a> site to see how they structured their content (it is, of course, just enough different on each page to make screen scraping a chore...) and many of the courses listed there have a reading list associated with the course.</p>

<p>For example, here's the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Political-Science/17-181Spring-2006/Readings/">reading list for a course on sustainable development</a>. In this case, the reading list is split into a section detailing recomended books, and then additional readings (categorised as <em>required reading</em>, <em>related reading</em> or <em>essential reading</em>) for each of the weekly study topics.</p>

<p>In the same way that I think there is a lot useful something (information, definitely, but also maybe: knowledge? structure? relevance? focus?) tied up in the set of external links that are included in online teaching materials (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</a> for example) I think the same is probably true of traditional reading lists.</p>

<p>So methinks it would be really handy if the lists were made available in a machine readable way that supported syndication.</p>

<p>To make things easy, something like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/richpub/listmania/createpipeline/">Amazon Listmania! lists</a> looks like it could provide a pre-established way of: a) storing lists of ISBNs; b) linking directly to book info/book covers etc; and c) offering the possibility of revenue generation (by associating the list with an AMazon affiliate ID somehow, so if someone buys a book via your list, you get a cut...)</p>

<p>To get things gloing in the 'how does it actually feel when you try it' game, I produced a list based on the Recommended Reading list for the aforementioned MIT OCW course. Here it is: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R2RMY1YZQ91481/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view/202-1166911-6337439"><em> MIT OCW: 17.181/2 Sustainable Development (rec. reading)</em> Listmania List</a>.</p>

<p>Using a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">third party service</a> that leverages Amazon ECS webservices, here's a link to an RSS version of the list: <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/amazonbox.aspx?id=R2RMY1YZQ91481&type=Listmania&locale=uk&feed=rss&page=1&items=20&imgtype=small&sorttype=DateAdded&associd=ouseful-21"><em>MIT OCW: 17.181/2 Sustainable Development (rec. reading)</em> Listmania List [RSS]</a>. This feed actually includes my Amazon affiliate ID.</p>

<p>The feed can of course now be displayed in a wide variety of ways, from <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=12pt&view=3p&file=http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/amazonbox.aspx?id=R2RMY1YZQ91481&type=Listmania&locale=uk&feed=rss&page=1&items=20&imgtype=small&sorttype=DateAdded&associd=ouseful-21">Grazr widgets</a> to webtops, blogs and maybe even VLEs ;-)</p>

<p>Issues? One of the ISBNs in the reading list wasn't recognised. Whilst it was easy enough to set up the Listmania! list and add the ISBNs to it, it wasn't obvious what comment to apply to each book.</p>

<p>More significant questions are sure to arise when it comes to actually putting the weekly readings into a list. For example, how to a) identify the topic (maybe the list name?); and b) specify sections/pages to be read (use the comment field, I guess?).</p>

<p>Listmania lists only work for ISBNs, so referencing academic articles etc. is more problematic.</p>

<p>Maybe a more useful tool - in academic circles at least - would be to use something like <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>?</p>

<p>That said, using a Listmania! list may have some useful side effects.</p>

<p>Firstly, it sets up an association between titles that Amazon may draw on as part of its book recommendation algorithm.</p>

<p>Secondly, people shopping on Amazon may have your list pulled up as they search. In terms of supporting informal learning, this may be quite handy (even more so if there were a way of associating the Listmania! list with a URL, such as that of an Open Content course associated with the list?)</p>

<p>A more extreme approach could even see the reading list being used to seed an <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon aStore</a>, like my own first crude attempt: <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/robofestauk-21">Geek Lit</a> ;-)</p>

<p>This represents a more heavyweight approach to generating revenue via an open content course/free informal learning course, of course (3x ?!), but how else are such initiatives to become financially sustainable? (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006142.html">Ads, maybe?</a>).</p>

<p>PS It turns out that you can actually use a Listmania! list to seed an aStore, so it took less than 10 mins to use the above OCW/Sustainable Development list to seed this <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/ocwdemo-21">Sustainable Development</a> aStore (yes, I know I probably shouldn't have used the MIT/OCW logo...)</p>

<p>The aStores also support subpages, so if a Listmania! list for each weekly topic of the OCW course was provided, these could be trivially used to pipe content into weekly book requirement pages within the aStore. (Using Listmania! lists to store the books for each topic is better than entering the books explicitly into an aStore page, because it makes syndication so much easier).</p>

<p>With the addition of something like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009009.html">OU Library Traveller</a> greasemonkey script, looking up a book on the aStore wil also return physical and/or ebook holdings info for that book from the OU library.</p>

<h3 class="title">ISBN 13 to 10</h3>

<p>Doodling with the Library Traveller script, I found that Blackwells use an ISBN 13 code in their book details page URLs, which the Amazon web service I use to look up book info (title, author etc.) doesn't much like: it wants ISBN 10.</p>

<p>Here's a first attempt at a javascript function to convert from ISBN13 to 10. Note I can't guarantee it's correct (though it seemed to work with a couple of test ISBNs I just tried).</p>

<pre>function isbn13to10(isbn13)
 {
   var isbn9 = isbn13.substring(3,12);
   var n=0; var c=0;
   for (i=1;i<10;i++) {
     c = isbn9.substr(i,1) * 1;
     if ((c>0)&&(c<9)) n += (11-i)*c;
   }
   n = 11 - n%11;
   if (n==11) isbn10=isbn9+'0';
   else if (n==10) isbn10=isbn9+'X';
   else isbn10=isbn9+n;
   //alert(isbn10);
   return isbn10;
 }</pre>
 
If you spot any flaws (quite likely, I was trying to translate a couple of functions from other languages and it's toooooo late... :-( please post a comment with a fix ;-)

<p>Three days away blogging doing other things (helping scope a robotics show for <a href="http://www.techniquest.org/">Techniquest</a> in Cardiff for one thing) and it so feels like a chore coming back to it... so here's just a quick diary post to log recent OU Traveller progress before functionality gets locked down and styling spruced up ready for an official release by the Library :-)</p>

<p>Ok - so what's new? Looking back over the blog, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008658.html">last update</a> described a title and author lookup. Following discussions with the Library, the functionality has been tightened up somewhat and a greater focus placed on delivering OU Library services, with the result that things like a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006280.html">Google Books lookup</a> are unlikely to appear in the official release.</p>

<p>(Just by the by, <a href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=&scope=books">Microsoft Live Booksearch</a> also fired up today... )</p>

<p>Wherever possible, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006569.html">libezproxifying</a> of links to ebook resources has also been built in, which means single click-thru from the OU Traveller panel to books on O'Reilly Safari for example, as well as other e-holdings.</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerGreedy.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerGreedy.jpg" width="663" height="153" border="0" /></p>

<p>To produce the above screenshot, a two step lookup of the library catalogue is actually being carried out. For the particular book in question, an ISBN lookup on the catalogue returns a results page with two options - a link to the full results page for a physical copy of the book, and a link to the results page for an ebook holding. Being greedy, the script identifies the ebook link and a second background call to the library catalogue is made using this link. The ebook item results page that is consequently returned is then scoured for the link to the actual ebook resource, and it is this link that is the one that is presented in the Traveller panel.</p>

<p>The link text also disguises where the book is actually held. The same link text (<em>Available online (courtesy of The Open University Library)</em>) is also used for books held by O'Reilly Safari for example (which the OU Library also has a subscription to). What is interesting is that Safari ebook hits are not returned by the Voyager catalogue (maybe I should write a script to extend the library catalogue pages to report holdings users do have access to even if Voyager doesn't know about them? ;-)</p>

<p>I realised today that it's also possible to use an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pingBack.php?output=json">IP address</a> lookup to identify whether a user is browsing from the OU network. In fact, it's actually possible to tell from the IP address whether or not the request has been made from within the <a href="http://www.shca.com/portfolio/default.asp?sctId=361&projType=Architecture">OU Library building</a> itself. Although I've not added the functionality yet, it would seem sensible to report back the actual shelf location of items held in the library via the Traveller panel for users who happen to be visiting Amazon from within the library. Or maybe not?</p>

<p>You may notice in the screenshot the link suggesting the user can propose the OU Library purchases the title in question. This links through to a 'book suggest' form which is <em>also</em> extended via the OU Traveller extension (here's an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007194.html">earlier example</a> of the same approach). In particular, book author and title information, as well as publication date, are automatically pasted into the page. The <em>No luck?</em> link appears whether or not the book is held (in any form) by the Library, partly because it makes the coding easier, partly to promote this service. At the moment, the suggestion form is geared towards the acquisition of physical books, but it would also be handy to be able to request the purchase of electronic resources too.</p>

<p>Through developing the script, I'm starting to realise how the OU Library will be increasingly able to support OU students in a traditional way. Unlike most universities, the OU campus is largely 'student-free' - not surprising, given we are a distance education institution. What this has meant to date is that book lending services focus on book provision to academics and central staff, as well as <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/loans/regstaff.html">loans to OU staff in the regions</a>.</p>

<p>Increasingly, however, the OU Library is able to fulfill information requests using eResources, so it may be that soon we will be able to offer  students a comprehensive OU Library ebook catalogue (I almost said OPAC  - but they're all <em>horrible</em> to use, aren't they? ;-) that they can use to borrow books from instantaneously.</p>

<p>Another thing I'd like to see arising from the current library website redesign project is the provision of local (physical) library catalogue search services to our students.</p>

<p>OU students often have lending rights at their <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/search/clickable_map.php">local academic library</a> but we don't provide a single uniform location in the OU library site from which to search these catalogues (how about  <em>library.open.ac.uk/local</em> for example, customised via a cookie or library login ID, and offering the same search box to everyone that leads to the students local library catalogue?).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/platform/">Talis Platform</a> project is one tool we could start using, but as with using all 'free' third party services/APIs: how do we know that a) the data will be kept up to date?; and b) how do we know the service will hang around for the next few years?</p>

<p>Taking a baby steps approach, what I'd quite like to see is a script that will add links identified via Talis Platform to results pages like <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/search/report.php?Region=04">this one</a> that in turm lead directly to the corresponding catalogue; or, even better, buttons that will let the user search the corresponding catalogue from a single search box at the top of the page...</p>

<p>I don't have time to pursue this at the moment, but if someone else did, I could start to use it to demo Talis Platform functionality to the library website redesign team..............</p>

<h3 class="title">DigiLab now open in the OU Library...</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/">Digilab</a>  - a playspace for new technologies  - opened in the Library a couple of days ago:</p>

<blockquote>DigiLab is a showcase for tools, technologies and resources illustrating how today's technology can nurture tomorrow's learners. The long term aim will be to provide visitors with guides explaining how engaging interactive materials achieve successful learning outcomes. It is hoped that exploration of DigiLab will spark the creativity of the multi-disciplinary teams who develop our learning materials</blockquote>

<p>As well as the room itself, DigiLab is also sponsoring the <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/services/loanout.php">loan of Gameboys, PSPs, iPods etc etc</a> from the library loans desk. (In fact, borrowing some of these items has been possible for a year or so now - I remember taking an OU Library iPod away for Christmas, and a PSP out a few weeks later.)</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007UATDG?ie=UTF8&tag=robofestauk-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0007UATDG">Nintendo Wii Console</a> is apparently on order... I think it'd be good if they got a Nabaztag WiFi Rabbit too: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FDEC0G?ie=UTF8&tag=robofestauk-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B000FDEC0G"><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000FDEC0G.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_V34649888_.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=robofestauk-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000FDEC0G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>DigiLab bookmarks are being collected on a delicious account with username <a href="http://del.icio.us/digilab">digilab</a>; there's also a DigiLabrarian avatar in Second Life - <em>Kayla Vielle</em> - and a Second Life avatar DigiLab patrons can 'borrow' - <em>Digi May</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, now the room is open to all, I've started wondering about what sorts of thing it would be good to do in there, and how we might be able to use the room to get an <em>ad hoc</em> viral buzz going about different technologies.</p>

<p>Here's one possible format, inspired by an excellent link that I was sent a day or two ago (from someone who doesn't blog yet (...)) to a video that demonstrates the use of a beautiful tool for animating UN socio-economic data (?):</p>

<p><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=2670820702819322251#3m24s&hl=en-GB" flashvars=""> </embed></p>

<p>(If your feedreader can't cope with embedded Google Video, check here: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2670820702819322251#3m24s">Ideas Worth Spreading: Hans Rosling from TED 2006</a>.)</p>

<p>When I saw this movie, I thought it was just the sort of thing to summon the troops around and watch over a coffee, followed by a bit of a play: <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder">http://tools.google.com/gapminder</a> (interesting URL, I thought...?). You can also find more info at <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly the lack of a coffee machine in the DigiLab makes coffee a little tricky right now, but apparently it's on the cards :-)</p>

<p>PS At the DigiLab launch, PVC (Learning and Teaching) let it be known that he was getting a fund together to support something along the lines of beta.open.ac.uk (or labs.open.ac.uk) which could be used to try out experimental presentation models. If I get more concrete details, I'll post them either here or on my little used Nous internal blog. If any internal readers have more info about this, please add a comment... If anyone is interested in making a pitch using tools or techniques mentioned in the OUseful blog, mail me...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Traveller - Title Lookup</h3>

<p>A couple of people have got in touch recently about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=traveller&IncludeBlogs=1149">OU Library Traveller Scripts</a> that pop up library info panels on Amazon et al. book pages (I'll mail you soon - I promise...;-) and it prompted me to dust off a script I started to doodle with a bit ago to deal with the multiple ISBN problem...</p>

<p>...you know the one - where the book you're looking at on Amazon is held by the library, but in a different format or edition, and hence under a different ISBN, which is used to key the script.</p>

<p>Jon Udell posted a Greasemonkey script that will <A href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/01/30.html">search the catalogue using xISBNs</a> - that is, equivalent ISBN numbers for a particular book identified via OCLC's <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/xisbn/">xISBN</a> service (he could also have used the <a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/2006/06/thingisbn-librarythings-first-api.php">LibraryThing ThingISBN service</a>).</p>

<p>But that's all a bit too much like hard work for lazy old me... </p>

<p>Now, AI is (or used to be) my background, and in AI we use all sorts of heuristics (rules of thumb) and shortcuts for getting things to work, and sometimes they even work to a "good enough" QoS level;-) I haven't started on an AI solution yet (! - and don't intend to...;-), but here's a crude heuristic - <em>if the library holds the book under a different ISBN, maybe it'll find it if I search by title?</em></p>

<p>The OU Traveller scripts are intended to work on sites wherever there is an ISBN in the URL, so scraping the title off an arbitrary site is hard. That's not a problem, though, because we can use an Amazon web service to look up the title of a book from its ISBN, which is what the new script does.</p>

<p>If a book can't be found in your library catalogue using the ISBN, the script then offers to do a title (or author) search. (The next time I revisit this script I will build the title lookup to run automatically and report holding status back via the Traveller panel):</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerTitle1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerTitle1.jpg" width="663" height="283" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the appropriate link then runs the relevant search on the library catalogue:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerTtile2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerTtile2.jpg" width="502" height="180" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to give the script a run on your own catalogue, the ISBN lookup will worth with very minor modifications (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008008.html">Generic Library Traveller</a> for more info) but you will need to dig around in the script  - and play with URLs from your own library catalogue - to work out the title or author lookup. Mail me if you do this and we can collect customisations on a wiki somewhere.</p>

<p>Maybe, if there is enough (any?!) interest, I'll look at ways of making the title lookup generic for different vendor catalogues on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Anyway - enough of that: the script is here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/genericTravellerAlphaTitleLookup.user.js">Generic Library Traveller with OU Book Title lookup</a>.</p>

<p>There are potential conflicts with previous installations/versions of the Library Traveller scripts, so you may have to pay a visit to the Greasemonkey control panel in your browser to disable previous versions.</p>

<p>If you are trusting of compiled Greasemonkey scripts (that is, Firefox extensions generated from Greasemonkey scripts), and/or would rather not install Greasemonkey, feel free to create your own extension from the script (e.g. using the <a href="http://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler">Arantius Greasemonkey compiler</a>).</p>

<p>I do not accept any liability whatsoever if anything goes wrong, of course ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Generic Library Traveller</h3>

<p>Just dusted off some of the Library Traveller code (the Greasemonkey script that adds a floating panel over a page when there's something that looks like an ISBN in the URL, and provides links to your local library, a citation generator, Google books etc. for that book) and tried to make it a little more generic.</p>

<p>The script is still tied to a particular library catalogue, but I've tried to make it easier to customise by "borrowing" some code from Jon Udell's <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookupGenerator.html">Library Lookup bookmarklet generator</a>.</p>

<p>All the user has to do to customise the script is provide three pieces of information:</p>

<p>- the web domain for their library catalogue,;<br />
- the library's name (actually, this could be dropped too);<br />
- the type of library catalogue system that is running.</p>

<p>For example, here is the configuration information for the Open University Library Catalogue:<br />
<blockquote>// ONE     Your library name here<br />
var libraryName='The Open University Library';  <br />
// TWO     Your library catalogue web domain here<br />
var libCatRoot = 'http://voyager.open.ac.uk';<br />
// THREE   Your library catalogue type<br />
var libCatType='voyager';/</blockquote></p>

<p>and here is the configuration information for the Keene Public Library:<br />
<blockquote>// ONE     Your library name here<br />
var libraryName='Keene Public Library'; <br />
// TWO     Your library catalogue web domain here<br />
var libCatRoot = 'http://ksclib.keene.edu'; <br />
// THREE   Your library catalogue type<br />
var libCatType='innovative';</blockquote></p>

<p>The script will only tell you if the book is held (i.e. on the records of) the library - at the moment all other library reporting (availability, when the book is due back if it's out on loan etc.) has been removed.</p>

<p>This is because: a) I want the script to be as generic as possible; and b) I want the user to have <em>as little to do as possible</em> when configuring the script.</p>

<p>The 'book is held' information uses the heuristic that, if the catalogue page that is returned from an ISBN lookup contains the first 20 characters of the title of that book, it's held by the library.</p>

<p><img alt="genericLookup.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/genericLookup.jpg" width="675" height="343" border="0" /></p>

<p>You can get hold of the script here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/genericTravellerAlpha.user.js">Generic Library  Traveller script</a>.</p>

<p>Comments, issues, successes, failures getting the script to work etc. much appreciated...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Homepage Heatmap</h3>

<p>I can't resist blogging this - a heat map of the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk">OU Library homepage</a>: <a onclick="window.open('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libHeatMap.html','popup','width=871,height=799,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libHeatMap.html">View image</a></p>

<p>The data was collected using a trial version of <a href="http://clickdensity.com/">Clickdensity heatmaps</a> over a 24 hour period a couple of days ago. The trial limits the amount of data that can be collected, so I'm not sure that map actualluy maps hits over that full period of time.</p>

<p>The OU Library site is currently undergoing a redesign, with a target roll out sometime in Q2 of next year (2007) of the new site. Apparently it's being wireframed at the moment, so it will be interesting to see how much cleaner the new design will be, especailly if it's "on brand"! (By the by, OU internal readers who aren't up to speed with brand guidelines and templates can check them out <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/brand">here</a>).</p>

<p>It's been hinted to me that the search box will be far more prominent, but I'm not sure how many other navigational devices will be on the front page.</p>

<p>One of the design considerations is to reduce the number of pages on the site, which apparently currently number in the thousands(?!), a figure that Library's adoption of Macromedia Contribute may be partly responsible for...</p>

<p>Although monthly traffic figures number in hundreds of thousands of impressions every month (a statistic I am starting to be wary of having started collecting - and inspecting - <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> data for the OUseful blog) and the heat map is of a few thousand imnpressions over a very short period, I think it's interesting to see how few of the dozens and dozens of links on the current Library homepage actually seem to be followed.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Library search box is heavily hit - even if the link you want is on the homepage, I guess that users often can't locate it!</p>

<p>Until the heatmap data started to be collected, I believe that design decisions were being made on the basis of analysis of the raw site statistics (which I don't think were actually that rich - certainly not as rich as Google analytics). I'd be interested to know just how much the graphical heat map hits home how users actually use the library front page, compared to the raw numerical data view, and whether the heat map view has changed the way in which the fron page redesign is being handled...<br/>

<h3 class="title">Mashing the Library Mashup Compeition? Compleat Grazr on Google ig</h3>

<p>The results of Talis' Mashing up the Library Cmpetition have just been <a href="http://www.talis.com/news/press/Competition2006.shtml">released</a> with John Blyberg's <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2006/08/18/go-go-google-gadget/">Go-go Google Gadgets</a> taking first place, and the collaborative <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/node/1506">Second lIfe Library 2.0 taking second</a>.</p>

<p>Blyberg's gadgets put Library services onto a Google personal page, which is a great <br />
way of helping  users consume library services where <em>they</em> want. Way to go, John:-)</p>

<p>And as is the way of mashups, it's inspired an extension to my related MUTL entry showing how to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007298.html">bundle and display library related web feeds</a>: the Compleat Grazr/OPML Library Interface on Google:</p>

<p>Getting the Grazr gadget onto Google was easy using <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/tommorris/2006/06/24#grazrAndGoogleIgPartIiTheCowContraption">The Cow Contraption</a>, which takes an OPML file URL, mixes it with a Grazr URL and generates an 'add to Google' button for you: <a href="http://fusion.google.com/add?moduleurl=http%3A//www.bbcity.co.uk/tom/cowcontraption.php?opml=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml&height=400 &title=Grazr&es=es.xml"><img src="http://buttons.googlesyndication.com/fusion/add.gif" width="104" height="17" border="0" alt="Add to Google" /></a></p>

<p><img alt="grazrGoogleig.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrGoogleig.jpg" width="686" height="489" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another related 'getting the libray out there' approach that didn't appear in the MUTL competition, though I was hoping it would, was the display of library services on Netvibes.</p>

<p>Here's my take on it so far:</p>

<ol><li>personal info:

<p><img alt="nvOUdemos.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/nvOUdemos.jpg" width="749" height="528" border="0" /></li><li>Journal info:</p>

<p><img alt="nvJournals.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/nvJournals.jpg" width="749" height="528" border="0" /></li><li>Course related info - in this case from the <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">OU MyOpenLibrary service</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="nvMyOL.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/nvMyOL.jpg" width="768" height="528" border="0" /></li></ol></p>

<p>All that's required to get this information onto Netvibes are the addresses of relevant web feeds - and a little bit of thought about how to organise them.</p>

<p>Usability is improved by  providing OPML files for bulk 'upload' of feeds to Netvibes, or, even better, the creation of <a href="http://eco.netvibes.com">shareable Netvibes tabs</a> which could be simply added to a user's profile. (If you search for <em>ouseful</em> on the <a href="http://eco.netvibes.com">Netvibes ecosystem</a>, you'll find my shareable tabs.)</p>

<p>I don't think that Netvibes supports groups -  or allows tab publishers to limit who is allowed to copy a tab, which might be useful in some circummstances? Anyway, the first step is surely to get some shareable library tabs up there?</p>

<p>(NB For Netvibes, also read <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>PS the MUTL competition continues...</p>

<blockquote>Rather than re-run the same competition again next year, we wish to encourage innovative work on an ongoing basis. As such, the competition web site reopens today, and will accept new entries. We will periodically assemble a team of judges to select the best submissions since the last time entries were judged. In addition, we will seek to reward particularly innovative or compelling examples on an ad hoc basis, outside the normal cycle of judging.</blockquote>

<p>Should I..? shall I...? Oh what the heck: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/MUTL06" rel="tag">MUTL06</a> - or has the tag been changed?</p>

<h3 class="title">Two More Library Related Greasemonkey Scripts</h3>

<p>So the midnight oil has run out and the last for entries to MUTL looms, so here's a couple more scripts that didn't get as far as I wanted, but that do work, after a fashion... </p>

<p>The rationale for offering two scripts up together is that they demonstrate different potential uses for making use of a Greasemonkey script (or Firefox extension derived from a Greasemonkey script using a script2extension converter such as the <a href="http://www.arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler.php">Arantius Greasemonkey script compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the two scripts: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mutlBookDetailsForm.user.js">book details form completion</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerAlpha0.2.user.js">OU Traveller</a> (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefuTravellerLib_0.2.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefuTravellerLib_0.2.xpi');return false;">OU Traveller as a Firefox extension</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Book Details Form Completion</strong><br />
This script builds on the one described in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007156.html">Lookup book Details</a> script. The original intention was to augment a very basic form that allowed library users to request a book for purchase by the OU library.</p>

<p>The new script (which runs over this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/demoBookDetailsForm.php">dummy book request form</a>) will complete the form, given an ISBN. Clicking on the 'Get Book Details' link will also create two new links: one to allow the book to be looked up in the OU library catalogue according to title, and another to provide an author look up.</p>

<p>I toyed with the idea of loading a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007304.html">Carousel Widget: Similar Books</a> into the page in an iframe (or using the JSON technique described in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007299.html">Wishlist Carousel</a> to pull the related books info into the page a a list) but time has run out on me for now.</p>

<p>The Greasemonkey script shows how functionality for new services can be trialled without making changes to production systems. In a managed computer environment, such as public access library machines, new functionality can be evaluated on a sample of machines by real users if scripts are installed a selection of public access terminals. </p>

<p>Scripts can also be used to demonstrate mooted new functionality by running it over live production systems...</p>

<p>That the script creates catalogue lookup links when the 'Get book details' link is clicked on rather than installing them at page load time is just to demonstrate how logic/workflow can be built into the script. Ultimately, the aim would be to produce a 'request this book service' that checked the user's requests against books currently in the library, notifiying the user if the book is already held. In addition, the service might optionally look up related books  - particulalry ones held by the library - to see if they would meet the user's needs.</p>

<p>Building the script also revealed several 'issues'.</p>

<p>The author lookup script, reused from another script submitted as an ,a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007292.html">earlier MUTL entry</a>, identified 'issues' in framing author queries on the Voyager catalogue.</p>

<p>The ability to lookup several books with one call to the catalogue is also lacking - for example, it would be handy to be able to obtain a set of URLs (e.g. form xISBN or thingISBN) and pass them all in a single ISBN lookup query to the server, receiving a single result page listing the availability of all the books queried about in the catalogue (even better if the catalogue offered this option natively).</p>

<p><strong>OU Traveller</strong></p>

<p>The OU Traveller script represents the continued development of several <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=%22ou%20traveller%22&IncludeBlogs=1149">OU Traveller</a> components, though again it is not as fully developed as I had hoped, particularly in terms of visual design and integration with the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005845.html">Voyager Library Catalogue Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>The functionality offered by the OU Traveller script (which runs when an ISBN like number is found in a URL, as for example on Amazon) includes:<br />
<ul><li>a lookup of the book in the OU library catalogue, with status report;</li><br />
<li>different actions dependent on the OU library catalogue report for that item; for example, if the book is not held by the library, then an option is provided to request the book, which calls the dummy library 'request a book' page and prepopulates the fields using information pulled from an Amazon webservice;</li><br />
<li>a link to cite the current book using a service provided by studentabc;</li><br />
<li>a lookup of the book on O'Reilly Safari (with a link to the item if it is held there);</li><br />
<li>a lookup of the item at Google books (with a link to the item if it is held there);</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>The look and feel of the panel still leaves something to be desired, as does the way the information is presented on it.</p>

<p>Also, at the current time, if several OU Traveller scripts are running, multiple panels may be created, although typically only one will be populated (withthe result that several scripts all arite results into the same panel). Observing this led me to realise that I should have created a standalone OU Traveller panel javascript library that can be loaded into OU Traveller scripts (or embedded in the OU Traveller Toolbar (forthcoming!)).</p>

<p>This library would check to see if a panel already exists (loaded by another script) before overlaying a panel on the page. If several OU Traveller scripts were loaded, they could all display results on the same OU Traveller panel.</p>

<p>The OU Traveller panel would thus in essence represent a 'widget environment' that could manage the displayed output from one or more OU Traveller scripts. In this way, different combinations of OU Traveller functionality could be assembled by loading different sets of OU Traveller scripts, yet all the reports would be displayed b the same, common interface panel.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in working this idea up with me further, I would very much appreciate it :-)</p>

<p>As it is, each time I go in to the OU Traveller script, I try to abstract functionality out a little more, hopefully making individual components a little more reusable as I do so. However, a professional coder I am not, so the abstractions may be a little quirky at times and they are unlikely to fully exploit the power of good Javascript practice!</p>

<p>Perhaps more so than the book details lookup script, this script can be used by an individual in their own browser, although as with the other script it could also be preloaded on to public acces machines.</p>

<h3 class="title">Displaying New Library Books</h3>

<p>Many libraries are starting to make feeds of their new books available, but few make any further attempts to either exploit these feeds, or help others exploit them.</p>

<p>In an earlier<a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">MUTL</a> entry (<em><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007298.html">The Compleat Grazr/OPML Library Interface, v 0.0.1</a></em>), I doodled one way in which a new books feed could be mixed with other library feeds in an OPML feed bundle that could provide a wide ranging view of library feeds within a single, OPML fed browser widget.</p>

<p>That exercise, in conjunction with the one described in this post, also led me to realise <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007305.html">how ropey</a> many feeds produced by libraries - including the OU - actually are. mainly, I suspect, because they are produced in a rush of 'What can we feed? Err, I know, new books" enthusiasm and then left published but untested on a public page that no-one ever uses.</p>

<p>In the post <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007299.html">Wishlist Carousel</a> I showed how a JSON feed could be used to feed book data into a carousel widget  that would display the resource linked book covers in a space efficient way, an approach I then developed in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007304.html">Carousel Widget: Similar Books</a>, which accepted an ISBN as part of a URL and then displayed a carousel of related books (as defined by an Amazon webservice call).</p>

<p>A later post (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007303.html">OU New Library Books Bookshelf</a>) showed how a server based application hosted on <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>) (a free application development and hosting site) could be used to consume a new books feed and push it into a carousel widget.</p>

<p>I finally managed to get a couple of hours in tonight finishing that demo, so here it is, YAOMUTLE (yet another OUseful MUTL Entry). This one is hosted on Ning, so you should be able to see the (small amount of) PHP code by signing up and cloning the app. There are a few other litterlike files around, but I don't have time to tidy up right now. I do have ideas about how to make this a proper social and shareable app, but no time to even blog them, let alone execute them. (If anyone wants to lend me a coder for a week or two, or even a day or two, please get in touch!;-)</p>

<p>MUTL entry: <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com/">Consuming library new books feeds</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="ounewbooksfeedinterpret.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ounewbooksfeedinterpret.jpg" width="438" height="399" border="0" /></p>

<p>There is a little bit of interpretation on the site linked to above, but points to note are:<br />
<ol><li>the original source feed is parsed server side and used to populate the carousel widget;</li><br />
<li>hovering over an image in the carousel widget causes several sorts of content to be loaded into the various tab display panels, which all contain <em>iframes</em>;</li><br />
<li>the book info, contents, author notes and excerpt are delivered as HTML pages from Syndetics; the related items come from an XSLT applied to a RESTful,  XML returning webservice call to Amazon webservices.</li></ol></p>

<p>The entry reuses (not necessarily mashes!):<br />
<ol><li>Bill Scott's <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">Carousel component</a>;</li><br />
<li>Patrick Fitzgerald's <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/index.php">tabber script</a>;</li><br />
<li>Alan Taylor's <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2006/05/consuming-amazons-web-api-directly.html">Amazon2JSON xslt</a></li><br />
<li>an Amazon webservice (<a href="http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemLookup&ContentType=text%2Fxml&SubscriptionId=0DK8EWAWVKXSH8SEMVR2&ItemId=0596009208&ResponseGroup=Similarities">similar items lookup</a>;</li><br />
<li>Syndetics 'catalog enrichment' content.</li></ol></p>

<p>The stuff's out there, folks, you just have to put it together in new ways...</p>

<p>So lobby the management to give you more playtime...</p>

<p>And if they ask 'why?', say the Corporate Fool said so...</p>

<h3 class="title">In Need of Standardisation: Library Feeds (New Books)</h3>

<p>I've just been tinkering with a way of displaying, and hopefully adding value to "new books in the library" feeds (a development of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007303.html">this post</a> that can be found in evolving form at <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com">ouseful.ning.com</a>) and I've hit a ***huge*** problem.</p>

<p>None standardised feed descriptions.</p>

<p>Actually - I should rephrase that - <em>feeds that don't identify an ISBN within the link or description tag for each item somewhere</em>. What I had hoped was to be able to write a regular expression that would parse link and description fields looking for things that stood a good chance of being ISBNs, and using these to key the added value items (book cover, cotnents, dscription etc.)</p>

<p>Maybe more by luck than judgement, I'd picked an OU feed (maybe the only feed?) that had a link structure for each item that contained an ISBN. I scraped this to index in to various other services (book cover, for example, as well as book description and book contents listings).</p>

<p>However, it seems that most of the other feeds use a different way of describing the links (e.g. look at the link tag <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/agriculture.xml">here</a>  (<em>http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=349200</em>) and <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/ict.xml">here</a> (<em>http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=0120884364&Search_Code=ISBN&SL=None&CNT=10</em>).</p>

<p>And there is no useful description info (though some of the feeds give location info - such as classmark and whereabouts the book is in the library - in the ddescription field).<br />
 <br />
Admittedly the BBID link is cleaner - but how repurposable is each BBID? Is there a BBID2ISBN converter (and v.v.?)? And if so, is it available as a webservice? (which would be another shed load of hits on the server?)</p>

<p>So when I came to check the script with other OU new books feeds (they are arranged by topic) I found they don't work...:-(</p>

<p>Having a quick trawl of other libraries (just Google <em>library new books rss</em>) you'll find there are as many - if not more - ways of "defining" a new books feed as there are libraries who publish them.</p>

<p>Not being a librarian, or even working for a library, yet reading a lot of Library 2.0 blogs, I've noticed there seems to be a lot of gripes in the community about vendors locking data up and making it hard to repurpose.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it seems that an increasing number of people are managing to subvert the system and produce feeds - like new books feeds - using their own scripts.</p>

<p>Just like in the OU.</p>

<p>But when I started using the OU library feeds 'properly' a week or two ago, I discovered that many of them were broken/didn't validate, had lots of nonsense elements in (e.g. that broke links) and so on.</p>

<p>And looking through a handful of feeds from a handful of other sites just now, I find exactly the same pattern - feeds with item description links that all point to the <em>same</em> catalogue entry for different items, feeds with broken links (you can't have spaces and words in a link - it just won't work...it seems that many library catalogues give out junk at the end of a link - so you have to clean it! (here's a tip - try running your feeds through <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/">http://rss.scripting.com/</a>).</p>

<p>PS whilst looking at the various library feeds, I also had a look at feeds from <a href="http://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>. It seems these books are referenced according to a LibraryThing number which potentially maps onto several ISBNs (i.e. different versions of a particular book). I haven't checked to see if there is a strict one-one or many-one mapping between ISBN and LibraryThing number. Either way, an API that did round trip ISBN/LibraryThing number mappings would be handy (similary for ISBNs and OCLC numbers).</p>

<p>PPS Yes I know ISBNs are dodgy things (as the previous PS shows) but for a new book in the library, it almost definitely will have a single ISBN (not one of several possible ISBNs) associated with it, won't it? (Or won't it? I'm talking 80% of the time here...). </p>

<p>In which case, can we please, please, please try and find a way of exposing it in a consistent way in new books feeds - and then we can build some reusable and scalable apps that can be used to demo services generally and not have to be specially built for each particular feed at each particular site...</p>

<p>(Maybe the citation microformat effort will be able to help out here? Or maybe standardised use of Dublin Core? Just by the by, this list of <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/08/namespaced-extensions-in-feeds.html">RSS Feed namespaced extensions</a> came through on today's news).</p>

<h3 class="title">OU New Library Books Bookshelf</h3>

<p>Having got Bill Scott's <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/y-ui-carousel-component">YUI Carousel extension</a> working with JSON fed data <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wishlistCarousel.html">here</a>, I thought I should try to use it to display OU Library new books data, for which there are <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">more than a few feeds</a> available.</p>

<p>For a change, I thought I'd try and handle this user some server scripts to consume the feed, so I built the demo at <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>, which I've been meaning try out for some time.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot:<br />
 <br />
<img alt="ningCarouselDemo.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ningCarouselDemo.jpg" width="570" height="483" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here's a link to the app: <a href="http://ouseful.ning.com">OUseful@Ning</a>.</p>

<p>As well as pulling book cover info in, and offering a link back to the OU Voyager catalogue entry for each item, if you hover over the cover art for a book, the app will pull in the book desctiption (if available) from <a href="http://syndetics.com">Syndetics</a>, (who also provide the cover art).</p>

<h3 class="title">The Compleat Grazr/OPML Library Interface, v 0.0.1</h3>

<p><em>Preamble:</em> In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007296.html">So What Exactly Are Library Feeds Good For?</a> I showed several screenshots that demonstrated how a wide variety of library related feeds could be aggregated using an OPML file and displayed within the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> OPML browser. In this post, I discuss this 'presentational mashup' in a little more detail, and offer it up as a entry to the Talis <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashuip Competition</a>.</p>

<p>More and more libraries are making web feeds (RSS and Atom feeds) available covering a wide variety of Library related services including, but not limited to:<ul><br />
<li>patrons' library details (e.g. current loans and overdue books);</li><br />
<li>lists of new books in the library;</li><br />
<li>lists of institional open access/OAI eprints;</li><br />
<li>lists of print and ejournal subscriptions;</li><br />
<li>Opensearch-like feeds from library catalogues;</li><br />
<li>subject librarian recommended websites/resources.</li><br />
</ul>...as well as Library news, events or blog feeds, wiki update feeds, and so on...</p>

<p>In addition, many content providers make book or journal information available via syndication or other XML feeds, such as:<ul><br />
<li>book contents and summaries;</li><br />
<li>book cover graphics;</li><br />
<li>journal current issue contents and abstracts;</li><br />
<li>persistent search results.</li><br />
</ul>Certainly within my own academic library, I have been pushing for the publication of ever more feeds <em>just because</em>, with little thought about how they may best be used.</p>

<p>Many of these feeds have been created rather 'casually', and on inspection/attempted use do not validate (e.g. using a validator such as the one found at <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/">rss.scripting.com</a>, such is the pace<br />
at which some of these feeds were produced. That some of the feeds remained online with errors<br />
for so long also suggests that uptake of/subscription to them is very low indeed.</p>

<p>One of the "live" issues for the OU library at the current time is how best to integrate<br />
library services within the new Moodle VLE that is being developed for course delivery from 2007.</p>

<p>There are  several key issues when considering library service integration, not least among<br />
them:<ol><br />
<li>What services are users likely to use?</li><br />
<li>when and where are users likely to require these services?</li><br />
<li>what sort of interface should e used to deliver these services?</li><br />
</ol>In any learning environment, screen real estate tends to be a carefully managed resource, with diffferent areas of the environment exposing different services.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is clear - if library services are consigned to their own page, they are likely to become ghettoised within the VLE and are unlikely to be used 'in context'  - if at all - by the majority of users. One click away may be be one click away too many.</p>

<p>However, if all the library services could be collected together in an easily navigated, small embedded library panel, then they could be made available at the point of use.</p>

<p>The embedded Grazr OPML browser shown below demonstrates a first attempt at a) scoping out what feeds/services might be included in a feed based library interface; and b) displaying such feeds in a compact manner.</p>

<div style="height:400px; width:400px"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?font=arial&amp;fontsize=9pt&amp;linktarget=_blank&amp;file=http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml"></script><a href="http://grazr.com"><img style="border:none" src="http://grazr.com/images/gzlogo.png" alt="grazr" onload="GrazrLoad(this)" /></a></div>

<p>You can find a copy of the OPML file that feeds the above example at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml</a>. Note that this file does not contain a link to my (authenticated) user details.</p>

<p>The OPML file has the following structure:</p>

<p>...<br />
&lt;outline text="New Books" &gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="New books: ICT" xmlUrl="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/ict.xml" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="New books: Adult and Continuing Education" xmlUrl="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/adultconted.xml" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/outline&gt;<br />
&lt;outline text="Journal Current Issues"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="The Computer Journal" xmlUrl="http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/rss/current.xml" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;outline type="rss" text="IEEE Pervasive Computing" xmlUrl="http://csdl.computer.org/rss/pervasive.xml" /&gt<br />
&lt;/outline&gt;<br />
...</p>

<p>The &lt;outline text=""&gt; links define 'directories' (which may be nested, I think).</p>

<p>The &lt;outline type="rss"&gt; links define the feeds that are contained within each 'directory'.</p>

<p>To generate your own OPML file, save the OPML file linked to above, and then open it in a  text browser. Replace the headings and feeds with your own headings and feeds, save the file and upload it to webserver. You can then view the file via <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html">http://grazr.com/config.html</a></p>

<p>As stated above, my feed bundle is just a first attempt - it does not include a section for librarian blogs, or library news and events, for example (though it could easily consume my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful blog feed</a>, and maybe even an iCal (or other calendar generated) feed).</p>

<p>If  you are a librarian out there who wants to join in the mashup competition, but perhaps don't have the programming skills required to build a 'technical' mashup, why not post some alternative OPML feed bundles that demonstrate differently structured interfaces to the library system?</p>

<p>Alternatively, why not show off differnt feed mixes using a webtop such as Google/ig, Netvibes, or Pageflakes?</p>

<p>Or come up with a library customised page on Zimbio?</p>

<p>All these are - I believe - acceptable things to enter into the mashuip competition...</p>

<p>Remember - the feeds are increasingly out there, but how many people use them. (Do you?). We are still to find effective ways for the majority of users to use them, and coming up with sensible feed mixes - and ways of consuming those mixes <em>in context</em> - are, I believe, still lacking...</p>

<p><em>For the purposes of the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Talis "Mashup the Library" Competition, 2006</a> my submission is actually a two part submission: firstly, the demonstrated use of OPML to bundle library related feeds and display them in an integrated, and page embeddable, way using Grazr; secondly, the selection and organisation of feeds bundled together in the full version of the  OPML file demonstrated on this page (i.e. the version of the file that includes patron loan/overdue books details (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007296.html">screenshots</a>).</em></p>

<p>I would , however, encourage other people to submit 'rival' OPML files to the competition showing different ways of mixing library related feeds in a single OPML file. Being a lazy type, if someone else can find an effective mix that I can pinch, it saves me the trouble;- )</p>

<p>PS When I get a chance, I will post a screencast of the browser in action here...</p>

<p>PPS Ideally, of course, what we really need is an easy to use tool that allows users to straightforwardly create a library feed mix...<br />

<h3 class="title">So What Exactly Are Library Feeds Good For?</h3>

<p>Every day, yet another library seems to proudly boast that it has set up a raft of Library feeds (I myself produly announced this fact several times when the OU library started to open up feeds for all sorts of things). But I found myself wondering last night: why? What good does it do?</p>

<p>And so I set about trying to bundle feeds together so that I could live outside the library pages, just surviving off the feeds the library provides.</p>

<p>One environment within which I could develop my own customised, feed fed library page is Netvibes, of course, and I'll post a demo page or two using that space in a week or two.</p>

<p>But for now, here's a demo of using the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> OPML browser as a surrogate library website.</p>

<p>I should at this point say that the demo does not just use OU Library feeds - the OpenSearch feeds from the catalogue are due along anytime, but they're not quite ready yet. So I've borrowed some from elsewhere (from <a href="http://www.hclib.org/pub/search/RSS.cfm">Hennepin County Library</a>, in fact).</p>

<p>So - here then are the feeds that go into the mix:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryTop.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryTop.jpg" width="402" height="410" border="0" /></p>

<ul><li>My Library Feeds;</li>
<li>New books in the OU Library;</li>
<li>S804 (an OU course) <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> links;</li>
<li>current contents lists for a selection of journals;</li>
<li>a couple of saved persistent searches on the Hennepin County Library catalogue;</li>
<li>recent eprints (from Glasgow - the OU feed is firewalled...)</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of my library feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyDetails.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyDetails.jpg" width="244" height="73" border="0" /></p>

<p>and then:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryOnLoan.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryOnLoan.jpg" width="407" height="341" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here are some book details:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryBookDetails.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryBookDetails.jpg" width="413" height="105" border="0" /></p>

<p>(maybe nice if the contents lists, or a summary description were pulled in to this feed, perhaps?). Clicking the link should take you through to the linrary catalgue page for that book (but there's a tiny error in the link at the mo...)</p>

<p>The overdue library books feed works too - oops...:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryOverdue.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryOverdue.jpg" width="410" height="80" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryNewBooks.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryNewBooks.jpg" width="300" height="77" border="0" /></p>

<p>which are handled just like the books in my library record (clicking on a feed leads to a list of books, and clicking on one of those leads to book details).</p>

<p>The MyOpenLibrary feeds are feeds of resources, sorted by topic, and selected by subject area experts to be relevant to the particular course:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLFeeds.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLFeeds.jpg" width="250" height="122" border="0" /></p>

<p>What's neat about the Journals feed:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLJournals.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLJournals.jpg" width="401" height="205" border="0" /></p>

<p>is that if you click through to a particular journal:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryMyOLJournalsItem.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryMyOLJournalsItem.jpg" width="391" height="87" border="0" /></p>

<p>when you follow the link you open in a new tab the libezproxied journal page (i.e. you are logged in to it...).</p>

<p>The same should be true with the database links, but I'm not sure they're set up correctly (they still seem to be using athens, which I thought we'd stop using?). Anyway, <em>in principle</em> you should be able to just click through straight into a logged in page on the daatbase site.</p>

<p>The Current Journal Issues feeds are just a few I pulled together from different publishers' sites.</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalIssues.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalIssues.jpg" width="344" height="103" border="0" /></p>

<p>It would be nice to automatically reconcile feeds from <a href="http://zetoc.mimas.ac.uk/">Zetoc</a> with the Journal feeds from MyOL, for example, but I'm not sure if there is an ISSN2feed url service available form Zetoc?</p>

<p>Clicking on a journal gives the current contents list:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalContents.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalContents.jpg" width="412" height="285" border="0" /></p>

<p>and clicking through to an item displays the abstract:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryJournalAbstract.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryJournalAbstract.jpg" width="415" height="269" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment clicking the link opens up a tab containing the journal web page for that article. Idellay this would be libezproxified first...</p>

<p>The persistent library search feeds are canned searches I predefined when I wrote the OPML fle that drives this Grazr demo:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearch.jpg" width="353" height="86" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here are some results:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearchResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearchResults.jpg" width="379" height="209" border="0" /></p>

<p>A neat thing about the book details page is the way the book cover image is also pulled in:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryPerSearchItem.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryPerSearchItem.jpg" width="382" height="198" border="0" /></p>

<p>Finally, the ePrints feed (in this case, borrowed from Glasgow):</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryeprints.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryeprints.jpg" width="256" height="61" border="0" /></p>

<p>again giving results that link through to result item abstracts and if necessary on to the actual report in the eprint repository:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrLibraryeprintsResults.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryeprintsResults.jpg" width="417" height="224" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to have a play, I popped a demo (less the My Library feeds which use my library authentication details) at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrLibraryDemo.html">Library OPML browser demo</a>. </p>

<p>Update: Alternatively, check out this <a href="http://optimalbrowser.com/optimal.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59%2FousefulLibraryTest.opml&submit=Submit">Optimal browser view</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="optimalOUView.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/optimalOUView.jpg" width="374" height="446" border="0" /></p>

<p>[NB hopefully dummy user details will be available soon to demonstrate the <em>My Library Details</em> feeds.]</p>

<p>You can see a copy of the OPML file <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLibraryTest.opml">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note that the only thing that I had to do to create this demo was to write the OPML file (I copied another OPML file to get the structure qnd fiund the feeds URLs wherever) and upload it to a server; I then pasted the URL of the uploaded OPML file into the config box on <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html">http://grazr.com/config.html</a> and copyied the HTML that was generated into a dummy web page. Uploading this to the server provided me with my demo. For reference, I spent far longer blogging the demo than I did crreating it...</strong></p>

<p>PS I'm glad to see that some 'proper' mashups are starting to appear in the Talis Library Mashup competition, such as <a href=" http://www.bibliopage.com/">Bibliopage</a>. But it would also be nice to see simple stuff that any old librarian can use, without them having to know one end of a  client-server script from the other. So I wonder, are simple, simple presentation based mashups that just encourage people to wire up content in neat ways to legacy presentational devices likely to be accepted as valid entries? Any chance of Talis offering 100 or a similar token amount (or maybe just an Amazon gift voucher?) for the best use of Netvibes (or similar) for displaying library related feeds?</p>

<h3 class="title">Amazon2OU Library Pivot Browsing</h3>

<p>All seems quiet on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Talis Library Mashup Competition</a>, so for what it's worth, here's an early entry... a <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> script that demonstrates a few ways of making use of an ISBN that's contained within a page URL.</p>

<p>So here it is:</p>

<p><hr /><br />
<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerBookDetails.user.js">OUTravellerBookDetailsScript</a> script that will:</p>

<p>1) extract something that looks like an ISBN from a page URL;</p>

<p>2) if it finds a candidate ISBN, it will pop up a small user panel, that will:<br />
a) Provide a link to a service that will create a citation for the book described by that ISBN at <a href="http://www.studentabc.com/">Studentabc.com</a>;<br />
b) Provide a link to look up the author of that book in the OU library catalogue (<a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk">voyager.open.ac.uk</a>);<br />
c) Provide a link to look up the title of that book in the OU library catalogue.</p>

<p><img alt="OUTravellerBookDetails.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUTravellerBookDetails.jpg" width="439" height="248" border="0" /></p>

<p>The information used for the catalogue and citation lookups is obtained by a call to the Amazon web service using the ISBN extracted from the page URL as a key.</p>

<p>The call to the citation creating service is made using a form created dynamically within the page by the GM script.</p>

<p><img alt="studentabcCitation.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/studentabcCitation.jpg" width="655" height="299" border="0" /></p>

<p>The links to the library catalogue demonstrate the construction of a normal/RESTful URL.</p>

<p>The title of the post suggests pivot browsing, so I guess what I mean here is that the script demonstrates how an ISBN pulled from an Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Ottakars, etc. page URL can be used to "pivot search" into the OU library catalogue by Title or Author.</p>

<p>The script does actually tuen up some things about the catalogue I didn't appreciate too, such as it's non-intuitive way of dealing with author search (at least, I couldnl;t work out what was going on). As a result, I've hacked a heuristic to pass (sometimes!) the first author's surname, follwed by their first intitial (maybe...). If I get chance, I'll try and work on this more...</p>

<p>As to why I used the Amazon webservice for the book details lookup - simply because I expect most (if any) people using the script to use it for books browsed on Amazon...</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>The script isn't a demonstration of a major league mashup by any means - it's more at the level of simple lego bricks... because whilst I look forward to seeing some heavyweight library mashups submitted to this competition, I was also hoping to see some entrants showing off tiny demos of particular tricks and tips that I could reuse;-) (It's much easier pulling a function out of a script that's 50 lines long in total than searching for it in a several hundred, or thousand, lines of code...).</p>

<p>Indeed, one thing I'd like to see come out of the TDN competition is a set of library mashup design patterns, a bit like the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/index.php:">Yahoo User Interface design patterns</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Patterns are optimal solutions to common problems. As common problems are tossed around a community and are resolved, common solutions often spontaneously emerge. Eventually, the best of these rise above the din and self-identify and become refined until they reach the status of a Design Pattern.</blockquote>
[<a href="http://www.iawiki.net/WebsitePatterns">IAWiki</a>]

<p>According to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/page.php?page=lifecycle">Yahoo developer site</a>, a pattern has four primary components: a title, a problem, a context and a solution. User Interface patterns can be effectivley demonstrated with simple screen shots.</p>

<p>For the mashup competition, I think it would be really handy if there was a stream demonstrating fucntional design patterns, backed up with simple bits of code (in whatever language) implementing the proposed pattern. If possible/appropriate, a demo of both server side (PHP, say) and client side (javascript)   code would add even more value...</p>

<p>Anyway - that's as maybe, and something I aspire to rather than something I am actually going to put into practise tonight...because it's late and I just want to get this thing posted...</p>

<p>The script is not offered as a 'production service' application, although it should work. The styling leaves somethign to be desired, but I'm not a designer (I wish I could work the <a href="http://37signals.com">37 Signals</a> way!).</p>

<p>However, I hope it encourages other people to submit tiny, tiny exemplars of mashup components over the next few weeks that may be generally useful. I suspect there aren't that many people out there who are either capable of, or have time to, develop heavyweight apps (and I wouldn't expect these to be submitted until the final submission day anyway!), but in the meantime, why not share any snippets you might have? Who knows, maybe the Talis folks will give a prize to the smallest/simplest mashup???</p>

<h3 class="title">Cite This Book</h3>

<p>Kirsty Baker in the Library passed me a couple of links today to services that render citation details in a recognised citation format: <a href="http://citationmachine.net/">Citation Machine</a>and <a href="http://www.studentabc.com/builder">StudentABC Citation Composer</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the latter:</p>

<p><img alt="studentABCform.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/studentABCform.jpg" width="681" height="497" border="0" /></p>

<p>This sort of tool looks like it may provide a useful starting point for teaching students about citation formats, in advance of moving them up to full blown citation management tools, (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006110.html">RefWorks</a> is the service we make available to students).</p>

<p>It's also something that's easily integrated into the OU Traveller script by reusing the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007156.html">book details</a> code I posted a few days ago, which you may remember looks up the details of a book given its ISBN using an Amazon webservice, creates a form mimicking a form somewhere else on the web, completes the form using the book details from Amazon and then posts the form automatically. Anyway, here's the demo - a cut down OU Traveller form:<br />
 <br />
<img alt="OUtravellerCite.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUtravellerCite.jpg" width="562" height="432" border="0" /></p>

<p>The citation that's generated:</p>

<p><img alt="studentABCcite.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/studentABCcite.jpg" width="552" height="192" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's even editable:</p>

<p><img alt="studentABCedit.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/studentABCedit.jpg" width="548" height="392" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's the script: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerCite.user.js">OU Traveller - book citation.</a></p>

<p>Now I wonder, does the library catalogue have links to common citation style formats from book records in the catalogue?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here's a bookmarklet that will take the user to the 'cite this web page' form: <a href="javascript:function v(n,v){el=d.createElement('input');el.type='text';el.name=n;el.value=v;f.appendChild(el);};void(d=document);void(uri='http://www.studentabc.com/app/action/Search');void(f=d.createElement('form'));void(f.method='post');void(f.action=uri);v('term',d.location.href);d.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();">Cite this page</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Traveller - Request This Book</h3>

<p>I knocked up (out of other bits) a script today that adds a link to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007069.html">OU Traveller panel</a> when a book is not found in the OU Library that makes it easy for the user request the book in question. Clicking the link will (almost...) fire off a request to order that book using the the Library's official request a book form.</p>

<p>Building the script has thrown up a few usability issues regarding the actual library form. (Which is why I say the form almost works; it can be made to work completely by adding user details or by making a minor change or two to the orignal form and form handler, such as putting in a confirmation screen so the user can check the details that have been submitted.)</p>

<p>[Update: another (better?) alternative might be to pop up a dialogue to allow a user to enter their personal details if they want to reserve a book? If this info could also be saved into the Amazon cookie withuot upsetting Amazon, that might be neat?]</p>

<p>As the actual library form requires user info (not provided by the Greasmonkey script) this suggests that I need to tweak the GM script so that it supports user customisation, and then I either: a) build a GM script generator that builds a personal script when provided with user details, or b) embed the script in toolbar or other FF extension that provides a user preferences dialogue.</p>

<p>The new script builds heavily on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007156.html">Lookup Book Details</a> script (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007165.html">public demo version</a>) and can be found here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerRequest.user.js">OU Traveller Request This Book</a> Greasemonkey script.</p>

<p>The main innovation in this script is the reuse of the this test <a href="javascript:function v(n,v){el=d.createElement('input');el.type='text';el.name=n;el.value=v;f.appendChild(el);};void(d=document);void(uri='http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php');void(f=d.createElement('form'));void(f.method='post');void(f.action=uri);v('name','Hirst');v('email','a.j.hirst@open.ac.uk');v('faculty','Technology');v('dateofpub','2006');v('author','TESTING');v('itemtitle','PLEASE IGNORE');d.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();"bookmarklet</a> which mimicked the behaviour of the original <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php">request a book</a> page. (If there is interest, I can post a version of this script for the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007165.html">demo page</a>.)</p>

<p>What the script does is create a form element, and populate it with input fields (of type <em>text</em>) to mimic the fields in the form on the original page. The inputs are assigned values from the relevant items in an XML details page (keyed by ISBN) that is requested from the Amazon web service (returning something like this: <a href="http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemLookup&ContentType=text%2Fxml&SubscriptionId=0DK8EWAWVKXSH8SEMVR2&ItemId=0849304563&ResponseGroup=Images,ItemAttributes">book details from Amazon</a> (link obtained via <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ISBNLinks.html">ISBN Links Generator</a>)).</p>

<h3 class="title">Amazon Media Library</h3>

<p>Stumbling around looking for information about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/edocs">Amazon eDocs</a> (about which maybe more another day) I came across an interesting post from <a href="http://www.resourceshelf.com">ResourceShelf</a> about <a href="http://www.resourceshelf.com/2006/05/22/amazons-search-inside-the-book-gets-a-new-look-with-new-amazononlinereader-and-your-media-library/">Amazon's New  online Reader and Media Library</a>. Again, the online reader/search inside service I'll maybe post about another day, because what caught my interest was the write up about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/16386681/102-9809476-3868122">Amazon Personal Media Library</a> (<a href="http://scilib.typepad.com/science_library_pad/2006/07/amazonthing.html">Richard Akerman</a> also spotted the Media Library just now, as well as a tidy URL for the service: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/library/">www.amazon.com/gp/library/</a>).</p>

<p>An Amazon<em>.com</em> (not <em>.co.uk</em> etc.) service, the <em>Your  Media Library</em> service:</p>

<blockquote>... is a secure location to store information about all of your media purchases as well as access your digital products, such as eBooks, eDocs, Amazon Upgrades, Amazon Shorts, the free electronic user manuals that come with some products, and free music files and video clips that are available with select CDs and other multimedia products.</blockquote>

<p>This particularly caught my eye because the library interface is built around a bookshelf metaphor (something regular readers will know I've been tracking lately, e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007105.html">here, in respect of ejournal OPML feeds</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007024.html">here, in respect of library books</a>).</p>

<p><img alt="amazonMediaLibrary.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonMediaLibrary.jpg" width="734" height="479" border="0" /></p>

<p>A similar display style is used for media items, using cover artwork:</p>

<p><img alt="amazonMediaLibraryMusic.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonMediaLibraryMusic.jpg" width="675" height="324" border="0" /></p>

<p>Items can be added based around a search, or from ASINs/ISBNs etc.</p>

<p><img alt="amazonMediaLibraryAddItem.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonMediaLibraryAddItem.jpg" width="220" height="196" border="0" /></p>

<p>If I was an Amazon.com customer, then any of my future purchases (and maybe my previous ones?) could be added automatically to my media library. What would be really useful for me here in the UK though (and assuming that the Media Library won't be available to .co.uk cusotmers in the near term) would be the ability to upload all the purchaces from my Amazon.co.uk account to my media library on the .com site.</p>

<p>A feed of items from my Media Library would also be handy (cf. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006280.html">Amazon wishlist feeds</a>, as would be the ability to upload titems to my media library from a feed (e.g. from <a href="http://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> or my OU library current loans feeds (maybe this would have to  be on a tempoary shelf?).</p>

<p>The Media Library allows tagging, and display of items tagged in a particular way, but I don't think there is a way of showing several separate shelves on different themes.</p>

<p>Nor does there appear to be a way of automatically viewing wishlist items on a wishlist shelf.</p>

<p>Just in passing, this additional, related service also caught my eye: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/110744011/102-9809476-3868122">Amazon Upgrade</a>, which supports "upgrading" of phyisical (i.e. print) books with an online version:</p>

<blockquote>Upgrading Your Physical Books is Easy
If you buy a book that is in the Amazon Upgrade program, you are given the option to upgrade to online access at the end of the purchase process.</blockquote>

<p>This is something I'm going to have to mentally mix in with my thinking on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006669.html">O'Reilly's SafariU</a> for potential OUseful use! ;-)</p>

<p>And I think I'm also going to have to do a version of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">OU Course Catalogue Takes Lead from Amazon?</a> that considers ways in which the Library catalogue pages could ape Amazon (as opposed to  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006401.html">Amazon-Supported Library Services</a>) and maybe also a version of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006074.html">Customer Participation at Amazon.com</a> looking at how <a href="http://oci.open.ac.uk">OCI</a> might foster community spirit...</p>

<h3 class="title">OUTraveller: Lookup Book Details</h3>

<p>Another potential component for the OU Library Traveller Script, this part representing the first step towards implementing a suggestion made by Mark Stride for a routine that would allow a user to request a library book purchase if the book wasn't found in the OU Library catalogue from a lookup on an Amazon book page.</p>

<p>To break the problem down, I've implemented a function that will add a button/link to the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php">request a book page</a> (internal only, I think...) that will complete the request form given an ISBN.</p>

<p>For example, here's before a lookup (the <em>Get Book Details</em> link is added by the script):</p>

<p><img alt="getBookDetailsBefore.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/getBookDetailsBefore.jpg" width="590" height="212" border="0" /></p>

<p>and here's after:</p>

<p><img alt="getBookDetailsAfter.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/getBookDetailsAfter.jpg" width="583" height="208" border="0" /></p>

<p>The book details are actually pulled in from Amazon, via a RESTful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/102-9809476-3868122?ie=UTF8&node=3435361">Amazon webservice</a>, though there are alternatives (e.g. the info/xml links generated by the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ISBNLinks.html">ISBN Links Generator</a>).</p>

<p>The script is a little tatty, especially in the way the form elements are identified (raw counting!). However, the "request a book" page is due to be redesigned, and so it may be that the functionality this script provides will actually be built into the next version. (I'll also try and get the page marked up semantically).</p>

<p>If you want to try out the script, here it is: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libSuggestDetails.user.js">Complete book details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've posted over the w/e about a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007165.html">public demo</a> of this service.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Traveller GM Script - Multiple Lookups</h3>

<p>Last night, I tidied up the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007069.html">OU Library Traveller</a> script a little so that additional lookups for a particular ISBN can be quickly added to the script.</p>

<p>The result is something like this:</p>

<h3 class="title">BlogBridge Library</h3>

<p>Last week, I managed to get a <a href="http://blogbridge.com/trial1/">trial user account</a> on the new BlogBridge Library, which I briefly posted about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007024.html">here</a>  when the demo was launched.</p>

<p>The BlogBridge Library provides you with a space to manage feeds using a metaphor I described previously as akin to a bookshelf. What really appeals to me is how this sort of display might be useful in managing the display of contents feeds from online journals.  In use, I imagine myself to be stood in the library by the journals collection, leafing through print journals, scanning their contents lists and perhaps flicking through an abstract or two...</p>

<p><img alt="journalBookshelf.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/journalBookshelf.JPG" width="548" height="163" border="0" /></p>

<p>Each shelf display 4 titles at a time, with up to 4 sets of 4 titles being supported on the bookshelf at any one time. </p>

<p>One feature that might be useful here would be the ability to choose the image that should be displayed as the bookshelf graphic. (At the moment, the image is an image of the webpage that hosts the target feed, obtained as an <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=126">Alexa site thumbnail image</a>.)</p>

<p>For collections containing more than 4 x 4 = 16 titles, clicking through the bookshelf title bar reveals all the titles on the bookshelf:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFullShelf.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFullShelf.jpg" width="520" height="494" border="0" /></p>

<p>The above shelf image (i.e. the singlerow of 4 titles) shows the result of importing an OPML file  of feeds <em>live from the web</em> (from <a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/help/oxfordjournals.opml.xml">here</a>, in this case) into the BBLibrary.</p>

<p>Although you can see an OPML feed of the uploaded feeds is available, feeds from the individual journals are not, which I take to be a bug, as this other bookshelf (representing an upload of an OPML fiel from my hard drive, generated by my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseLinksOPML.html">course OPML generator</a>) suggests:</p>

<p><img alt="bblS804.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblS804.jpg" width="530" height="188" border="0" /></p>

<p>Nested folders on a shelf are also supported, as this <a href="http://npg.nature.com/pdf/newsfeeds.opml">OPML list of Nature Publishing Group journal feeds</a> (see <a href="http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_newsfeed.xml&style=xml/02_newsfeed.xsl">here</a>) demonstrates:</p>

<p><img alt="bblNested.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblNested.jpg" width="537" height="160" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking throught the bookshelf title bar takes you to a 'sub' bookshelf containing shelves for each nested bundle of feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="bblNestedFull.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblNestedFull.jpg" width="534" height="533" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing that would be neat here would be for the system to generate a separate OPML file for each shelf in this collection, and provide a link to this file both from these 'sub'bookshelfs, but also from the folder view.</p>

<p>Again, I think there may be a minor bug in the sysitem here becuase some folders <em>do</em> also carry OPML feed links for their contents as both this folder view shows:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFolderFeed.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFolderFeed.jpg" width="530" height="165" border="0" /></p>

<p>and it's correpsonding sub-bookshelf rack:</p>

<p><img alt="bblFolderFeed2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bblFolderFeed2.jpg" width="526" height="467" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'd quite like to see is a preview of the contents of each feed (something I believe may be on the way...).</p>

<p>In terms of design, the approach followed in Netvibes for previewing feeds may be reusable here. For example, here's a Netvibes feed title preview, along with a description (Journal abstract?) preview:</p>

<p><img alt="ieeeTitlePreview.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ieeeTitlePreview.jpg" width="331" height="204" border="0" /></p>

<p>Netvibes also lets you look at the whole description text in feedreader style panel:</p>

<p><img alt="ieeePostNV.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ieeePostNV.JPG" width="787" height="417" border="0" /></p>

<p>but I believe that the intention of the BlogBridge Library folks is not to move into feedreader territory, although feed previews are very much on their to do list.</p>

<p>Form a library point of view, wether than being able to click through from a  feed item link to a feed reader view of that item, it would be neat to be able to configure my view of the bookshelf to let me click straight through to the full text of a journal article via an inserted <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">libezproxy</a> link...</p>

<h3 class="title">Generic Library Lookup Greasmeonkey Script</h3>

<p>Okay, here's the first bit of my <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> long path <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007069.html">Library remote</a> competition entry: a Greasemonkey script that looks ISBNs in the URL of a loaded page and if it finds one it displays a draggable panel containing library lookup links.</p>

<p>The code is virtually all stolen - the library lookup bits I have been using for ages and can't remember where they came from originally.</p>

<p>The draggable stuff is from <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/RSSpanel/">RSS Panel</a> (where in turn it was reused from <a href="http://bookburro.org/">Vook Burro</a>. Hmm - looking at that script for the first time I can remember, it seems there's a lot of stuff that can be reused from there. Ho hum - nothing new under the sun...).</p>

<p>The regular expression used to pull out the ISBNs is a modified version of the one used in Udell's <a hre="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Library Lookup script</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few screen shots. The panel is draggable and originally launches in the top left hand corner of the screen.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Traveller (Library Remote) Script</h3>

<p>Time is a scarce resource,  which makes building a major piece of software for the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> difficult. Here then is one particular roadmap I hope to follow in assembling small standalone applications using small amounts of reusable code - I anticipate 30mins to 2 hours effort for each one. Each mini-app will provide useful functionality as a standalone item, but should also be capable of being integrated or aggregated with others items to provide a more comprehensive (integrated) tool suite. Providing separate scripts for each component: 1) allows for point testing of different functionality; 2) increases the number of "baby scripts" available for <em>other people</em> to build on or reuse (without them having to strip out other functionality).</p>

<p>As the purpose of the Library Mashup competition is to generate and promote new ways of working with library related components in a "Web 2.0 way", if anything takes your fancy in this series of postings please feel free to reuse any code snippets, interaction designs or functionality proposals in your own competition entries (though if you do create a winning entry that does incorporate ideas gleaned from these pages, I'd be happy to give you my Amazon wishlist details so you can tip me an a item or two from it;-)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you'd be willing to contribute coding effort, please let me know. As mentioned above, the roadmap is based on building a series of short scripts that can then be aggregated in a single application.</p>

<p>So then, here's the first roadmap. </p>

<p>A <em>library remote control</em> extension for Firefox (+Opera? +IE7?) that will identify pages with an ISBN in the page location (for example, the major booksellers) and automatically generate a pop-up panel on those pages that will offer the following functionality:</p>

<p>- a lookup of the ISBN number in the user's library catalogue for print holdings of that item; several GM scripts already exist that support this function. Reports should include whether the book is on the shelf, on loan, ordered, lost, not held, etc.</p>

<p>- the ability to reserve a book if it is held by the user's library;</p>

<p>- results should be displayed in a 1) floating, 2) draggable, 3)  closeable, 4) expandable panel (cf. the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/RSSpanel/">RSS Site Index Panel</a>.</p>

<p>- a lookup of ebook or scanned versions of items with that ISBN number; the provision of links to Google books, Amazon Look Inside copies etc. <em>if available</em>. The provision of libezproxied (or equivalent) links to ebooks available through the user's library catalogue; </p>

<p>- the provision of 1) a list of xISBN (and/or thingISBN) equivalents to the current book, and 2) links through to these: a) <em>on the same site</em>, (e..g on the bookseller's site) b) as a lookup on the user's Library catalogue, 3) <em>if</em> the books are available at these locations.</p>

<p>- a lookup of 1) the bookdata* for the given ISBN e.g. on isbndb(?) and 2) the use of this as the basis for a) a search on the library catalogue to find alternative versions of the book; b) for a 'suggest this book' recommendation to the library; c) of an interlibrary library loan application.</p>

<p>* it strikes me that rather than looking up books using all the xISBN variants, it would be better to lookup books on the basis of <em>author</em> and <em>title</em> if you just want to get help of a copy of a book irrespective of its edition?<br />
 <br />
(- in passing, enhance the OU library <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/book/bookrequest.php">recommend a book OU internal)</a> page by: 1) offering to autocomplete book details based on the provision by the user of an ISBN, followed by a call to a book info lookup service; 2) checking to see if a book being recommended is held by the library a) on the basis of ISBN alone, b) on the basis of book data (author, title), and then reportig back to the user. If the book is already held, offer the user the ability to reserve it.)</p>

<p>An extension package (or integration of the aggrgated scripts into a browser toolbar) that provides the complete set of functionality in a single package is the goal. The babysteps that I hope will get me there is a series of bookmarklets and Greasemonkey scripts (for Firefox initially) implementing each component separately. Some components will be stepping stone/proof of concept scripts that prototype/demonstrate how to achieve certain behaviours that can then be reused in later scripts.</p>

<p>So - may the journey begin...</p>

<h3 class="title">Online Bookshelves</h3>

<p>A new mailing list (<a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mailing-lists/ngc4lib/">NGC4Lib - Next Generation Catalogs for Libraries</a>) has just started up and already some intersting things are appearing on it. Take this bookshelf browser, for instance, at <a href="http://demo.gapines.org/opac/en-US/skin/default/xml/cnbrowse.xml?cn=j">Georgia Library (PINES)</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryShelfBrowser.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryShelfBrowser.jpg" width="664" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking on a book title gives a clear and informative record for it, as you might expect:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryPINESRecord.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryPINESRecord.jpg" width="659" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p>as well as a link to a bookshelf for the book author:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryShelfAuthor.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryShelfAuthor.jpg" width="588" height="503" border="0" /></p>

<p>This would be a really neat interface to the <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">Personal Bookshelf, I think.</a>. It would also be great interface to our Library's new stock (which is <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">available as a feed</a>).... or as an interface to my Amazon wishlist.</p>

<p>I've been looking for some reason to explore this really neat idea for <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2006/05/consuming-amazons-web-api-directly.html">Consuming Amazon's Web API Directly with Javascript (via JSON and XSLT)</a>, and maybe a wishlist bookshel is it?</p>

<p>Similar in feel is <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com">Blogbridge</a>, an online feed directory. The model seems to resemble the sorts of reading lists you might find at <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/home.do">H20 Playlist</a> or <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a>, although the focus at Blogbridge is solely on organising feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="blogbridgeMain.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/blogbridgeMain.jpg" width="543" height="480" border="0" /></p>

<p>Each topic has it's own page too, of course...</p>

<p><img alt="blogbridgeTopic.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/blogbridgeTopic.jpg" width="419" height="351" border="0" /></p>

<p>My first thought was that this would be one way of trying to organise/present/manage a directory of feeds that are starting to appear around the OU, as well as providing a suitable spot to host links to internal and external bloggers, but when the Blogbridge meme mixes withthe Library Bookshelf, another alternative presents itself...<br />
 <br />
For example, how about using the Blogbridge interface as a model for an online <em>Journal</em> bookshelf (i.e. an online <em>magazine rack</em>), where the  feed links to the table of contents, say, of a particular journal, and the screenshot is a picture of the journal cover.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways of doing this of course - a 'current titles' shelf, with a 'copy' of the most recent edition of each journal, or shelves dedicated to particular journals (i.e. containing an archive of a particular journal) and so on.</p>

<p>Direct linking to full text of articles for open access content would be easy enough to set up, butwWhat would be really handy would be if the feeds for subscription journals could also be set up to link through your local OpenURL resolver to subscription/full text versions of each article. </p>

<p>Would this qualify as a <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/competition">Library Mashup Competition</a> entry, I wonder?</p>

<h3 class="title">Finding DOIs</h3>

<p>I like the idea of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) a lot, and have written about them <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=%22digital%20object%22&amp;IncludeBlogs=1149">several times</a> but one thing that bothers me is that they're not always given for an article, even if they exist.</p>

<p>Take this <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=openurl+resolution">search on Google Scholar for <em>openurl+resolution</em></a>, for example. The first hit is given as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="gsSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gsSearch.jpg" border="0" height="221" width="722" /></p>

<p>Now, the results show that this article is available from several locations (<em>group of 7</em>), which may be handy; and if I want the full reference of any particular instance, I can have it, for example as a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:-D8HR5_q5SUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=citation&amp;oe=ASCII&amp;oi=citation">BibTeX record</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="bibtex.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/bibtex.jpg" border="0" height="151" width="767" /></p>

<p>But what I'd really like is a DOI listed in the results too...</p>

<p>At this point it's perhaps worth noting that Google Scholar knows how to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+doi%3A10.1045%2Fmarch2001-vandesompel&amp;btnG=Search">resolve DOIs from the search box</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="googleScholarDOIResolution.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleScholarDOIResolution.jpg" border="0" height="265" width="724" /></p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> have a <a href="http://www.crossref.org/guestquery/">free DOI lookup</a> service which looks like it might do the business:</p>

<p><img alt="crossRefDOILookup.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/crossRefDOILookup.jpg" border="0" height="383" width="623" /></p>

<p>So on my to do list then (unless Google beat me to it) is for starters a script that will take a BibTeX reference, chuck it into a CrossRef DOI lookup form, pull out the DOI (if there is one), and squirt it back into the Google results page...</p>

<p>PS I wonder - would it be handy to build a tool that also creates OpenURL and COinS data from the BibTeX info too? </p>

<p>For example, there's this <a href="http://generator.ocoins.info/">COinS Generator</a> which takes similar info and generates <a href="">COinS HTML snippets</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="coinsGenerator.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/coinsGenerator.jpg" width="608" height="566" border="0" /><br />
 <br />
And plenty of <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/sfx_openurl.htm">OpenURL</a> generators, like <a href="http://library.ucf.edu/Presentations/2004/OpenURLChoices/SFXpages/OpenURLGenerator.html">this one</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="openURLgenerator.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/openURLgenerator.jpg" width="617" height="522" border="0" /></p>

<p>PPS I really need to get my head around the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation-formats">wide variety of citation formats</a>.</p>

<p>PPPS <a href="http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/?p=60">this</a> looks interesting and worth tracking...:<br />
<blockquote>here are some thoughts on a way of meshing unAPI and COinS to enable interesting uses of bibliographic metadata in web pages</blockquote></p>

<h3 class="title">O'Reilly SafariU</h3>

<p>On Wednesday, we had a presentation from <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2427">CJ Rayhill</a>, CIO at O'Reilly's <a href="http://safariu.com">SafariU</a> 'self-service, text book on demand' website. Here are some lightly edited notes from the session...</p>

<p><em>How could O'Reilly help out in academic publishing?</em></p>

<p>Been around for 25 yrs, now a media company, not just a book publisher.<br />
As well as printed content, are O'Reilly are into <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">conferences</a> and developer communities (like <a href="http://www.onlamp.com">ONLamp.com</a> and <a href="http://xml.com/">XML.com</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://sarafiu.com">SafariU</a> is a free service to academia, providing free access to O'Reilly materials, mix and match contact, also in assocation with academic's own material, delivery in print or online. SafariU also includes a learning object exchange, plus shareable playlists.</p>

<p>SafariU driven by the idea that there must be a better way to deliver reference materials to students than high cost textbooks.</p>

<p>Consultation with users (academics?) suggests they desire:</p>

<p>- One stop shop<br />
- Mix and match<br />
- Upload own materials<br />
- Combine materials<br />
- Online or print<br />
- Share compilations</p>

<p>O'Reilly-<br />
Online library (safari books online 50% owned each O'Reilly and Pearson) - separate to O'Reilly<br />
<a href="http://www.bvdep.com/">Bureau van Dijk</a>, Belgium, host <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p>SafariU - went into beta 01/2005, redesigned from ground up following beta</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> XML server is the core component at heart of SafariU.</p>

<p>SafariU came out of beta 3/06 - <a href="http://www.safariu.com">www.safariu.com</a></p>

<p><em>Business model:</em> free to academics, but student body must consume a certain amount of material ($700 per year) over the course of a year. O'Reilly sell print-on-demand (POD) versions of textbooks to resellers (e.g. campus  bookshop) $0.16 per page (print); or online service (pay-per-time)).</p>

<p>If course uses e.g. material from several books and articles, with snippets of material provided by instructor, the student sees links to the full source books (presumabaly so they can then read/buy into those).</p>

<p>So the student pays to access the content...[hmm - in OU, we tend to provide the majority of third party content, e.g. course readers etc. as part of course, though there is a mixed model across OU wrt text books being bundled with course materials or student self-purchased.]</p>

<p>But there are also corporate payment/access mechanisms (?)</p>

<p><a href="http://safarix.com/">SafariX</a> (Pearson) - multi-subject, textbook only service; student access to online equivalent of textbook for 50% of print cost. <a href="http://www.netg.com/">Thomson NETg</a> appears to be another player in the area...</p>

<p>XML.com (and other O'Reilly web properties) etc. can be searched over from SafariU.</p>

<p>Within SafariU, academics bundle content in projects. 5 steps in building project:</p>

<p>- gather material<br />
- organise material (drag and drop interface, estimated page count, estimated cost to student)<br />
- print options (cover customisation, use own logos, binding options)<br />
- review (e.g. generate inspection PDF copy)  - can at this point go back to step 2,2;<br />
- reorder/reorganise material, index and contents will then be regenerated interactively<br />
order (generates ISBN)</p>

<p>Projects may be public or private (private for own use/own student use), public can be shared.</p>

<p>Looking to experiment with offline viewing options - e.g. socially motivated context (shareable annotations, comments)</p>

<p>Can't modify content (rights), but can write your own bridges. Can also import third party material if you clear rights and make it private.</p>

<p>In print version, each extracted section is branded at start of section wiith original source.</p>

<p>SafariU native (non-uploaded) content internally stored as XML [so we could get XML output...?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a> interested in the SafariU platform (not the content) so SafariU will be providing platform services for Autodesk...</p>

<p>[is there going to be an API?]</p>

<p>No e-commerce layer at the moment. But e.g. a trainer might have a private project, print copies of the book, and then resell them privately. [Hmmm, how does the copyright work there?]</p>

<p>Compilation is property of SafariU, but original content is retained by author. [So we wouldn't own the rights to any compilation we produced? Hmmm...]</p>

<p>User uploads of PDF only (to prevent users e.g. uploading powerpoint with animations etc.)</p>

<p>But - there will be links out to multimedia materials.</p>

<p>No repagination of uploaded material BUT repagination of the native (XML) SafariU content. (Some guidance to style provided.)</p>

<p>Generate dynamic table of contents and index; no bibliography generation(?).</p>

<p>Won't index uploaded PDFs (yet) or some of the old, originally uploaded Pearson content (which omitted index terms).</p>

<p>docbook format, <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">XML mind</a> editor used internally, future potential for contributor upload of XML as well as current PDF upload.</p>

<p>No limit on amount that can be taken from one book.<br />
Minimum print book order number 10<br />
min page count 100<br />
max page count 820</p>

<p>After one print run, and delivery of course, instructor can go back in and revise content, reprint etc [same book but different edition? would the book get a new ISBN that's viewable via xISBN for example?]</p>

<p>At tmoment, if original source material included in compilation were uploaded, the compiler does not get an alert, but this may be something for the future.</p>

<p>?What about errata? No notification/feed thru of errata to sites/collections where content is used - <em>yet</em>...</p>

<p><em>Online:</em> within a syllabus, content from up to 10 book titles.<br />
Able to see which students have logged in to the syllabus.</p>

<p>SafariU - just a content delivery mechanism - not a full LMS.</p>

<p>Students want an offline option - what that might be is being explored - e.g. options that support highlighting, annotation etc. Value added, not just PDF. </p>

<p>Untethered options (??), offline use is current priority.</p>

<p>SafariU environment can be customised (cf. Autodesk relationship), so O'Reilly could host an OU look and feel SafariU environment for the OU.</p>

<p>Exploring federated search options (but then there are likely to be copyright hassles with reusing third party material not contained in SafariU).<br />
 <br />
SafariU/books online cleared for international use.</p>

<p>??<a href="http://www.bookshare.org">bookshare.org</a> - they can get SafariU content. [?Bookshare? - hmm - "Bookshare.org dramatically increases the accessibility of books for people with visual or other print disabilities." Maybe something the OU should look at?]</p>

<p>O'Reilly likes bookshare.</p>

<p>Search underlying SafariU will be reused to search O'Reilly in general.</p>

<p>Possible to purchase rights to republish x copies of someone else's book, upload those into a private project and integrate them with SafariU materials.</p>

<p>SafariU is a self-service, interactive offering.</p>

<p>NH: OU way is not me as academic putting together a course; it's me as academic in a CT doing some things, but other stuff gets done by/control passes to other people.</p>

<p>Costs are scarey for OU (scaleable) use.</p>

<p>Potential for shared authentication between OU students authenticated into Moodle and across to SafariU (perhaps branded in OU way and provided as content page withing Moodle).</p>

<p>NH: How does OU business model change if we go down SafariU route (e.g. no need to purchase, warehouse and ship several thousand copies of a book over several years).</p>

<p>[??expensive to recruit students - could federated search into our content help with recruitment and contribute to a reduction in this cost?]<br />
[Could we guesstimate numbers of books required, get them printed and have them shipped to Amazon's MK warehouse???;-) Set-up some sort of just-in-time/just-after-order print model with despatch to Amazon for fulfillment when enough orders are in? What's the POD turnaround time?]</p>

<p>?OU going to move towards sourcing more and more comtent from outside.<br />
O'Reilly moving away from pure publishing more into a service for educators.</p>

<p>Small amount of OU Business School is produced as print-on-demand already.<br />
[<blockquote>The term "print on demand" within the publishing industry has become almost entirely linked to publishers needs for rapid production of single copies to fulfil single orders.  This is probably not a huge need for the University though Materials Procurement has been supplying the Business School with supplementary materials produced as print on demand.</blockquote>]</p>

<p>JC - 3 yr update cycle not sustaible.<br />
NH - you think it'll change in next 5 yrs...?</p>

<p>JC: shorter update cycle will happen<br />
NH: should - should happen...but it won't...not quickly...</p>

<p>O'Reilly talking to <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/solutions/itunes_u/">iTunesU</a> about potential collaboration. [Hmmm - something else to add to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006073.html">corporate academic computer services</a> mix!]</p>

<p>OU library - 15 concurrent users to Safari books online via Proquest [see: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006589.html">ISBN Safari lookup Greasmonkey script</a>], which doesn't suit the OU in terms of cost/concurrent users etc. (important for a university with 180, 000 online students).</p>

<p>Interesting model would be for course to provide online material, and give student freedom to select and pay for the 'send me a printed copy' version.</p>

<p>OU has deal with <a href="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/cases/cases_home.jhtml">Harvard Business School</a> press to gain 1-click access to HBS materials. [Hmm - couldn't find a particular reference to that in the Library - maybe just 'yet another e-collection'?]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oreillylearning.com/">Learning Lab</a> - online course product from O'Reilly???  Hands-on online environment for providing students access to virtual sys admin simulators etc. Covers programming languages, server admin, operating systems etc. [need to look at this...]</p>

<p>Current OU business model - e.g. course costings tool - just couldn't countenance using SafariU like methods.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://gilbane.com/case_studies/oreilly_case_study.html">O'Reilly SafariU case study</a></p>

<p>Safari Books online via Library still likely to be useful in addition to SafariU (though Safari online is v expensive and limited to 15(?) concurrent seats).</p>

<p>Two-dimensional view of publishing: free-premium content on one axis, atomised-packaged content on the other. Market would like free-atomised, textbooks traditionally premium-packaged.</p>

<p>However, textbook model does not necessarily reflect usage (e.g. read sections 2-3 of chapter one, and sections 4-7 of chapter 2 - most(!) people don't read textbooks like novels).</p>

<p>[A lot to think about here in terms of remodelling OU production and delivery processes...]</p>

<h3 class="title">O'Reilly Safari Lookup from Amazon Greasemonkey Script</h3>

<p>Another stopgap arising from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006569.html">Amazon wishlist/O'Reilly integration to do item</a> posted earlier today, here are a couple of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> scripts that do <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">Library lookup like</a> things for the <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari e-book bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safarilookup.user.js">Safari Lookup</a><br />
<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safarilookupOU.user.js">Safari Lookup (via OU libezproxy)</a></p>

<p>Here's the result of <em>both</em> scripts running at the same time (which means they'll also run alongside the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Amazon Library lookup script</a>). The advantage of the OU script is that if you have an OU SAMs authentication cookie set, you get to read the full text without the need to log in...</p>

<p><img alt="safariLookupGM.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/safariLookupGM.jpg" width="551" height="430" border="0" /></p>

<p>Looking at that screenshot, I think that a better place to put the link would be by the <em>Availability</em> information.</p>

<p>That's one more to do item, then (along with doing a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006280.html">Google books version</a> and integrating the xISBN functionality into the script (there's a crib available in the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</a>, so it shouldn't be too hard to do given a spare half hour or so...))</p>

<h3 class="title">O'Reilly Books Full Text from Amazon? Almost...</h3>

<p>This is just a placeholder post for a half hour (?) hack I don't have time to do just at the moment... <strong>Update:</strong>Safari/Amazon library lookup bookmarklets now added... </p>

<p>As O'Reilly are coming to the OU tomorrow (I think) [internal readers: email c.bailey for info] to talk about their <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Bookshelf</a> electronic book service  - which even has its own <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?mode=file&file=html/SafariLabs1">labs</a>! - and their <a href="http://safariu.oreilly.com/">SafariU build-you-own-textbook service</a> I wondered about how they reference their ebooks in a URL, and whether it was URL based.</p>

<p>Well, it is... though to see the book text you need a subscription (which we have via the library of course...): for example, <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId=0596102356">this book</a> (the 'free' page is <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId=0596102356">here</a>).</p>

<p>Now, you can also get hold of book ISBNs in an <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">Amazon wishlist feed</a> (I have one of these feeds driving  a Firefox live bookmark) which has given me the idea of a <em>live booklist</em>... </p>

<p>Take one <strong>Amazon wishlist feed</strong>, to which I post O'Reilly books that interest me (perhaps I could scrape the publisher info from the ISBN and use a mixed publisher wishlist?), add a dash of <strong>libezproxy</strong> (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">here</a>) and republish as an feed. Consume as a <strong>live bookmark</strong>.</p>

<p>The user model is then this: I see a Safari book I like on Amazon, I add it to my Amazon O'Reilly wishlist, and then can pick up the full text of the book via a link fed to a live bookmark in my browser...</p>

<p>PS I hadn't noticed this at first:<br />
<blockquote>Safari  is an e-reference library where you can search across thousands of books from O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley, Cisco Press, Microsoft Press and more. Read books cover to cover or flip directly to the section you need in seconds.</blockquote></p>

<p>You can also search within books, and even with code fragments contained in the books:</p>

<p><img alt="oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/oreeillySafariSearch.jpg" width="180" height="376" border="0" /></p>

<p>As it's lunchtime, here's a 5 minute hack/reversion of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Udell's library lookup bookmarklet scheme</a> - a 'public' <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://safari.oreilly.com/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari Library lookup</a> bookmarklet, and a libezproxified one: <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;location.href='http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/?XmlId='+isbn}">Safari (OU) Library lookup</a> bookmarklet.</p>

<p>I'll try and remember to add this to my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Amazon-Supported Library Services</h3>

<p>Whilst chatting to Gill Needham in the OU Library last week about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Library Amazon script</a>, and a  'gold plated service' <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005517.html">delivering library books direct to people's pigeon-holes</a>*, Gill mentioned in passing whether there was any opportunity in using the Amazon catalogue in place of our public facing library catalogue. I've been mulling this over tonight, and consdiered the flipside - what if we use the library catalogue as a front end to Amazon?</p>

<p>[*Apparently, the library provides library services to the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/loans/regstaff.html">OU regional offices/academics</a>, and also <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/al_services.html">ALs</a> (the latter via a <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/services/al_services.html#postal">postal loans service</a>. Many ALs are employed in their own local HEIs, of course, so they don't really need to call on the OU library for books (not least because the collection is rather small, and  - err, how to say this - a bit quirky ;-) (That said, we do have an impressive <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources.html">e-library collection</a>, which is also available to ALs (and registered students...)) Nevertheless, for regional staff at least, the opportunity is there to have books pulled of the shelf in Milton Keynes and shipped up to the regional office.]</p>

<p>The idea (of using a library catalogue as an Amazon interface) may well have merit, it seems, as this precedent from the <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey+libraries+and+Amazon.co.uk?opendocument">Surrey library service</a> demonstrates:</p>

<blockquote>You can now buy items from Amazon.co.uk though the library catalogue and help to support your local library service into the bargain!

<p>Every title listed in the libraries' online catalogue of more than 400,000 books now has a link to the Amazon.co.uk website. Many of the links in the catalogue lead straight to the relevant page on Amazon so if you find that the book you want isn't in stock at your local library, buying it is just a click away.</blockquote></p>

<p><img alt="surreyLibrary.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/surreyLibrary.jpg" width="418" height="484" border="0" /></p>

<p>(Here's the <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/comm/Press.nsf/99c17debf90c17f064256bc7005b99bd/9b18aa9e269bc0c680256f74005dd3f2?OpenDocument">press release</a> and here's a <a href="http://www.surreylibraries.org/cgi-bin/surrey.sh">link to the Surrey Libraries catalogue</a> if you want to try it out (an Amazon link is on each book's details page:-)</p>

<p>Now, there are several things that spin off the idea of using the library catalogue as a front end to the Amazon catalogue.</p>

<p>Firstly, we get a piece of the pie whenever someone buys a book by registering as an <a href="http://associates.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join/main.html/203-2691911-6099905">Amazon Associate</a>**.</p>

<p>[**I did raise this once, somewhere internal, with respect to the sale of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/about/setbooks/">set books</a> to students (there's a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006103.html">OUseful Amazon Greasemonkey script</a> for this page of course...;-) Apparently, that's not possible, because we<a href="http://www.booksellers.org.uk/ou/">play fair</a>.]</p>

<p>Secondly, the Library's in the fulfilment business, just like Amazon. If a user's needs can be satisifed more quickly, directly, and cheaply, by getting the book out of the library, why not get the book from the library?</p>

<p>Thirdly, there must be a cost associated with getting books either via inter-library loans or posting them up to regional staff. I don't know how the library decides whether to buy a book that has been requested as an inter-library loan (presumably one factor would be the likelihood of it ever being borrowed again?! a factor which might be reflected by the Amazon sales rank?) but if a decision is made to ILL it at a cost greater than the purchase price of the book***, then wouldn't it be sensible to suggest to the patron that they buy the book for themself on a budget code funded via Library internal transfer/rebate to their Faculty? Especially if the Library also took a cut as an Associate (hmm - this may breach the Associate agreement)? And double especially if the book then found itself onto the patron's <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelf</a> - which would of course be linked into the Library catalogue (and I suppose Amazon, too) via a Greasemonkey script;-)</p>

<p>[***this will come through the on the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">OUseful Feedburner feed</a> as a <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/feedthru">delicious feedthru</a> item, but  if you haven't moved your subscription to this blog there yet, here's a taste of what you're missing out on:<br />
<em><a href="http://www.wishlistbuddy.com">WIshlist Buddy</a>: A really neat little web app that lets you set a target price for your Amazon wishlist items. When Amazon discounts the price of the item to a level at or below your target price, it sends you an alert.</em>]</p>

<p>Fourthly, the Library would be able to satisfy more user requests (?hmm ;-) - at the very least, seeing what books people were going to Amazon for because the library couldn't satisfy them, might usefully inform the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/waltonhall/collections/collections_develop.html">Collections Development Policy</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, it would also be possible to call on the Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html">web service API</a> to give a list of links to other books that people who bought the book in question on Amazon also bought... One reason you might want to do this is to refer people to other books <em>in the library system</em> that are related the book currently under inspection. (Again, this would provide data to the collection development group).</p>

<p>And why use Amazon's 'people who bought...' data rather than our own 'people who borrowed this also borrowed that' data? Well, I seem to recall Paul Miller touched on this when he <a href="http://paulmiller.typepad.com/thinking_about_the_future/2006/04/the_open_univer.html">talked at the OU</a> - the long tail... given the size of the our library userbase, the populations are so small that it's quite likely that the data will give some very peculiar results indeed!</p>

<p>In contrast, the volume of purchases going through Amazon on even unpopular titles are likely to be statistically more robust, and hence more likely to result in sensible recommendations.)</p>

<p>It's also possible to imagine an architectural enforcement of a policy to use the Library catalogue as an Amazon gateway for users on campus - anyone trying to look up something on Amazon from the OU network could be redirected to the library catalogue, staff <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelves</a> or Club <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouclub/cdlibrary/">CD library</a> ;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Google Books Lookup Script</h3>

<p>As I slowly working through the set, here's a follow up to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">OU Library Amazon Greasemonkey Script</a> based on a direct reworking from a script by Edward Vielmetti (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a>) that does a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/02/inserting_libra.html">library lookup on books viewed in Google Books</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googlebooksOU.user.js">OU/Google Books Library Lookup Script </a></p>

<p>And here's an example lookup:</p>

<p><img alt="googleBooksLookup.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleBooksLookup.jpg" width="707" height="159" border="0" /></p>

<p>Just in passing, I heard from an internal reader this week who mentioned having actually got a book out of the OU library as a result of using the Amazon library lookup script:-)</p>

<p>It seems to me, the next thing to do would be to do a script to annotate somone's Amazon wishlist. </p>

<p>However, rather than doing this on an Amazon page, I'm tempted to create a bespoke page, or perhaps a feed, that will flag Wishlist items that are in the Library (or perhaps books that are on a <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk">bookshelf</a> somewhere (described briefly <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005948.html">here</a>...;-)</p>

<p>And the source of the wishlist info? Why, a <a href="http://www.edazzle.net/amazon/">Amazon wishlist feed</a>, of course!</p>

<h3 class="title">Talis Silkworm Library 2.0 Platform</h3>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> documentation for the Talis Platform<br />
 (Library 2.0) API is now starting to appear on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a> at <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/platform/">Talis Platform API</a>.</p>

<p>A week or so ago, a public draft of the Talis Community Licence appeared in <a href="http://iandavis.com/blog/2006/04/announcing-the-talis-community-licence">this blog post</a>.  <br />
 It came with the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>[This licence] is going to play a key role in [the Talis Silkworm] technology platform. It gives users and contributors of all kinds of platform data some fundamental rights with one important restriction. Basically it:

<p>    * Grants the freedom to use the data for any purpose<br />
    * Grants the freedom to modify and mix the data<br />
    * Grants the freedom to redistribute copies<br />
    * Prevents any attempt to deny those freedoms to others</p>

<p>We're expecting the Talis platform to manage and make available under this licence a huge variety of data ranging from MARC to RDF and everything in-between - that's 4 decades of data formats!</p>

<p>The licence has its roots in the GPL and includes the same sort of redistribution...</blockquote></p>

<p>I mailed this announcement to a select few, with the comment that it seemed to signal the imminent arrival of an open APIs to the <a href="http://silkworm.talis.com/">Silkworm platform</a>, something that had been hinted at when <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/">Paul Miller</a>, the Talis <em>technology evangelist</em> spoke at the OU <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Well - you'll be glad to know the first phase of the Talis Library 2.0 platform duly arrived in the form of the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ ">Silkworm directory</a> last week (blogged about <a href="http://informationtakesover.co.uk/archives/2006/04/27/talis-platform-silkworm/">here</a>).</p>

<p>A few of us had had a sneak preview (much appreciated, thanks) beforehand, which is partly why I've held off blogging about it - I'm a little guilty that I haven't found the time to knock up some sort of OU/Silkworm mashup (I was hoping to find an hour (that may have turned into four - you know how it goes!) to put something together, but other things are afoot at the moment that have got in the way of anything that might turn into open ended play time...)</p>

<p>Anyway, the first <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/">Silkworm Direcroty interface</a> is now open to play with, and I'm assured API details are on the way.</p>

<p>As some details are out now, and more due any time,  I think it's probably ok to pass on some of the details that Ian Davies originally mailed out:</p>

<blockquote>Technically the directory runs off an RDF store using Jena and Joseki, fronted by a thin web app written in ASP.NET and XSLT. The directory stores descriptions of collections, physical locations and electronic services. [e.g. here's a description of the <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql?query=describe+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdirectory.talis.com%2Fres%2Fdddconv-rlg1418%23self%3E">Open University collection</a>] We'll be introducing grouping of resources, descriptions of organisations and relationships between collections soon. The services are described in detail as RDF so we can programatically build queries into them.
...
There are a number of other RDF-based services .... Each primary resource in the directory
links to its RDF representation via a little blue icon beside its title. These point to our <a href="http://api.talis.com/1/dir/sparql">sparql endpoint</a>

<p>For the sparql service we plan on not allowing GRAPH/FROM queries<br />
either, certainly not from day one. As we scale the service out we might<br />
enable it.</p>

<p>We're using Joseki for the Sparql stuff. All the pages you see at http://directory.talis.com/ui/ are generated using XSLT on RDF/XML coming out of Joseki.</blockquote></p>

<p>Collection information is alo published as HTML as this page describing the <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/ViewService.aspx?id=http://directory.talis.com/res/dddconv-rlg1418-svc%23self">OU Library OPAC</a> demonstrates (the enabled search over the catalogue even works, too:-)</p>

<p>Some of the URLs look as if they are going to be hackable, generatable(?), which is handy. For example, this URL: <em>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/bib?title=rdf</em> is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We have a public service that uses the service information to automatically link into the OPAC. For example, on that page above you can see the generated identifier for Bath University is "ad9.sw". You can plug that into a URL like this and search for RDF.

<p>The [URL] syntax is a custom one based on what we know we can support for the majority of our service descriptions. It currently supports isbn, title and author parameters. Full documentation is coming :) We plan to support "real" protocols like SRU and OAI and map them to the  capabilities of the target OPAC. These will have URLs like:</p>

<p>http://api.talis.com/1/node/items/ad9.sw/sru</blockquote></p>

<p>An RDF returning search is also supported, taking the form <em>http://api.talis.com/1/dir/collections?api_key=?????&search=open</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormRDF.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormRDF.jpg" width="663" height="420" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how the library location lookup service can be used to augment the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/libraries/update/access_acdem.html">OU 'Libraries Near You' service</a> which provides an ugly interface to a 'library by postcode' lookup service augmented with information about lending rights for OU students, as well as library opening times and other administrative information.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Silkworm version goes for a Google maps mashup:</p>

<p><img alt="silkwormMap.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/silkwormMap.jpg" width="699" height="452" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment though, the OU data is far more reliable (and maintained). The Talis approach appears to be <a href="http://directory.talis.com/ui/GetInvolved.aspx">appealing to community support/maintenance of the library information database</a>, something the OU has done centrally (by phoning people up and hassling them, I guess!)</p>

<p>One thing I'm keen to explore is how we can work with Talis on maintaining this sort of information, and guaranteeing its correctness, for mutual benefit. (I should qualify that - I am 'outside the system' and so restricted to buolding proof of concept demonstrators that othe people would have to decide to adopt...)</p>

<p>If you want to keep up with what Talis are doing, I believe more announcements are due throughout May on the <a href="http://www.talis.com/tdn/">Talis Developer Network</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Code Search on BBC Programme Catalogue</h3>

<p>**It's back - the catalogue seems to have <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/">returned</a> ***</p>

<p>Last week, the BBC released  a beta (err, <em>experimental</em>!;-) version of its <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax">Programme Catalogue Search Tool</a>.</p>

<p>The search results don't link to downloads (yet?) but even so, the catalogue is still a fascinating resource. (There are other media archives, of course (e.g. I have bookmarked a few<a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/archive">here</a>), but some of them are subscription only (e.g. the <a href="http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/">British Universities Film and Video Council</a>), unlike the BBC offering, which is free).)</p>

<p>As well as providing a normal (human readable) web page of search results, machine readable XML (RDF, actually) results are also available, which makes for easy reuse of results.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried out one or two searches for the OU (using search terms 'Open University', OU, etc.). As well as the simple/basic search, I found the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/advanced_search">advanced search page</a> to be very useful.</p>

<p><img alt="BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" width="693" height="305" border="0" /></p>

<p>The most successful search turned up <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/OU">BBC catalogue search (series): OU</a>, which recorded several thousand entries over the last thirty years.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that a search can be made quite effectively for OU course programmes by course code. For example, here's a search for <em>S322</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322</a></p>

<p>That is, just use a query of the form:</p>

<p><em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:<strong>courseCode</strong></em></p>

<p>I haven't had time to check the OU library to see whether this information is available from any of their catalogues, but I suspect that it isn't(!). No matter  - the RDF feed from each catalogue entry page means that the information is available in a form that can be pulled easily enough into any other page if you know the catalogue entry number for a particular programme.</p>

<p>For example, here's a (human readable) catalogue entry page for a T209 programme:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>And here's the machine readable (XML/RDF)  result:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>The translation between the two is simple:</p>

<p>Web page: <em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>infax</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em><br />
RDF page:<em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>xml</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em></p>

<p>However, I haven't (yet) stumbled on a way of making a query to the catalogue that returns an XML response, which makes finding the results so they can be pulled into a page a little harder...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a plea to the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC Backstage</a> mailing list (backstage@lists.bbc.co.uk) turned up the answer:</p>

<blockquote>If you want to convert your web-based searches into REST-like requests, you want to pick out the "/infax/" in the url and change it to "/xml/" and "/feed/".</blockquote>

<p>So for example,  the atom/feed search:<br />
<a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who</a> works fine, as does <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209</a></p>

<p>(Just in passing, most of the results I looked at had a catalogue ID that included <em>OU</em> as the second and third characters. Does anyone happen to know what coding scheme was used to generate catalogue numbers?)</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful search</a> tool, I think when I allowed users to search for books/courses by keyword, the search was applied to book titles as well as course titles. I wonder how easy it would be to use the BBC catalogue info in the same way - for example, allowing users to make a general keyword search and then filtering on results that OU programming to identify courses by coursecode that are somehow keyed by a given keyword? </p>

<p>(Even in the BBC Catalogue Advanced Search, I couldn't find a way of combining arguments, e.g. to allow me to search on <em>title AND series</em>. Does anyone know if this is possible and if so, what the syntax is?) <em>Apparently, Boolean search is not supported at the moment..</em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Update</strong>: It seems as if the BBC Programme Catalogue has been taken down while it is in the 'review phase'....</p>

<h3 class="title">RefWorks from Google Scholar</h3>

<p>As a precursor to a review of Microsoft <a href="http://academic.live.com/">Live <em>Academic Search</em></a>, I thought I'd better just have a quick look at Google Scholar to remind myself of what it offered, and noticed this feature on the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_preferences">Scholar Preferences</a> page:</p>

<p><img alt="googleScholaRefWorksPref.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleScholaRefWorksPref.jpg" width="496" height="116" border="0" /></p>

<p>(As well as RefWorks, BibTeX, EndNote and RefMan are also supported.)</p>

<p>Why's this interesting? Well, <a href="http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a> is offered as a service to OU students via the OU Library (<a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/help/refworks.html">OU/RefWorks</a>).</p>

<p>Once you have set the reference export preference, an additional link is offered for each search result allowing you to imoport the reference directly into RefWorks:</p>

<p><img alt="googleScholaRefWorksLink.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleScholaRefWorksLink.jpg" width="649" height="237" border="0" /></p>

<p>Or should that be <em>almost directly</em>? I hadn't logged in to RefWorks for someitme, didn't have my password, couldn't get RefWorks to mail me a new one (or perhaps it did and email is taking an hour or two to get thrpugh tonight), eventually found my original RefWorks login info email, <em>still</em> couldn't work how to get in (perhaps it was in the Library documentation?), tried as a last resort to go in the group way, and Bingo!:</p>

<p><img alt="refworksGroupLogin.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/refworksGroupLogin.jpg" width="617" height="321" border="0" /></p>

<p>I have to go in via the OU group...</p>

<p>Anyway - once that hurdle was negotiated (my live OU SAMS authentication ticket seemed to automatically log me in to my personal RefWorks account) the reference was imported very easily:</p>

<p><img alt="refworksImport.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/refworksImport.jpg" width="692" height="539" border="0" /></p>

<p>Once in my reference list, my RefWorks account seems set up to try and provide seemless access to an electronic copy of each reference via the OU OpenURL link resolver:</p>

<p><img alt="refWorksReferenceList.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/refWorksReferenceList.jpg" width="711" height="364" border="0" /></p>

<p>It is possible to get an OpenURL linkresolver link embedded directly in the Google Scholar results page using a Greaseminkey script or suitable toolbar, of course, but that's the subject of another post...</p>

<h3 class="title">Improved OU Library Lookup Greasemonkey Script</h3>

<p>Last weekend, I stumbled across a <a href="http://silkworm.talis.com/examples/index.html">Talis Silkworm Greasemonkey script</a> which offered a nice way of inlining results (in Firefox only, of course) for various ISBN lookup and linking services (the script automatically creates links to Amazon, xISBN and so on). If you haven't see the effect of running this sort of script before, they also have a screencast showing their script in action.</p>

<p>Anyway, I couldn't resist tweaking the script so that it was locally OUseful, so here it is: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/isbnEnrichment.user.js">OUseful ISBN enrichment Greasemonkey script</a>.</p>

<p>And here's what it'll do to an ISBN in a web page. Firstky, it'll find ISBN numbers, highlight them, and  add a 'window open' button:</p>

<p><img alt="isbnAugmentLink.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/isbnAugmentLink.jpg" width="561" height="200" border="0" /></p>

<p>When you click on the '+' sign, the ISBN will be used to pull a book cover down from Amazon, the ISBN will be passed to the xISBN service to see if there are alternative versions of the book (with different ISBN numbers) available, and all related ISBNs will be used to seed links to the OU library catalogue, the OU library ebook subscription catalogue and, and the Google and Amazon look inside services.</p>

<p><img alt="isbnAugmentView.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/isbnAugmentView.jpg" width="797" height="524" border="0" /></p>

<p>Note that at the moment, the links that are generated are done so without heed as to whether or not the book in in the OU library, the book is available for search/look inside at Amazon or Google, the the book is subscribed to in ebook form.</p>

<p>A fully working version of the script would therefore:  </p>

<p>1) display whether or not the book is in the OU library (e.g. akin to the functionality provided by this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html">Amazon/OU library lookup script</a>);</p>

<p>2) display a link to the ebook directly, if it exists. An XML based search response should be easy enough to knock up, if this <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/ebookresult.php?search_term=intelligent+systems&search_field=title">query  for e-books</a> is anything to go by. (Searching for ebooks via the custom <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/ebooks.html">ebook search form</a> is certainly a lot easier than going via the Voyager catalogue.</p>

<p>3) Only display the look inside links if the book is available under that service.</p>

<p>As more and more web services come online, particularly via RESTful means (I'm guessing OpenSearch in IE will help drive this) the potential for client side web service orchestration can only get richer.</p>

<p>Just a couple of other things to note here - the above screens come from the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/about/setbooks/">Set books for Open University Courses</a> pages (a service not totally dissimilar to my aging and unmaintained <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/bookSearch.php">OUseful course book search</a> service.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things worth remarking on about that page. Firstly, it's not maintained by the OU library, nor is the information provided by the OU library. (In fact, it's quite difficult getting <em>just</em> course book information out of the Voyager catalogue in an easy way (if at all), something that I believe is being looked at at the moment). Secondly, all the course book information is provided on a single monolithic page, with a drop down list but no search box to find the book information for a particular course - even with my limited talents, I'd love to have a go at redesigning this page just using CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript so the displayed area fits on a single screen with no scrolling. It'd be a really nice theme for a simple AJAX exercise too;-)</p>

<p>To that extent (AJAXifying the page) I whether the database that was used to generate the cocourse books info page is the one that feeds the course book information into the courses web pages (as reviewed in this post: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005988.html">OU Course Catalogue Takes Lead from Amazon?</a>) and whether the information (and perhaps ebook links) are also fed into student's personal course pages? (Does ROUTES have links for ebook version of course books where avaialble, I wonder? I suspect not...).</p>

<p>Making course book information available in machine readable form through a simple URL directly (as well as via various simple URL based searches) would be a very handy way of transporting course book information around the OU and may also lead to interesting ways of using that info.</p>

<p>I guess I should look again at the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/webService.php">OUseful Books Webservice</a> to explore that area a little more.</p>

<p>PS The Talis script didn't work for me at first because it used the apparently broken <em>onclick</em> event statement. The fix was easy enough though: replace the <em>expander.onclick=doExpander;</em> assignment in the original<br />
with <em>expander.addEventListener("click", doExpander, true);</em><br />

<h3 class="title">Greasemonkey DOI Linkifier Script(s)</h3>

<p>As promised <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003940.html">some time ago</a>, here a few variations on the theme of a <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> Linkify script.</p>

<p>First off, a straightforward <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkifyDOI.user.js">DOI linkify script</a> that looks for <em>doi:XXX...XXX</em> keyed items on a page, and replaces them with <strong>&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/<em>doi:XXX...XXX</em>"&gt;<em>doi:XXX...XXX</em>&lt;/a&gt;</strong></p>

<p>Secondly, a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkifyDOIprotocol.user.js">doi: protocol linkify script</a> that uses the doi: items directly within the anchor: <strong>&lt;a href="<em>doi:XXX...XXX</em>"&gt;<em>doi:XXX...XXX</em>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>. For this to work, you need to register the <em>doi:</em> protocol with the browser, for example by using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon.php?id=718">DOI protocol handler extension</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, a version of the script that uses the OU link resolver and our libezproxy serviced (as mentioned <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005952.html">here</a>): <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/linkifyDOI-OU.user.js">OU libezproxied DOI  linkifier</a>. This appends the doi: to the link <em>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=</em></p>

<p>If you want to try the scripts out, try this: doi:10.1016/S0040-1625(03)00072-6</p>

<p>PS the scripts are all just a mininal revision of the 'standard' linkify script that can be found <a href="http://ftp.scarlet.be/pub/mozdev/greasemonkey/linkify.user.js">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">ISBN Playground</h3>

<p>It's amazing what you can do with ISBN numbers, isn't it?</p>

<p>For example, I've just posted a link generator at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ISBNLinks.html">http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ISBNLinks.html</a><br />
</a> which pulls together some of the 'ISBN as a URL argument' links I've found over the last few months.</p>

<p><img alt="isbnDoodling.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/isbnDoodling.jpg" width="358" height="499" border="0" /></p>

<p>The list includes links to Amazon (book pages and 'search inside' pages), Google books, OCLC xISBN and reader level services, ISBNdb book info, the OU library catalogue (of course;-) as well as book covers from Amazon (err, I think I break the regs on these - I suspect the images should link to the corresponding sales page on Amazon...)</p>

<h3 class="title">Opera Widgets</h3>

<p>Although I have way too many course writing things to do at the mo, I have managed to wangle a day a week doing things for the Library for 3 months or so, which should be a lot of fun:-)</p>

<p>The job spec is still not totally sorted, but I'm hoping that one payoff will be that I get to promote some of my library related doodles to people who might actually be able to sponsor their use in some way (not that anything I've produced is production stable, of course!) as well as gaining a bit more inside knowledge about the Library's systems (I would <em>love</em> to be able to doodle with an XML front end to the library catalogue, for example...).</p>

<p>Anyway - one thing that has been mooted as something that I might mull over is <em>My Pocket Library</em>, a version of the library website, I guess, that's appropriate for viewing on mobile devices....which is one area I'm way out of my depth in, of course!</p>

<p>Never having got around to building anything in <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp">J2ME</a>, about the only mobile thing I've ever doodled with are a couple of WAP sites built years ago when I was chasing a <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo">microinfo/microcontent</a> vibe (one site was a proof of concept/demonstrator for <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tel/cor/t396/wap/index.html"></a>, another for the <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/TSCPwap.html">Technology Short Course/Relevant Knowledge programme</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, the idea behind My Pocket Library may just be mobile appropriate content/navigation/styling, of course, or it may be more ambitious/application oriented - in which case, serendipity perhaps smiled on me today when I picked up on <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/dev/widgets/">Opera widgets</a> (I don't know where from...?!).</p>

<p>These are very much in the flavour of Yahoo/Konfabulator or Mac Dashboard widgets, Google gadgets(? or is it Microsoft gadgets? I forget now...!) which I skirted around some time ago (e.g. with a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004185.html">course news widget</a>), only this time requiring a (still beta) recent version of Opera.</p>

<p>From the odd mobile devices I've seen, Opera seems to be a reasonably widely used mobile browsing platform (also see <a href="http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2006/03/mobile_web_20_a_2.html">Mobile Web 2.0</a> and <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008953.html">Opera mini</a>, and, even better, this <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/platform/">Opera AJAX Platform/toolkit</a>), so it may be worth trying to doodle a widget or too (by pillaging the  <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/customize/widgets/">Opera widget gallery</a> probably!) to consume some library services.</p>

<p>There's a secondary payoff too in that any widgets would also run on the desktop Opera browser, which may be interesting if it were installed on some of the public access machines in the library...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Amazon Greasemonkey Script</h3>

<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/">Paul Miller</a> from Talis gave an 'Intro to Library 2.0' talk in the Library (blogged in part by <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/?p=377">Marc</a> during the talk; I have some notes, too, that I will pop up later).</p>

<p>During the talk, Paul mentioned the use of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> scripts for inserting library catalogue info into Amazon web pages (like <a href="http://www.mundell.org/2005/12/08/amazon-seattle-public-library-lookup-greasemonkey-script-updated/">this</a> or <a href="http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/60/">this</a>. I thought I'd posted an OU version of this script, but apparently not. (I do have a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">library lookup</a> button on my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005845.html">OU Library Firefox toolbar</a> though, which does something similar, albeit it ina more clunky way (i.e. a way that requires a postive user action, specifically clicking the Library lookup button). </p>

<p><img src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbar1_3.JPG" alt="OU Library Firefox toolbar" /></p>

<p>Anyway - the Greasemonkey script hinted at above is easy enough to hack around, so here's a first pass (I'm not sure it's fully debugged yet, e.g. for books being catalogued or on order):  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouLibLookup.user.js">Amazon UK OU Library Linky</a>. (To use it, you'll need Greasemonkey installed on Firefox).</p>

<p>Here are few examples of what it does:</p>

<p>A book that can be found in the OU library:</p>

<p><img alt="amazonOULinky1.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonOULinky1.JPG" width="638" height="118" border="0" /></p>

<p><br />
A book that can be found in several versions in the library (e.g. on the shelf and inelectronic format):</p>

<p><img alt="amazonOULinky.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonOULinky.JPG" width="555" height="323" border="0" /></p>

<p><br />
A book that is currently on loan from the library:</p>

<p><img alt="amazonOULinky2.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonOULinky2.JPG" width="511" height="155" border="0" /></p>

<p><br />
A book available in electronic format in the library (I guess we could link directly to the ezproxied version here?):</p>

<p><img alt="amazonOULinky3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonOULinky3.JPG" width="680" height="222" border="0" /></p>

<p><br />
Not found in the OU library:</p>

<p><img alt="amazonOULinky4.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonOULinky4.JPG" width="492" height="91" border="0" /></p>

<p>In fact, this book is in the library under a different ISBN - maybe worth using <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/xisbn/">xISBN</a> (I think <s>Dave Pattern at Huddersfield has done this? or perhaps it was</s> <an href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/01/30.html">Jon Udell</a> has done this, but I can't get his script to work...? For amazon.co.uk, Jon's script needs at least the origTitle regexp tweaking, and I also had to tweak the ISBN regexp. It still failed to work though and I don't have any more more time to spend on it just now:-(</p>

<p><br />
PS If you prefer, here is an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouLibLookupBranded.user.js">OU branded script</a>:</p>

<h3 class="title">Commercial Advantages in DOI Resolution?</h3>

<p>Walking the dog just now, I was pondering the extent to which linking to a resource via a digital object identifier (<a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>) could be regarded as a persistent search.</p>

<p>A normal link - <i>&lt;a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog"&gt;OUseful blog&lt;/a&gt;</i> - isn't really a search of course (unless you consider domain name resolution or URL rewriting some sort of search) so why should something like <a href="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond">doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond</a> be regarded as search? (The lookup is achieved using the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005952.html">OU LinkfinderPlus resolver</a>.)</p>

<p>Well, the DOI resolver - which maps a DOI onto an electronic resource - makes the link between a persistent DOI and a potentially transitory location for the resource. Now I'm not clear about the actual mapping between a DOI and a resource, but from the way I've seen them (ab)used(?), DOIs seem to act a bit like an ISBN in the sense that  a particular journal article, say, may have different DOIs according to which database it is on (cf. different ISBNs for hard and soft cover books); and the same DOI may also point to different archived copies of a particular document (for example, different shelf copies of a book with the same ISBN).</p>

<p>That is, my understanding is that a DOI can have a one-to-many relationship with the different locations a particular article might be retrieved from; and there may also be a many-one-relationship between several DOIs and a particular article.</p>

<p>(If anyone can clarify this for me before I read the specs, comments will be open for a day or two from the <a href='http://http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog'>OUseful Blog homepage</a> page;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, what struck me was that if this is indeed the case then the resolver is potentially searching several sources when provided a DOI, with the intention of sending the user to one of them, or returning one of the resource instantiations back to the user.</p>

<p>So for the case of one DOI pointing to many potential retrieval locations, how does the resolver decide which to return?</p>

<p>Isn't there potentially a commercial advantage here for the service location that is preferentially returned?</p>

<p>I need to go and read the specs I think...</p>

<h3 class="title">DOI - Dead On Implementation?</h3>

<p>Last week I tried to demo some DOI (digital object identifier) links as a possible way of avoiding link rot in course materials over time, but had the demo fail becasue the link resolver at ny intended target (IEEE Xplore) appeared to be down.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to try some things out building on the various URL combinations that effectively pipe one web site via another described <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005952.html">here</a> and what fdo I get?</p>

<p><img alt="doiNot.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/doiNot.JPG" width="668" height="337" border="0" /></p>

<p>Harrumph - and you know what the really irritating thing is, I don;t have the full references to the things I wanted to try to link to, only their DOIs...</p>

<p>If DOIs are going to work, the resolver needs to be up 5 9s... (or perhaps dx.doi.org is not supposed to be a guaranteed service?)</p>

<p>[Seems it's a DNS issue... That said, the DOI folks are really helpful and suggested using <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/">http://hdl.handle.net/</a> in the interim.]</p>

<p>Something else that looks interesting - a forthcoming <a hrf"http://www.doi.org/tools.html">DOI resolution API</a> - this really will need to be reliable and always live...</p>

<h3 class="title">DOI and OpenURL Resolution</h3>

<p>One of the things that I keep coming back to in the area of technological support for elearning is how best to reference online resources in a persistent way.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I fired off a sanity checking email to <a href="http://libraryissues.blogspot.com/">Tim Wales</a>, the Technology Faculty liaison in the OU Library to see if this link pattern: <em>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/</em>whateverDOI worked in general for sites that were registered with the OU <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005864.html">ezproxy</a>, the idea being that the <em>ezproxy</em> would handle authentication with commercial database providers.</p>

<p>The thing that was concerning me was that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/">http://dx.doi.org/</a> resolves a DOI to another website, and I wasn't clear whether the libezproxy script would be happy with this.</p>

<p>Well, it does seem to work , but perhaps more interesting was the reply that Tim sent back. In particular, he made the very useful point that using the DOI would not necessarily result in a direct link to content in perpetuity for cases where the OU's subscription to the host of the particular article identfied by the DOI lapsed.</p>

<blockquote>[F]or article linking, I was tending towards considering
advocating the alternative method of using an OpenURL link with our
<a href="http://librarywiki.open.ac.uk/Wiki.jsp?page=LinkfinderPlus">Linkfinder+ resolver</a> [internal link] as it would automatically take users to an
alternative source of the document if one existed thanks to our multiple
subscriptions or present an alternative search options screen. With a
DOI link, if our subscription to the resource expired, the user would
have to know to look on our catalogue for other options or would think
they would have to buy it from the host site.</blockquote>

<p>Tim then went on, it seems, to hack a solution:</p>

<blockquote>The ideal would be to combine the two together and this facility does exist in Linkfinder+. I have just worked this out, this is the combi DOI
openurl link ... :

<p>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:<em>theDOI</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So - here's a rather neat recipe for: 1) resolving a DOI, 2) against the OU LinkFinder+/OpenURL resolver, and  3) accessing the article via <em>libezproxy</em>.</p>

<p>As an example, (if you're behind SAMS), Tim concludes:</p>

<blockquote>[Here's a link to a database we do subscribe to:] <a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1016/S0040-1625(03)00072-6">http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1016/S0040-1625(03)00072-6</a>

<p>This is an example of what happens with a DOI'd resource that we do not<br />
have access to with our current Linkfinder+ configuration:<br />
<a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1">http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1</a></p>

<p>You can see that the Publisher link does take the user to the resource in the end.</blockquote></p>

<p>One thing to note is that not all OpenURL resolved resources will necessarily require libezproxy access (err, is that right?)  - anyway, under that assumption, I have set up a OUseful shortcut - <a href="http://open.ac.uk/doi:">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/doi:</a> - which redirects to <em>http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?&id=doi:</em>, enabling LinkResolver resolution of doi queries.</p>

<p><br />
Just while I'm on the topic, here is an <a href="http://library11.open.ac.uk/linking/lfp.htm">OpenURL link generator</a>, and here is a link to the <a href="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display">OU Open URL resolver</a>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of official LinkResolver graphics, too: <img src="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/images/linkfinderplus.gif" alt="Check for Full Text graphic" /> and <img src="http://openurl.open.ac.uk/lfp/images/linkfinderplus2.gif" alt="Anoyther Check for Full Text graphic" /></p>

<p>For finding DOIs, here's a <a href="http://www.crossref.org/03libraries/37guest_query.html">DOI lookup service</a>, and here's a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/">DOI resolver</a> (and <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/">another DOI resolver</a>).</p>

<p>I guess the next thing to do is to get these things working with a <a href="http://curtis.med.yale.edu/dchud/resolvable/">COinS bookmarklet or Greasemonkey script</a>!<br />
 <br />
PS a couple of things that came to mind when trawling items for this post: 1) the same document (?terminology) may be available on several commercial databases, and each database will have it's own DOI for the document- is there an <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/xisbn/default.htm">xISBN</a> equivalent for DOIs (xDOI)? The LinkResolver+ I guess works by looking up the reference of the artcle referenced by a DOI, and then finding a database that the OU subscribes that serves that document - which is not really xDOI, though it has a similar effect. 2)  Using libezproxy results in URLs of the form <em>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/</em>, for example. Does this mean the OU is effectively republishing the <em>ieeexplore.ieee.org</em> site in this case, which is presumably a breach of copyright?</p>

<h3 class="title">My Bookshelf</h3>

<p>An interesting informal, internal project I found out about a week or two ago that sprang up out of a bet, so I believe (<em>"So Tom if you manage to setup a running system (technology + people) which captures over 50% of what is on the shelves in KMi and maintains this for at least 3 months I'll buy you a bottle of champagne (or equivalent other alcohol)"</em>) which provides a nicely rendered listing of the books in on your shelf given just their ISBN numbers.</p>

<p>The project is called <a href="http://bookshelf.open.ac.uk/">Bookshelf</a>, and the way it works is this:</p>

<blockquote>You provide a text file containing the ISBNs of books on your bookshelf. A PHP script then reads the text file, looks up each of the ISBNs using the Amazon.co.uk Web Services API, collects all the results and displays them together in one list. If you're using a recent browser like Firefox then some XSLT code transforms the XML from Amazon into XHTML to provide a human readable version.</blockquote>

<p>If you have OU intranet access you can see a <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=29&whichevent=628">presentation</a> all about it. </p>

<p>The guys who've been developing the Bookshelf (as an aside to their PhD work, apparently - amazing what a postgrad will do for a free drink!) are <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/tom/">Tom Heath</a> and <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/mark/">Mark Gaved</a> - their day job projects look equally interesting too.</p>

<p>A few days after seeing the demo,  another similar app crossed one of my in-feeds: <a href="http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/archives/001311.html">Delicious Library</a>. SImilar effect, but the execution seems a little more laboured to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, it'll be interesting to see how both of these progress...</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> it'd be neat if the chaps could work <a href="http://blog.mix06.com/virtualmix/archive/2006/03/15/Amazon.aspx">Amazon RSS wishlists</a> into the mix somehow, perhaps brokering who you might borrow books on your wishlist from, based on their bokshelf items?]</p>

<p>PS Just because, anyone interested in this sort of thing who hasn't already come across <a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> should probably go and check it out.</p>

<p>PPS Anyone know if there's anyone looking at a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">book info microformat</a>? [Here's some work on a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/cite">citation microformat</a> and here's the <a href="http://www.openurl.info/registry">OpenURL</a> inspired <a href="http://ocoins.info/cobgbook.html">CoINS book reference</a> description.]</p>

<h3 class="title">Search Hubs and Bounded Search</h3>

<p><a href="http://datamining.typepad.com">Matthew Hurst</a> has just written an interesting post about <a href="http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2006/03/strategic_idea_.html">Google's (lack of) GUI innovation</a>, which suggests that:</p>

<blockquote>Google doesn't own any other search interface innovations, so if they started using new ideas here, they would expose themselves to risk from every other search engine out there. There would be a feeding frenzy on the next UI brand. By keeping their interface simple, they force the competition to compete with their brand.</blockquote>

<p>I think there's something to this, but I also think that users like the simple life. For example, Yahoo keeps coming out with interesting innovations that don't seem to get widely adopted. A case in point? I was intrigued by <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/">Y!Q Contextual Search</a> when I first heard about it, installed the <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/publisher/firefox.html">Y!Q Firefox <s>toolbar</s> extension</a> etc. but do I use the functionality? Nahhhhhhh...it's easier just to use the search box on my browser toolbar. After all, that's where I usually go to search.</p>

<p>The area that has been particularly interesting me for a bit is <em>bounded search</em> - that is, search within a limited range of web pages or domains.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo.com</a> for example, where you can essentially define a search roll of sites to search. It's the sort of thing <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> could offer too, or any of the other 'lensing' sites like <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H20 Playlists</a>, but I don't think it/they does/do (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005493.html">here</a> for more).</p>

<p>In an attempt to clarify my thinking on this, I've started mulling over the phrase <em>search hub</em> (rather than <em>searchroll</em> for example) to see what it suggests to me (one of my favourite brainstorming techniques is to invent a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:neologism">neologism</a> and then unpack it/see what it suggests or brings to mind).</p>

<p>So for example, in a variety of recent doodles, such as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deliSearch.html">deliSearch</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005899.html">Search Pagelinks</a>, I've considered using a feed of delicious bookmarks, or the links on a page, as the set of resources over which a search should be applied (I guess <em>search set</em> or, recalling the above, <em>search lens</em>, could also be used instead of <em>search hub</em>?)</p>

<p>(Hmm - I'm also reminded of the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/popupLinks.html">popup linkset</a>(?) script, (effect described <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">here</a>), and the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/searchLink.html">searchLink</a> code, both of which I really need to get working ptoperly, tidy up, sort out the styling etc., and make useable... )</p>

<p>What's the point? Well, I'm working on it. Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be doodling some elearning activities that make use of <em>search hubs</em> or whatever they end up being called, both faculty and student created - and posting related thoughts to the OUseful blog, of course - so if anybody out there is working on/using something similar, please email me.</p>

<p>One of the useful facilities offered by the OU library is the ability to log in to a wide variety of subscription based services (databases and journal collections, for example) via the OU common authentication system.<br /><br />This is achieved at the OU by defining links of the form: <br /><br /><i>http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://whatever.service.you/want/to/get/access.to</i><br /> <br />presumably usinga variant of <a href="http://www.usefulutilities.com/">Useful Utilities' ezproxy script</a>, which allows the Library to define all sorts of <a href="http://www.usefulutilities.com/support/rewrite.html">rewriting rules</a> to log the user into the desired system.<br /><br />partly because it's Friday lunchtime, I thought I'd spend a minute or two knocking up a bookmarklet that will  - sometimes - log me in to a site requiring authentication <a href="javascript:void(h='http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=');void(h+=location.href);window.location=h;">via OU libezproxy</a>. (&lt;- That's it, just there, the bookmarklet; just drag it onto your bookmark toolbar, and when you click on it it will try and log you int to the current page via the OU's libezprxoy service.)<br /><br />If you're interested in writing your own, all it does is this: <em>javascript:void(h='http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=');void(h+=location.href);window.location=h;</em>).<br /><br />Now sometimes it work, sometimes it doesn't. If you have an OU SAMS ID, or even better - if you're already logged in to the OU via SAMS - have a look <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00043702">here</a> and see what happens to the subscription status of the journal issues when you click on the bookmarklet. </p>

<h3 class="title">Voyager Library Catalogue Toolbar</h3>

<p>Having worked out how to include an Options/Preferences dialogue in a Firefox extension (I'll post a tutorial if I get a chance), I've updated the OUseful OU Library toolbar for Firefox so that a user can now store their Library card details and click through&nbsp; to their Library record with a single click from the toolbar.</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarOptions1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarOptions1_3.JPG" width="217" height="409" border="0" /></p>

<p>I've also changed the look of the toolbar back to all text buttons, rather than images. </p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbar1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbar1_3.JPG" width="761" height="32" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is in part taking a lead from the Library official library website, which has been redesigned to be more in keeping with out current brand guidelines and which has&nbsp; dropped the large yellow icon used previously to identify the <em>Librarian On Call</em> instant messaging service.</p>

<p>The <em>Library Lookup</em> uses a version of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookupGenerator.html">Udell's library lookup bookmarklet</a> to extract an ISBN number from the URL of a currently loaded page (for example, an Amazon book page) and search the OU Voyager library for that book.</p>

<p>I believe that another OU Library front page redesign is on the cards, so it maybe worth my time doodling a few thoughts about how it may be improved here, just in case anyone from the library happens to subscribe to the OUseful feed!;-)</p>

<p>(If you haven't see the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk">OU Library homepage</a>, check out the link. In my opinion, it's a bit cluttered? The first thing I think I'd do would be to make the most of any currently set authentication cookies (which identify my role - staff, student etc.) and only offer me links that are relevant on the front page.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the topic of my unofficial toolbar, several shortcuts are provided via a dropdown list to OU Library related webpages. I'm still not sure what should go on this list:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarLinks1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarLinks1_3.JPG" width="154" height="169" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Searches menu allows you to make a search using a selected collection/index. The Voyager button also forces a search using the term(s) in the search text vbox, on the OU <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk">Voyager Library catalogue</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarSearchButtons1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarSearchButtons1_3.JPG" width="378" height="82" border="0" /></p>

<p>The user customisation dialogue:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarConfig1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarConfig1_3.JPG" width="603" height="191" border="0" /></p>

<p>enables an automatic login to <em>My Library Record</em> without the user having to manually fill in the required <a href='http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=pbLogon'>login form</a> (the button completes and submits the form automatically).</p>

<p><img alt="libraryToolbarMyButtons1_3.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryToolbarMyButtons1_3.JPG" width="202" height="33" border="0" /></p>

<p>The <em>My Open Library</em> link makes use of the OU's common SAMS authentication scheme to take the user to the correct My Open Library page.</p>

<p>If you want to try out the extension, you can install it from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.13.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.13.xpi');return false;">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next on the to do list for the toolbar are a couple more personalisation tools which will allow a user to add links to an additional library website - most OU students make use of an academic library near to them for book loans, and the OU library for access to online collections, ebooks etc. A couple of switches would allow this address to be used as the primary address for a library catalogue search or <em>Library Lookup</em>.</p>

<p>(If you are an OU student, and you do try out the toolbar, please get in touch and let me know what you think about it - for good or bad...)</p>

<p>This additional customisation will also pave the way for a generic library toolbar which will allow the user to configure the toolbar for use with their own Library system. </p>

<p>What I'm thinking off at the moment are options to: define 3 or four links in the dropdown links menu; customise two drop down search options, the primary library catalogue search button and the target for the <em>Library Lookup</em>; customise the <i>Librarian On Call</i> contact button; customise the My Library Record Link (this may depend on the particular catalogue system). The <i>My Open Library</i> button would go.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in trying out a customised version for your own library, please email me with details of the links/services you'd like included - especially if they differ markedly from my generalisation/customisation thoughts above - and I'll see what I can do in terms of getting a customised toolbar to you (feel free to hack the extension code yourself, of course - but please let me know if you do:-). This information will also help me work out just what to put into a generic, user customised toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: laterst version is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi">OU Library 1.3.1</a>; install it from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.131.xpi');return false;">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">Should Academic Libraries Map Institutional Social Networks?</h3>

<p>An interesting post - <a href="http://www.elsua.net/2006/02/17/ibm-untangling-office-connections/">IBM: Untangling Office Connections</a> - from a blog I've only just subscribed to (<a href="http://www.elsua.net/">ELSUA~A KM Blog</a> - "A blog about Knowledge Management, Communities of Practice, Collaboration, Social Networking and Work/Life Balance") on the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Network_Analysis">social network analysis</a> in identifying the informal networks that allow an organisation to work.<br /><br />(Who was it told me that the aftershock of an institutional reorganisation can take a year or to subside until the informal networks are working again..?!)<br /><br /><br />Anyway - I was wondering - whose role is it in an organisation to keep tabs on the knowledge flows/pathways (at least the formal ones), and where would I expect to go to find a map of those pathways? The communications department, perhaps? Or the <i>library</i>? As for mapping the informal pathways - perhaps that's too much to ask... although the bloggers may provide an entry point?<br /><br />PS here's a chart of the formal OU communications channels I was aware of a year or so ago (hmmm - the alignment of the various objects appears to be broken...):<br /> <br /><img alt="OUcomms.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUcomms.jpg" border="0" height="331" width="608" /><br /><br /><br />Looking at it, there's a couple of things I notice are missing&nbsp; - such as the intranet noticeboard and the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/oulifescreensaver/">OU screensaver</a>. Time for a revision perhaps..?<br /></p>

<h3 class="title">Searchrolls and Searchlists</h3>

<p>I was hoping to spend a little time tonight putting together a JSON-with-callback powered search page (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005679.html">background and links here</a>) but it seems I can't the RSS2JSON feed to provide me with a JSON object:-( </p>

<p>As I don't have access to a permanent server when I'm not in work, (which means I can't pop up an RSS2JSON server of my own) this means I'm stuck...</p>

<p>And it means I can't provide you with a link to my searchroll/search lists demonstrator.</p>

<p>(You may guess though that the search roll is a list of URLs or sites that act as the focus for a search, and can be maintained via an RSS feed.)</p>

<p>One application area I can see for search lists is in constrained search activities for info skills development, where students are provided with a  search list to search over, and they thus get to test their keyowrd/search term selection skills over a set of resources chosen by the instructor.</p>

<p>Thiis set of resources (the searchlist) may contain just high quality sources, or it may also contain low quality or irrelevant info sources that contaminate the resaults and help the student tune their search strategy.</p>

<p>Search Lists also potentially add value to recommended reading lists by allwoing the user to search within preselected texts in an effortless way.</p>

<p>NB when I realised that the RSS2JSON service wasnlt working for me, I did consider popping over to <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a>, not to see if they had an RSS2JSON server but to see if I could build the system server side using off-the-peg Ning RSS components. </p>

<p>However, at first glance, it appeared there was nothing that looked immediately relevant, which got me thinking about a wishlist for Ning features. </p>

<p>Here's a few of them:</p>

<p>- simple to use RSS components;<br />
- <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch</a> components (reminded me of <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/03/28.html">this</a> for some reason);<br />
- components for linking into Library services - Z39.50 handler/wrappers perhaps? Or <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/sfx_openurl.htm">OpenURL constructors</a>? 'cos it's taking libraries <em>forever</em> to open up their information to web 2.0... and with a few little tools in Ning, it'd make it much easier to assemble services...(Btw, is there a public directory of public SOAP or RESTful library services I can play with? Shame <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/z3950.html">this appeared to stall</a>);<br />
- rss aggregator tools, for mixing results from different feeds, clearing out redundant links etc.;<br />
- a mash creator tool - Ning has apps that wrap APIs to Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay etc., but I didnlt see a mash-app creator that lets you click two or three check boxes (say, Yahoo and Amazon) and then loads inthenecessary code libraries for you...</p>

<p>It's the simple tools I want, little things that do little things but that work together to allow you to do loads...</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Toolbar Redux</h3>

<p>Having tried to demo my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library Firefox Toolbar</a>the other day, only to find that it couldn't be installed in Firefox 1.5, I've made the necessary tweaks and uploaded a version that should work... You can install it from <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.11.xpi" onclick="InstallTrigger.startSoftwareUpdate('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.11.xpi');return false;">here</a>.</p>

<p>And just in case you need a reminder, here's what it looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="OULibraryToolbar.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OULibraryToolbar.JPG" width="759" height="41" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Library Lookup is, of course, <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Udell's</a> - if there's a URL in the browser URL address line, as for example when looking at a book on Amazon:</p>

<p><img alt="amazonBook.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/amazonBook.JPG" width="694" height="443" border="0" /></p>

<p>...you can just click on the Library lookup button and that book will be looked up in the OU library catalogue:</p>

<p><img alt="libraryLookedup.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/libraryLookedup.JPG" width="926" height="539" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are a few quick links in the toolbar too:</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library Record Bookmarklet</h3>

<p>Having taken the afternoon off, I felt like a bit of guilt free play, so I had a tinker with a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myLibraryRecord.html">Library Record bookmarklet generator</a> (Firefox only?) that creates a bookmarklet that will take you straight to your OU library record:</p>

<p><img alt="ouLibraryRecordBookmarkletGenerator.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouLibraryRecordBookmarkletGenerator.JPG" width="619" height="385" border="0" /></p>

<p>From the screenshot, you'll also notice that the app will also generate a link to an RSS feed that lists a user's current loans from the library (described previously <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005227.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've just modded the generator so that it can - possibly - generate bookmarklets for other Voyager library catalogues:</p>

<p><img alt="otherLibraries.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/otherLibraries.JPG" width="614" height="298" border="0" /></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myLibraryRecord.html">generator</a> now also generates a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">LibraryLookup bookmarklet</a>, along with the My Library Record bookmarklet.</p>

<h3 class="title">Distributing Bespoke Browsers</h3>

<p>In a recent post <a title="Lorcan Dempsey's weblog: Distance from the default: Web browser extensions" href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000924.html">Distance from the default: Web browser extensions</a>, Lorcan Dempsey wonders about what detrimental effects on the uptake of additional functionality in a browser etc. result from the effort needed to install the extension.</p>

<p>I'd actually mashed this thought with another - the usability of bespoke interface devices for high performance tasks - in a potential post I'd been doodling offline a couple of days ago...</p>

<p>So given the apparent synchronicity, here's that doodle...</p>

<p><h3>Is There a Place for a Library Equivalent of the Flock Browser</h3></p>

<p>In October last year, following weeks of hype and speculation, the <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock browser</a>  a major reworking of Firefox customised to support social networking activities such as blogging and social bookmarking  was launched to limited success. In this post, I'd like to explore whether there is the potential for a customised browser for use on public access terminals in libraries across the world?</p>

<p>Many have argued that the functionality offered by Flock is available to users of Firefox in the form of extensions, that can provide additional functionality, and customised skins that can transform the visual presentation of the browser. Members of the Flock camp do not deny these claims, although they seek to rise above them arguing (rightly, I think) that most users are not willing to install extensions or customise the appearance of their browser. (However, it must be said also that such users are perhaps unlikely to use anything other than the most widely used browsers, indeed are perhaps unlikely to use anything other than Internet Explorer with its default settings (except perhaps for customising the homepage, and being tricked into installing toolbars from the major search engines whilst installing other pieces of software!).</p>

<p>What came to mind last night was the idea that perhaps there is a role for a browser 'sponsored' by the library sector (libraries, ILS(??) vendors and so on) for use on public access computers in libraries.</p>

<p>Why? Another part of the jigsaw was a podcast I listened to on my commute to work this morning, from Bran Ferren at <a href="http://appliedminds.com/">Applied Minds?</a> on user interfaces (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail852.html">IT conversations, web2.0</a>). His argument was that most user interfaces for complex/high performance human tasks are in fact complicated, custom interfaces, rather than generic interfaces.</p>

<p>Now  access to the library catalogues is increasingly provided within libraries using the same web based interface that users can access over the web. This is a good and a bad thing. Good  because users can gain confidence in using the interface within library and can then use it comfortably at home, or work. Bad, because this interface is generic in the sense that it is (often) quite a basic web page rather than a customised application.</p>

<p>The rise of AJAX technologies has enabled the creation of rich interface applications within a browser that look a lot like real clients that you might otherwise find on the desktop, but the library interfaces I have seen to date are not that rich.</p>

<p>Why should libraries use a browser based catalogue interface rather than a custom client that has been designed for the purpose of effectively accessing library services? There is no way we should expect a user to have to install an application on their machine to access library web services (which is why protocols such as Z39.50 are so painful to mash compared to RESTfully defined XML based web services!) but why can't we have these powerful tools to support high performance tasks in the physical library context. After all, if searching library information systems isn't a high performance task, why are information professionals so defensive about providing Google style search interfaces to their users?</p>

<p>This is where a customised browser might come in  it can provide high levels of functionality embedded in the browser. Similar functionality can be provided through the provision of extensions to a user's browser. If a user can be educated to use the extended library browser, and they perceive the value of the extended functionality it provides, they can be shown how to achieve similar levels of functionality in their browsers at home.</p>

<p>Even if a fully fledged customised browser (a la Flock) isn't adopted, then customised browsers with a suite of extensions and added search functionality (such as ) can easily be provided in library foyers. Users might be encouraged to try out such enhanced/extended/customised browsers for themselves by borrowing USB memory drives with portable, customised browsers preloaded on to them (this is perhaps another area where libraries might support wider training functions within an organisation  loaning out software applications in a portable format to users so they can try them out without having to install the software on their own machine).</p>

<p>Libraries could also host web pages containing useful extensions, pre-customised browsers for download etc. </p>

<h3 class="title">One Click Book Reservation</h3>

<p>Another quickie post - I can do 1-click shopping at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468294/026-6903266-8825226">Amazon</a> and have the book arrive at my home the following day, so why can't I make a 1-click book reservation from the <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/">OU Library</a> and have the book delivered to me through the internal mail to my pigeonhole?</p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstand what <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2006/01/library_20_disc.html">Library 2.0</a> is all about, and library staff don't want to have to do the wandering-round-the-library-like-a-slave-getting-books-for-people-mumble-grumble, but as a user who goes in to the office for a couple of days a week (I work from home, mainly) and often don't have the time to go to the library (which is waaaaaaaay over the other side of the campus), it would be so OUseful if while I was working at home I could 1-click a book collection/delivery service on the library catalogue and know the book would be waiting for me when I got to work.</p>

<h3 class="title">How OUseful are iPods? Immediate Impressions</h3>

<p>Two or three weeks ago, the OU Library announced that they were going to start an experimental loans programme for techie toys - iPods, PSPs, and so on - although they have a more grown up name for the project: <a href="http://libraryissues.blogspot.com/2005/12/mobile-and-gaming-technologies-pilot.html"> the mobile and gaming technologies pilot project</a>.</p>

<p>So earlier this week I popped along to the Library to find out more about this project, and found myself leaving with an <a title="Apple - iPod" href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">iPod</a>, which I've never handled before (the PSP's battery had run down and the recharging cable was nowhere to be found..!).</p>

<p>As the Library are looking at ways we can use these technologies to support our HE distance education courses, the iPod came with a selection of education related podcasts, some audio snippets from OU courses, and a few images.</p>

<p>(Hopefully, we'll get some of our <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/report2">Blue Peter robot designs</a> distributed that way (when we eventually get the full database of 32, 000 scanned images onliine, that is) and perhaps some of the other images from our <a href="http://robotgallery.open.ac.uk/">Robot Gallery</a>.)</p>

<p>As I have a 3 hour trip home from the OU, I thought I'd pop a few <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> I hadn't got round to listening to onto the iPod for the journey home.</p>

<p>So - <em>Problem 1</em>:<br />
I only had an old, old, old version on iTunes on my office PC, so thought I'd better do an upgrade. Visiting the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> site, the panel/frame that provides the download link on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes download page</a> wouldn't load - some firewall problem perhaps?</p>

<p>And <em>Solution 1</em>(?): could a recent iTunes installer be provided on the iPod as portable-memory-drive as a default? This would require the iPod to be recognised as a USB?plugin memory device, of course.</p>

<p>Anyway, rather than fight the internet, I thought I'd resolve the issue (of not having a current version of iTunes) by using my laptop, instead. This is after all the machine I'm likely to connect the iPod to most frequently, and I can use it to connect the enterprise public wireless network, which means if there was firewall problem, I can get round it.</p>

<p>So I now have iTunes...</p>

<p>(You'll note that I was assuming that I <em>have</em> to use iTunes - there was no manual as part of the loan (not that' I'd have read it anyway...).</p>

<p>When iTunes first started, I was offered the chance to scan my hard drive for files to add to the Library. Shall I do that - err, no - perhaps not - I have no idea what sort of junk maybe added. I did however drag a few items into the Library. The iPod at this time was not connected...</p>

<p>I also subscribed to a podcast or two (can you grab an OPML file to do this more efficiently?), though I don't recall if this worked properly or not...</p>

<p>For why? Well, to establish web access through the enterprise/public wireless network I need to have a proxy set up in my Firefox settings. Firefox seems to cope with this automatically, according whether I'm at work or at home. Certainly when I tried to access the iStore from iTunes when I got home, I was unable to at first ("Firefox works so why doesn't iTunes???Arrrgggghhhh..." etc.) because I had IE (which I don't use) set to go via the OU public wireless proxy...  I don't remember if I had to set up IE to go via the proxy when I was setting up iTunes at work... (Hmm - perhaps this was the problem with the desktop machine, where I also use Firefox?)</p>

<p>Anyway - I have some content in my iTunes Library, I'm subscribed to a couple of podcasts, now for plugging in the iPod.</p>

<p>There are two things I remember about this:<br />
<ol><li>The iPod took <em>forever</em> to get going once it was plugged in - save for a warning sign and an instruction not to disconnect, there was no info at all as this thing started talking to my laptop. How long would it go on for? There was no progress bar to see...</li><li>I was told that the iPod library differed from the iTunes Library and did I want to replace one with the other...Errr -  no? I forget what happened now - it's all so much of a blur - but as I kept clicking around iTunes to try and reconcile these libraries, and add my podcasts/IT Conversations to the stuff already on the iPod, I kept passing the 'Do you want to replace this library' dialogue ("Err.....no?") and - by not paying attention on one pass clicked <em>yes</em> - ah, good, the iPod is updating....errr...oops, it now has my stuff on it and has deleted all the stuff it came with...</li></ol></p>

<p>So - <em>Problem 2</em>: if I delete all the OU provided content shipped on the iPod when I'm first trying to get to grips with it (by randomly clicking everything, it has to be admitted;-) how do I get it back?</p>

<p><em>Answer 2</em>(?) - provide an RSS/podcast feed from a project page on the Library website that contains this default content.</p>

<p>At least now I have some stuff I know I want to listen to on the iPod for the journey home...</p>

<p>However, my car is an old one with just a radio and cassette deck - so I need a cassette adapter to replace to headphones - good job we have an all-singing, all-dancing Tesco nearby... (the adapter was about 4 quid I think, and with a bit of forcing goes into the iPod carry case...)</p>

<p>Anyway - the journey was a pleasant one, the iPod played through the tracks without my intervention, and it seems perfectly usable...</p>

<p>...except, perhaps, for the following (and I'll perhaps return to these in more detail in a future post):<br />
<ol><li>iPods are set up for music; if I'm listening to course content, it would be useful to see easily what is 'read' and 'unread' (i.e. 'listened to' and 'not yet listened to');</li><li>Can I set up the order tracks play on the iPod (from the iPod)?</li><li>Can I delete tracks from the iPod (on the iPod) when I have listened to them?</li><li>I assume I <em>can</em> organise files in different 'folders' on the iPod via iTunes (e.g. it would be useful to organise tracks by Course, Block/Study Week, topic etc).</li></ol></p>

<p>And here are some more thoughts - from a quick play last night and to which I will return again:<br />
<ol><li><em>Contacts</em>: although not a PDA, the iPod could be shipped with Library contact information (perhaps it was and perhaps I deleted it???). Anyway - a quick test with a vCal file seemed to work (I used one I'd doodled with years ago for  the <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/resources/tscp-contact.vcf">Technology Short Course programme</a>, when I was playing with <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo">microinfo</a> - ideas about  microcontent: calendar and contact info, course WAP pages and so on...);</li><li><em>Calendar</em>: just because, I tried to drag some <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/resources/t184-calendar.vcs">vCal/vcs</a> files over to the iPod Calendar directory, but they didn't appear to work. A quick browse revealed that <em>.ics</em> was the format I needed, so I poppeda few dates into <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!" Calendar</a>, exported and then <a href="http://www.manastungare.com/projects/yahoo2ical/">converted</a> to the correct format.</p>

<p>When I tried a single date in the calendar it worked, when I tried a few it didn't...ho hum - one for when I have a bit more time perhaps...anyway - on the iPod, the successful single entry trial seemed to be delivered via a new option in the iPod Calendar menu, so this looks promising for delivering separate calendars for each and every course a student is subscribed to perhaps? (See the <a href="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo">Microinfo</a> page for hints as to what sort of calendar info may be appropriately delivered. Again, I'll blog that properly when I get a spare couple of hours.)</li></ol></p>

<p>And to finish, here's a silly idea for much later: can we deliver course news to students via the iPod? e.g. by providing a computer voiced reading of course news, or a calendar entry that pops up an alert timed at 1-2 minutes after the student has synched their iPod to their course home page? Should 'useful references/course related books' be made available as <em>notes</em> for the iPod...?</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Links OPML Generator</h3>

<p>In a couple of previous posts (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005240.html">here</a>), I have mentioned how <a href="http://netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> can be used as an alternative interface to <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a> by importing <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005253.html">MyOpenLibrary RSS feeds</a>.</p>

<p><br />
I have just posted a draft version of a page <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseLinksOPML.html">here</a> that wil create an OPML file when provided with an OU course code.</p>

<p>This file can then be uploaded into <em>Netvibes</em> to provide a set of feeds appropriate to that course.</p>

<h3 class="title">OurLibrary</h3>

<p>I've just been quickly looking through <a title="Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters" href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/librarians-guide.shtml">Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters</a>, and immediately started wondering what a social version - <em>Our</em>Library, if you like - might look like...</p>

<p>(Long suffering readers may remember I did a simpler thought experiment for the OU <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES</a> system in the form of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003234.html">Social ROUTES</a>.)</p>

<p>So anyway  - here's some of the MyLibrary stuff that looked like it could be sociable (the empasized quotes are all taken form the <a title="Issues to be addressed by MyLibrary Adopters" href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/librarians-guide.shtml">Issues...</a>  document):</p>

<p><em>"Being a portal sort of application, the content of MyLibrary must be updated frequently or your patrons will cease to use it. You and your staff probably feel your time is already limited. Consequently, you might have to streamline other services, reallocate time and energy, or hire new staff in order to keep MyLibrary running in a manner truly beneficial to your patrons. MyLibrary does not necessarily make your work easier; MyLibrary is a framework for providing Web-based information services in a manner increasingly expected by the typical user of the Internet."</em></p>

<p>Hmm - seems like you need the users to help out here...</p>

<p><em>"Developing a collection management policy for MyLibrary is essential. This policy, along with the controlled vocabulary (described in the next section), provide the intellectual framework for the entire service."</em></p>

<p>Controlled vovablulary...hmmm...ok - if this was a tag based system, you could make recommenadations from the controlled vocabulary. The question arises as to who the controlled voacbulary is supposed to be useful for, of course. If the vocabulary is there to help users locate resources by themselves, perhaps a folksonomy <em>would</em> be more useful?</p>

<p><em>"The collection management policy articulates the qualities of the information resources you will be including in the system."</em></p>

<p>Okay - how about if these resources are based on user recommendations, either implicit ones (clips, bookmarks etc.) or explicit ones (user ratings etc.)?</p>

<p><em>"For better or for worse, the functionality of MyLibrary is predicated on the existence of a flat, controlled vocabulary of subject terms called "disciplines." Everything from the librarians to the information resources to the users of MyLibrary itself are classified with this controlled vocabulary. Without this classification system associations cannot be made between librarians and patrons, patrons and resources, or resources and librarians. The disciplines glue the entire system together."</em></p>

<p>Okay - if there are any tag evangelists out there, do you want to post a comment or two picking up on any of this? (e.g. <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/01/07/folksonomies_controlled_vocabularies.php">here is a debate</a> from the start of this year, and here's <a href="http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html">an paper</a> on a similar topic).</p>

<p><em>"Because of limitations in the systems's implementation, the list of disciplines must be flat, not hierarchial."</em></p>

<p>:-)</p>

<p><em>"The list must be granular enough to satisfy the classification needs of the resources <strong>as well as the interests of the patrons</strong></em> [my emphasis]<em>. At the same time, the list can not be so finely grained that it grows too long to be usable. Try to create a vocabulary that reflects your patrons' needs."</em></p>

<p>Perhaps by letting the users tag stuff themselves, but give them huge hint conditions by offering up the preferred vocabulary terms? For example, the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/buttons">post to del.icio.us</a> bookmarklet pops up a posting indow that contins the user's own tags, as well as suggested/recommended tags based on other users' classification of the resource being bookmarked.</p>

<p><em>"It is recommended that you limit your vocabulary to no more than fifty (50) headings. Larger institutions will require larger controlled vocabulary lists."</em></p>

<p>Sound advice there, perhaps - my taglist on del.icio.us is getting ridiculously long...<br />
 <br />
<em>"Finally, it is imperative you define your disciplines before you do any data-entry. While it is a trivial process to re-classify sets of items in MyLibrary with other discipline headings, removing disciplines that have been assigned to many items requires a process of retrospective conversion that could be avoided if the disciplines are articulated 'correctly' in the first place. A lot of planning now will save even more time later."</em></p>

<p>Hmm - I don;t have that problem reclassifying my del.icio.us bookmarks...</p>

<p><em>"You now need to determine who is going to be providing MyLibrary services. These services include:<ul><li>adding and deleting discipline headings</li><li>adding, classifying, checking, and deleting information resources</li><li>posting global messages as well as messages from the librarians</li><li>sending email messages</li><li>managing patron accounts"</li></ul></em></p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for the reader to determine who provides the above services in a social bookmarking system like del.icio.us or Connotea (please feel free to pst your answer as a comment). Alternatively, who would be responsible in a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">Managaed Social Bookmarking Environment</a>?</p>

<p><em>"The system was designed to be maintained by two sets of people: 1) a webmaster and 2) librarians who specialize in various disciplines...The librarians' responsibilities lie in the maintenance of information resources and the posting of discipline-specific messages. They should be more than familiar with the discipline list. They should be passionate about their disciplines and their profession or their regular performance. Their regular appraisals should include evaluations of MyLibrary implementation. Otherwise there will be little incentive for keeping MyLibrary up-to-date."</em></p>

<p>!</p>

<p><em>"The maintenance of MyLibrary relies on trust, frequent communication between librarians, and a sense of good will. Librarians must trust other service providers not to overwrite their work. Librarians must believe other librarians are going to include valid content in the system. Communication has to take place between all librarians so everybody knows what the others are doing. Everybody has to work under the same set of collection management policies and discipline lists. If somebody wants to add an item to the system, then there is nothing stopping them from doing so. This is an empowering feature. Results are immediate. On the other hand, if you create an atmosphere of centrality, then results will be less immediate and librarians may take less pride in their work and feel less in control. Remember, the names of the librarians are listed right there on every MyLibrary page."</em></p>

<p>Librarians? Not users? Why the distinction? (Bear in mind that the MyLibrary concept predates social bookmarking - but how well would this read if it were recast in the language of social bookmarking/digital resource management? [That was a Lazyweb request, by the way, just in case you didn't notice...])</p>

<p><em>"The actual maintenance of MyLibrary requires brain work and a willingness to use the system's administrative interface. The brain work relies on the ability of the librarians to identify information resources complying with all the policies outlined in the previous sections. Do the resources fit the collection management policy? Can they be classified with one or more of the discipline headings? If not, then the resource must be excluded from the system or the policies must be revised."</em></p>

<p>If you have to rewrite the policy every time you find a useful resource not covered by it, why not just dump the policy and TRUST the users (err, that is, librarians...)?</p>

<p><em>"After information resources are successfully identified, they can be added to the system using the administrative interface. It is a cyclical process involving the completion of simple HTML forms. The process includes:<ol><li>updating discipline headings</li><li>updating librarians classifying them accordingly</li><li>updating information resources classifying them accordingly</li><li>updating discipline defaults</li><li>updating global as well as discipline-specific messages</li><li>sending email to patrons as well as librarians</li><li>evaluating</li><li>returning to Step #3"</li></ol></em></p>

<p>Phew...rather you than me, Ms Librarian, sir, ma'am...! ;-)</p>

<p><em>"The most complete analysis will come from the use of sophisticated SQL queries applied against the MyLibrary database. Given the system's "database dictionary" enumerating it's tables and fields, a person familiar with SQL will be able, today, to answer questions such as:<ul><li>What are the most/least popular disciplines?</li><li>What disciplines use the service the most?</li><li>What are the most/least common resources placed in patrons' profiles?</li><li>On the average, how many times per X do pe ople visit the system from discipline Y?</li><li>Is resource X a part of peoples' profiles who have discipline Y?</li><li>How much do people change their disciplines from the recommended list?</li><li>How often are resources from multiple disciplines placed in peoples' profiles?"</li></ul></em></p>

<p>Some useful tips for user reports there, I think, for developers of social bookmarking systems...</p>

<p><em>"The evaluation/implementation cycle of MyLibrary is unending. Technology changes. Expectations evolve. Roles get modified. Budgets grow and shrink. You know all this. MyLibrary is no exception. Based on your experience, continue with MyLibrary by starting over again with the first step or simply stop using MyLibrary."</em></p>

<p>Exactly...</p>

<h3 class="title">MyOpenLibrary, Frozen Child of MyLibrary</h3>

<p>First off - a confession. I thought that the OU's <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> was an in-house OU sourced package, but it seems I'm wrong: <a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mylibrary/">MyLibrary</a> is actually a thriving third party system that the OU adopted for an extended trial <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/aboutus/myolib/index.html">some years ago</a> (&lt;-- that page breaks in Firefox...).</p>

<p>Secondly, although I suspect the OU installation is lagging behind in terms of its current version, my posts on <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> and <a title="OUseful Info: Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005240.html">Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a>, with titles carefully crafted (?!) to pun <a href="http://web20workgroup.com/">Web 2.0</a>, are actually retrograde in that MyLibrary is currently at version 2.63 and set to go to version 3.0.</p>

<p>So that's me 'fessed up...</p>

<p>Anyway - now that I've found the MyLibrary site, I'll go and have a quick play to see if the direction it has gone in bears any resemblance to the MyOpenLibrary 2.0 tinkerings I've been blogging about for the last week.</p>

<p>I also need to go and do a bit more digging around the <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> 'Link Display Manager', which so far is the best app I've come across for feeding links into for display purposes.</p>

<p>One thing that I would like to be able to do in Netvibes, though, is to plug in arbitrary <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch</a> links...</p>

<h3 class="title">Even More OU Library RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>Thanks to James McNulty's Midas period in the OU Library over the last week, in which everything he touched turned to RSS, there is now a host of new RSS feeds available over and above those mentioned <a title="OUseful Info: More OU Library XML Feeds" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005227.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>First off, a feed for <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_patron_details.php?l_name=XXXX&barcode=NNNNN">User Loans info</a> (you'll find this link doesn't work without some necessary authentication data - name and Library Barcode to be exact...).</p>

<p>Then a host of feeds related to <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibray</a>. For example:</p>

<p><l><li>Ebooks: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_ebooks.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Databases: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_databases.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Journals: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_ejournals.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>ROUTES: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_routes.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Reference Shelf: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_reference.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>OpenUniversity Links <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_links.php?course=A300">Example feed for course A300</a></li><br />
<li>Articles: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_recread.php?course=A840">Example feed for course A840</a></li><br />
<li>Help and Support: <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_librarians.php?course=A840">Example feed for course A840</a></li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>NB To follow some of the links contained within the feeds you need to go in through the OU authentication system.</p>

<p>To make consuming sets of feeds easier - for example on a per course basis - I've started playing around with OPML files. For example, try this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/A300.opml">OPML file of feeds for A300</a>. It seems to work okay in Netvibes, at least...</p>

<p>PS Another addition: an RSS feed of <a href="http://library2.open.ac.uk/rss/rss_overdue.php?l_name=blah&barcode;=blah">my overdue library books</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PPS ROUTES XML SEARCH now available</strong: for example: <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish">http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml_search_rss.php?search=spanish</a><br />
The search is currently over descriptions - James asks whether it should be over keywords... I wonder if it shoul dbe over both as a default?</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Profiles for MyOpenLibrary 2.0</h3>

<p>One of the key issues related to course related <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk">MyOpenLibrary</a> page that I didn't address in my post on <a title="OUseful Info: MyOpenLibrary 2.0" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> was the problem of seeding individual students' pages with link/topic boxes related to the courses the student is registered on.</p>

<p>What's really needed for any institutionally supported MyLibrary service is the ability to define profiles according to topic, or subject, area, registered course and so on, that provides a default setting for, or addition to, the MyLibrary desktop.</p>

<p>Rather usefully - from the point of view of feeding link lists into a MyLibrary service - <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> shows the way forward with its ability to import <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> lists of RSS feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesLoadOPML.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesLoadOPML.JPG" width="620" height="346" border="0" /></p>

<p>Once an OPML file is uploaded, the individual feeds are then offered in a list of feeds, from hich the user may choose to add tem to the desktop, rather than them being added to the desktop automatically:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesAddOPMLFeed.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesAddOPMLFeed.JPG" width="535" height="518" border="0" /></p>

<p>One other point worth mentioning here that I don't think I've mentioned before is that Netvibes allows users to place topic boxes in particular places on the desktop/canvas, albeit constrained by a 3 column grid (?or perhaps there are additional layout prefeneces I haven't come across yet that allow for even more flexibility in placing boxes?)</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Related Sites</strong></p>

<p>While on the topic, it's probably worth mentioning <a href="http://www.protopage.com/">Protopage</a> here. Protopage is another service that allows users to place tables filled with user defined links <em>anywhere</em> on a 'web desktop'. However, users must add <em>each link</em> to each table individually, which can be quite laborious...</p>

<p>Whilist still in v1.0 beta, version 2.0 of Protopage does promise support for RSS feeds though...</p>

<p>It's hard to see how Protopage can improve too much on the Netvibes model, though, apart from its 'place a table anywhere' feature. After all, these aren't services where feature overlaod would be too welcome, methinks...</p>

<p>Finally, <a href=-"http://www.memeflow.com/goto/">Memeflow GoTo</a> pages provide a similar offering to Protopage, but in even cruder form. Unlike Netvibes and Protopage, which are both reasonably slick,  the GoTo pages are very crude and don't really offer anything over the other two...<br />
</p>

<h3 class="title">More OU Library XML Feeds</h3>

<p>Things are move swiftly in terms of the OU Library's    support for XML feeds - the latest 'beta' is an RSS feed of <a title="Patron Logon" href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=pbLogon">personal loans</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="myLibraryRecord.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myLibraryRecord.JPG" width="551" height="643" border="0" /></p>

<p>I don't think I can publish a URL yet (in part because it contains my Library number in plaintext) but here are a couple examples of it in use.</p>

<p>Firstly, in my <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> page:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesLoans.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesLoans.JPG" width="633" height="530" border="0" /></p>

<p>Secondly, in a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks">Firefox Live Bookmark</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="liveBookmark.JPG" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/liveBookmark.JPG" width="396" height="318" border="0" /></p>

<p>It's easy enough to imagine feeding this information  - along with the Library's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005088.html">new books info</a> - in to a <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a> (or <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005219.html">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</a> page, come to that!).</p>

<p>There's no reason why it couldn't be fed to an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=konfabulator">OU Library Konfabulator widget</a> either...</p>

<h3 class="title">MyOpenLibrary 2.0</h3>

<p>There have been a few posts recently (such as <a title="dave's blog: Creating a Personalized "My Library" page with no sweat" href="http://daweed.blogspot.com/2005/11/creating-personalized-my-library-page.html">dave's blog: Creating a Personalized "My Library" page with no sweat</a>) commenting on how <a href="http://www.netvibes.com"> Netvibes</a> can be used as a MyLibrary style portal.</p>

<p>I've been compiling a 'report' on this in my stolen time, and while it's not finished yet I think it may be appropriate to add a few thoughts to the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>MyOpenLibrary</strong></p>

<p>With the growing number of electronic resources available to OU students, several approaches have been used across OU systems to provide students with semi-customisable links pages, such as the <a href="http://student.open.ac.uk/>student homepage</a> which leads to a personalised page when the user passes through the common authentication service, or the OU Library <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary </a> service.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a> service offers a significant degree of personalisation via a customisable page that allows users to link to electronic resources on particular themes:  E-journals, <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES</a> Links, a Reference Shelf, E-books, Help and Support, Open University Links, Personal Links.</p>

<p><img alt="myOpenLibrary.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/myOpenLibrary.jpg" width="490" height="410" border="0" /></p>

<p>(The styling is wayward because the page was designed to take into account the quirks of Internet Explorer, rather than conform to common standards, as used in browsers such as Firefox (shown here) or Opera.)</p>

<p>All the panels offer a link to an about page, and a user customisation page that allows the user to add links to a panel from a set of pre-selected links relevant to the theme of the panel.</p>

<p><em>Search Options</em></p>

<p>In addition, users are able to select a search engine from among a predefined set. For my account, a choice of three search engines were offered as a default: Internet (Google); OU Library catalogue (all items); OU Library catalogue (electronic items).</p>

<p>From the customisation link, users can choose to add additional search engines to their list of options (though not <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo</a> as yet. Rather surprisingly, (for what is presumably in my case a Technology default profile), the <a href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk">EEVL</a> search engine was not offered as an option.</p>

<p>The benefits of offering the search option from MyOpenLibrary are arguable for students who typically access the internet from the same browser on the same computer, compared for example with the ability to customise the search engines used from the browser toolbar (or from bespoke, user installed toolbars). Not only must the user open their MyOpenLibrary page in the browser, they must also log in through the OU authentication system to do so.</p>

<p><em>Topic Panels</em></p>

<p>The topic panels provided on the MyOpenLibrary page categorise links according to themes to help the user as they browse the page find the single link they need quickly on a page filled with links. The separate configurability of each panel allows the user willing to invest time in this customisation process to tune the MyOpenLibrary page to suit their own needs. If an expected link is not available as a default in the panel, the customise link takes the user to a page that contains additional related links.</p>

<p>One possible problem with this approach is the stranglehold that the MyOpenLibrary administrators on deciding what links are allowed in what topic panel. Whilst there is obvious value in collating good quality links on individual topics, there is also a lack of flexibility:<ol><li>with respect to adding new links;</li><li>with respect to identifying new topics.</li></ol></p>

<p>When I rediscovered the MyOpenLibrary page (having not visited it for several weeks), I was immediately struck how it would be possible to use the structure of the page as a viewer for tagged bookmarks with each panel displaying links associated with a particular tag or combination of tags.</p>

<p>This approach also suggests how userConfig tags might be used to help display links - or not - from a social bookmarking service such as <a href="http://www.connotea.org">Connotea</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> marked with a particular tag.</p>

<p>Most social bookmarking services provide an RSS feed of links corresponding to one or more particular users, tags, or any combination thereof. For example:</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/psychemedia/livelinks?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon"></script><br />
<noscript><a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/livelinks">my del.icio.us</a></noscript></p>

<p>(The above livelinks could easily have been styled in a MyOpenLibrary like table - just no time at the moment!)</p>

<p>Now, imagine I have three bookmarks tagged as library but only want to display two of them (although I do want them all bookmarked. The setting of user preferences as to which of a set of relevant links are displayed now becomes as simple as adding a MOL:display tag, for example, and then displaying links tagged as <em>library+MOL:display</em></p>

<p>If the user does not want a link they have tagged as library displayed, then all they have to do is remove the MOL:display tag. Note that this could be done seamlessly via a bookmarklet (remove this link, for example).</p>

<p>Just as a list of relevant links for a topic were made available via the customisation pages, so a similar approach may be made in a social bookmarking scheme, where for example links associated with a particular tag are listed along with a bookmarklet to add the link to the students bookmark list and set the MOL:display tag.</p>

<p>In a social bookmarking system, note that related links may be displayed in panels that identify the provenance of a link  for example, whether it was suggested by the library,  the course team for a particular course, from ROUTEs, one or more students, or academics, and so on. So by introducing a general bookmarking system  and in particular a social bookmarking system  we are able to go from MyOpenLibrary to OUrOpenLibrary</p>

<p>It is also possible to identify which tags should be used as the basis for display panels. For example, imagine bookmarking the RSS feed for a particular tag (or tag combination) for a particular user and tagging it as MOL:displayPanel. A server script based on the following pseudo-code could then render the appropriate panels:</p>

<p>For each tag feed tagged with MOL:displayPanel:<br />
 - Create Panel<br />
 - Add Panel Title<br />
 - For each link in tag feed<br />
 - - Render Link</p>

<p><strong>Free Customisable Links Pages on the Web.</strong></p>

<p>One extreme form of customisable links page corresponds to a users personal page within a social bookmarking system. There are many examples of social bookmarking services available, but I shall concentrate on del.icio.us as it is, at the time of writing, one of the most popular  and well used  services. </p>

<p>The simple styling of the del.icio.us interface, which has been copied in part by several other social bookmarking schemes, provides a straightforward list of bookmarks, ordered by time, with the most recent bookmark at the top of the first page. A tag selection panel allows the user to view the links associated with a particular tag, or combination of tags.</p>

<p>As it stands, the del.icio.us interface does not allow the user to configure a number of panels, cf. the MyOpenLibrary interface, with each panel containing links for a corresponding tag, for example. A MyOpenLibrary style interface could be implemented using scripts that pull the RSS feed for particular (combinations of) tags into distinct panels using an RSS to javascript service, or server based RSS display script, to give a similar layout to the MyOpenLibrary interface. However, as it stands, the multiple, almost concurrent requests that would be made to del.icio.us whenever the page is loaded would (I think) contravene the del.icio.us user API guildelines (too many requests in a short period of time) and consequently some of the requests may be denied by del.icio.us.</p>

<p><strong>Using Netvibes as a public MyOpenLibrary Equivalent</strong></p>

<p>A recently launched service  <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>  allows users to configure any number of user created panels with any number of links. If the user always accesses the page from the same browser (e.g. always from the same machine ??or from a portable browser on a USB memory stick, for example) then the users customised page is displayed whenever the user visits the site. More general access to the users customised page is guaranteed by creating an account on the system and customising the page when logged in.</p>

<p><img alt="netvibes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibes.jpg" width="472" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p>Recent customisable, personal page services announced by <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google</a> and <a href="http:/live.com">Microsoft</a> can also be used to display links provided as RSS feeds:</p>

<p><img alt="google_ig.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/google_ig.jpg" width="472" height="422" border="0" /></p>

<p><strong>A Way Forward for the OU?</strong></p>

<p>When considering the design of a links page, there are several factors that need to be taken into account:<br />
<ul><li>Aesthetics/page design</li><br />
<li>Degree of customisation</li><br />
<li>Provision of seed links</li><br />
<li>Recommendations for additional customised links</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>It is also worth considering the separation of link tables (that is, the collection of links displayed in a particular panel as a distinct set of links) and their presentation, particularly insofar as other systems might be used display any link table independently of the others.</p>

<p>For example, one might imagine a MyOpenLibrary-like display acting as a link aggregator, with different panels containing links relevant to different courses. The course related link tables that provide content for each of the display panels might also be used to feed a single panel in a course specific page.</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Library RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>I've just updated <a title="OUseful Info: RSS Ripples Within the OU..." href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004420.html">OUseful Info: RSS Ripples Within the OU...</a> to reflect that the OU library is now offering <a title="The Open University Library" href="http://library.open.ac.uk/resources/newstock.html">RSS feeds of new stock</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="OUlibraryNewBooksRSS.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/OUlibraryNewBooksRSS.jpg" width="624" height="665" border="0" /></p>

<p>Very nice... even though I only found these links by chance as I was having a quick look round the newly redesigned <a href="http://library.open.ac.uk/">OU Library website</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Toolbars as Mindgrab?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4310474.stm">recent announcement</a> that Google will be making downloads of Sun's OpenOffice suite in exchange for a Google toolbar browser download with every Java SDK was picked up nicely by this post from John Battelle: <a title="John Battelle's Searchblog: Google-Sun - The Toolbar, Ay, There's the Rub" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001914.php">John Battelle's Searchblog: Google-Sun - The Toolbar, Ay, There's the Rub</a>.</p>

<p>And the rub is?</p>

<p><em>"In other words, Google really, really wants more Toolbar distribution."</em></p>

<p>If users continue to spend more and more time in their browser, it's easy to see that making a grab for a permament piece of browser real estate is a  sensible thing to do... </p>

<p>So why's that interesting for  the OU? Well, what of there was an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=toolbar">OU toolbar</a>? For current students it would combine at least Library and course resources (with the odd link to course sales web pages, of course), for non-students tools to access open content learning materials, perhaps, as well as 'public' OU sites.</p>

<p>Why? First off (for current students) - time-saving and added value. For prospective students, easier access to open content learning resources (and perhaps an open content OU VLE?)</p>

<p>Far off - search and Google are now, to many people, synonymous. If we want lifelong, web based learning and the OU to have a similar realtionship in people's minds, we need presence - and the toolbar is a good way - at the moment -  to provide it...</p>

<h3 class="title">Reverse ROUTES</h3>

<p>A passing comment in my <a title="OUseful Info: OU Course Info Search" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004395.html">previous post</a> inspired the following thought that I'd lose if I didn't blog it now...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">OU MyOpenLibrary</a> personalisation service offers, among other things, a Google search option I think (though I couldn't find one for <a href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk/">EEVL</a> on my account, which I thought was an automation oversight).</p>

<p>So  - if I search Google and get a bunch of links back, then would it be worth checking to see if this are cited as useful links for a particular course on ROUTES?</p>

<p>Or if ROUTES moved over to a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1149&search=social+routes">Social ROUTES</a> approach, the Google links could all be cross-checked to see if they have been bookmarked in Social ROUTES with any course tags.</p>

<p>Why bother? Well, it's an almost effortless way of offering up a targeted course advert, based on courses that have been related to the objects of a student's more general search by students doing those courses (or resources identified as relevant to the course by the CT).</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Course Info Live Search?</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I read a lot of Library blogs is not because that's where the cutting edge of disseminating information is*, but because they occasionally report about nifty catalogue interfaces...</p>

<p>[* IMHO ;-) many libraries appear to fight against adopting standards and strategies the real world uses, because they are, perhaps, a bit ropey in terms of classification and metadata compared to what information professionals are used to, or at least, compared to what they expect to use...]</p>

<p>The OU has several catalogues, of course, of which perhaps the most important in 'sales' terms  is the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?A02">OU course catalogue</a>. </p>

<p>I have in the past tried tinkering with very unofficial not quite extensions to this service, such as the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/courseSearch.php">OUseful course search</a> (which I still need to provide a search interface form for, although I have exposed a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/webService.php">SOAP web service interface</a> to it),  the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful Course Book Search</a> (which allows you to search for books associated with OU courses) or an easy to remember <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/redirects.php">redirect</a> to the course choice pages).</p>

<p>However, one thing I haven't looked at is a <em>live search</em> in which the results are displayed as you type (for example, try out the live search <a href="http://1976design.com/blog/">this blog</a>).</p>

<p>Live search would be a cool toy, if nothing else, if applied to the OU catalogue, or indeed the OU Voyager library catalogue (and I guess, my OUseful search tools...).</p>

<p>Here's an example of what a <a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2005/09/quick_searching.html">bibliographic database</a> live search interface might look like, for eample (look for the link to the <em>movie</em>).</p>

<p>Live search is interesting to me in part because:</p>

<p>1) it's predictive;</p>

<p>2) you get a feel, as you type, for whether your search is going where you want it to;</p>

<p>3) before the predictive element starts to work properly, there is the possibility of a serendipitous find <em>on the way to</em> the actual target of  your search.</p>

<p>If the OU is to open up some of it's content (and I hope to post more on this in the next week or two)  then helping people find and reuse it (as well as remixing it) will become increasingly important.</p>

<p>Cross-linking course books and ROUTES resources  with course codes will also allow for a much expanded search engine, which will cast a wider net of search terms over the courses we offer. By which I mean, if your search hits on a book that is used in a particular course, for example, then you can return the course as an associated, or related link.</p>

<p><em>PS Searching legacy content/teaching materials <em>internally</em> is also an issue that doesn't appear to have been addressed yet, although the much heralded new ECM system may offer this facility...</p>

<p>I dream of the day when we let Google Print scan all our legacy content/materials from expired courses, so that internally at least we can use it as a teaching material encycolpedia, and perhaps even get to reuse the some of the content (I suspect one of the reasons we don't reuse content much is because we can't find it/don't know it exists...). It would be nice if the old content was wikified, too, so that we could start to use it as living material and perhaps get a community co-revising, or co-maintaining (rather than strictly co-creating) the materials, but I suspect that's too much to wish for...</em></p>

<h3 class="title">Keeping Courses Current with Live Links</h3>

<p>This quick post - culled from an email message that was part of another discussion - builds on some of the thoughts introduced in an earlier post <a title="OUseful Info: Managing Bookmarks" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002721.html">Managing Bookmarks</a> and considers some of the ways we might manage 'Live Bookmarks' in our online courses...</p>

<p>The question at hand was the extent to which we could use a <a href="http:routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES-like</a> bookmark management system to keep links in e-course materials current, e.g. by using a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003242.html">ROUTES XML feed</a> to populate the weblinks for the site (<a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml.php?course=Technology">example feed</a>). This would be handy for course teams because it means that the Library could keep an eye on the weblinks for the site as part of the normal linkchecking'n'fixing workflow applied to ROUTES links...</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it would be for ROUTES  to replace all the external URLs with equivalent ROUTES redirect URLs: as <a href="http://students.open.ac.uk/desktop/t846-05e/resources-p3">T846</a> have done with their Links to referenced material.</p>

<p>Something else to consider is the extent to which  a level of indirection between links in the course materials, and the final pages would allow for easier link checking.</p>

<p>(I don't know the extent to which ROUTES uses <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003940.html">DOIs</a>, or the extent to which ROUTES references can be treated as persistent URLs in their own right, but there is probably some scope here for thinking about persistent, indirect addressing.)</p>

<p>As well as allowing persistent (if indirect) links in the course materials, this indirection/intermediation potentially opens up other benefits...</p>

<p>For example, in some parts of the course, we have what effectively amount to 'Suggested further reading' weblinks. Some of these may date, deprecate, move etc, at other times the author may wish to add links that are current or particularly topical (notwithstanding the upset this is likely to cause in editorial quarters)</p>

<p>To recap, then, one way forward for link management is towards a bookmarking service that feeds links in to a page.</p>

<p>So for example, a list of 'Further Information' links at the bottom of a page could be replaced with something like:</p>

<p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://del.icio.us/rss/T184/automation%2Bcourselink"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/rssViewerJS.php?rssURL=http://del.icio.us/rss/T184/automation%2Bcourselink"></script></p>

<p><br />
There are issues of course - to use the service, you need to be online. Cookies can hold up to about 4k, so this may provide one way of storing link info in the user's offline cache. Alternatively, if we install other s/w, then a set of 'default', or 'core' links could be installed to provide some recommended links when the student is offline.</p>

<h3 class="title">Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)</h3>

<p>In my previous post, (<a title="OUseful Info: Social Bookmarking the Academic Way" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003938.html">OUseful Info: Social Bookmarking the Academic Way</a>) I included, but didn't link, a couple of DOIs (<a href="http://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifiers</a>).</p>

<p><em>"DOIs are names assigned to any entity for use on digital networks. They are used to provide current information, including where they (or information about them) can be found on the Internet. Information about a digital object may change over time, including where to find it, but its DOI will not change."</em> <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI Foundation</a></p>

<p>Just to recall waht they look like, here are the ones from that previous post:</p>

<p>- doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond<br />
- doi:10.1045/april2005-lund</p>

<p>So  - what can we do with them?</p>

<p>Well for a start, we can find the resource from them using a DOI Resolver:</p>

<form method=POST action="http://dx.doi.org/">DOI: <input type=text name="hdl" value="" size=45> <input type=SUBMIT value="Submit"> <input type=RESET value="Reset"></form>

<p>The DOI Foundation also provide some bookmarklets for retrieving a document if you highlight it's DOI in your browser. You can <a href="http://www.doi.org/resolver_button/doibutton.html">find the bookmarklets here</a>.</p>

<p>When I get an evening's playtime, I'll cook up a Greasemonkey script to linkify DOIs that can be scraped off a page (a bit like my <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/04/uk-postcode-linker-using-greasemonkey.html">Postcode linkifier</a> or an <a href="http://www.mundell.org/2005/04/27/librarylookup-greasemonkey-script/">ISBN linkifier</a>.</p>

<p>It might also be worth trying to work out a few sensible DOI toolbar buttons...</p>

<h3 class="title">Social Bookmarking the Academic Way</h3>

<p>When I blogged about the potential for a <a title="OUseful Info: Relevant News and Social ROUTES?" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003234.html">Social ROUTES?</a> collaborative bookmarking system, I had in mind something built upon <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.</p>

<p>Del.icio.us has been going from strength to strength, lately, not only in terms of 3rd party tools and extensions (the AJAX enabled <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/">del.icio.us direc.tor</a> is one of my favourites... for a complete list, check out the <a href="http://pchere.blogspot.com/2005/02/absolutely-delicious-complete-tool.html">Absolutely Del.icio.us - Complete Tool Collection</a>). </p>

<p>However, there are still a few things that del.icio.us doesn;t do, such as support group tagging (i.e. one account with several members).</p>

<p>So it my interest was aroused earlier this week when I stumbled across <a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>, a social bookmarking service for academics set up by the Nature Publishing Group (who have graciously <a href="http://www.connotea.org/code">open-sourced software</a>). I was reminded about Connotea again today when following a short post to the del.icio.us mailing list about Social ROUTES (that did not mention Connotea) I got this presumption(!) from Tony Hammond at NPG:</p>

<p><em>[<a href="http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>] provides a growing body of reference management functionalities and will query authority sources for metadata (both publisher-specific platforms and also CrossRef). It supports RIS import/export, RSS feeds, etc. DOI bookmarking is a new feature as of last week, and in the next few days we expect to turn on OpenURL linking. What else? Oh user groups, private bookmarking, embargo dates, and a bunch of other stuff. Connotea is under active development and is a free service being run by NPG.</em></p>

<p>Good, eh? Tony also provided a couple of links to articles about Social Bookmarking tools in general, and Connotea in particular, which are well worth a look:</p>

<p><a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html">Social Bookmarking Tools (I): A General Overview</a><br />
Tony Hammond, Timo Hannay, Ben Lund and Joanna Scott, Nature Publishing Group<br />
doi:10.1045/april2005-hammond</p>

<p><a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/april05/lund/04lund.html ">Social Bookmarking Tools (II): A Case Study - Connotea</a><br />
Ben Lund, Tony Hammond and Timo Hannay, Nature Publishing Group; and Martin Flack, NeoReality, Inc.<br />
doi:10.1045/april2005-lund</p>

<p>Connotea also link to another social bookmarking site for academics - <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>. Again, this appears to offer support for groups, and a useful looking <em>Import from BibTex</em> facility. Unlike Connotea, which has corporate support, CiteULike is a personal venture. However, del.icio.us got funded, so perhaps CiteULike will find a benefactor too (surely <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> must be able to support this sort of thing?)</p>

<p>When I get a chance, I'll explore the Connotea and CiteULike sites in a bit more detail, and then perhaps post an updated doodled on the potential of a Social ROUTES system...</p>

<p>PS here's another social bookmarking system for education undergoing tests: <a href="http://idea.zanestate.edu/archives/2005/08/announcing-scuttledu/">ScuttlEDU</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">OAI Access to OU ePrint Repository</h3>

<p>Lest I forget before I get a chance to play with it, the <a href="http://libeprints.open.ac.uk/">OU repository</a>, which is implemented using an <a href="http://www.eprints.org/">eprints</a> server, has this exposed <a href="http://libeprints.open.ac.uk/perl/oai2">OAI interface</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what it's good for yet (!), but I'm sure that a quick peek at the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archive Initiative (OAI)</a> site will provide a few clues, as will as play with this <a href="http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/">OAI Repository Explorer</a>.</p>

<p>While I'm at it, here are a few more links in the ballpark: <a href="http://www.oaforum.org/otherfiles/berl_desompel.ppt">an overview of OAI</a>, a possibly useful <a href="http://celestial.eprints.org/stylesheets/celestial.xsl">XSL styylesheet</a>, <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july03/young/07young.html">a useful(?) article</a>, a look at  <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february05/sanderson/02sanderson.html">OAI and SRW/U</a>...</p>

<h3 class="title">Greasemonkey XML Feed for ROUTES</h3>

<p>Quite some time ago, I produced a screenscraper for the OU Library <a title="ROUTES Homepage" href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/ROUTES/index.html">ROUTES</a> service that produced an <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ROUTEScraper.php">RSS feed</a> of the search results.</p>

<p>Some time later, the Library trialled an XML output feed (e.g. this example for the course <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/routes_xml.php?course=T396&sub;=1">T396</a>) but as far as I know it was never publicised on the ROUTES pages. It also just seems to be tied to outputs from course searches. (I guess the API could be rather more complete, but trying a search using a <em>keyword</em> attribute didn't work, for example.)</p>

<p>My ROUTES-RSS generator can be called straightforwardly via an HTTP GET, as this example shows:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ROUTEScraperRSS.php?ccode=artificial%20intelligence">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ROUTEScraperRSS.php?ccode=artificial%20intelligence</a></p>

<p>As mentioned, this tool has been languishing largely unused for sometime, so today I thought I'd spend half an hour instaed of lunch plugging it into the ROUTES search results page with a <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> script.</p>

<p>Once installed, the script adds an obvious XML-RSS feed to the page. See if you can spot it:</p>

<p><img alt="ROUTES-XML.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ROUTES-XML.jpg" width="606" height="446" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to give the script a go, make sure you have Greasemonkey installed  (we're talking Firefox, here, naturally ;-), pop over to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/routesXMLlinky.user.js">OU-ROUTES XML linky script</a>, and select <em>Install User Script...</em> from the browser <em>Tools</em> menu.</p>

<p>If you now do a search on the ROUTES catalogue, you should get the RSS results feed too. (If it's a frequent search, why not make the link a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html">Live Bookmark</a>?</p>

<p>What surprised me (not really) was how easy this was to do once I got my head round the Greasemonkey script. And it was quick too - half an hour or so playtime instead of lunch...</p>

<p>With tools like Greasmonkey available, personal remixing of pages (and <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/04/wep-page-plus-personal-semantic.html">Web Page+</a>) is only just beginning...</p>

<h3 class="title">Firefox Advanced Search Screencast</h3>

<p>A couple of week ago, I posted my first couple of attempts (since updated on the same URL) at building <a title="Tony Hirst: OU Firefox Search Plugins" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002978.html">OU Firefox Search Plugins</a>, described in their simplest form in this <a href="http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/3033">Firefox hack excerpt</a>. These plugins provide additional search engines within the Firefox Search toolbar (in the post described above, plugins for the OU Search Engine, the OU Voyager Library Catalogue, and the OU IET (public) knowledge network).</p>

<p>Since then, I've stumbled across the <a href="http://searchsidebar.mozdev.org/">Firefox <em>Advanced Search Sidebar</em></a>.  To briefly summarise, the <em>Advanced Search sidebar</em> allows you to select one or more search engines, or create profiles containing one or more search engines, and perform a metasearch over them.</p>

<p>This apparently recreates some of the functionality of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/search/">Mozilla search</a> and explains the &lt;INTERPRET&gt; tag in the <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/interprettag.html">search extension definition</a>.</p>

<p>What the extension does is to scrape the results from each search engine results page and redisplay them in the sidebar, as well as in an aggregated results page. You also have the option of displaying the results from each search engine directly and independently of the results from the other selected search engines.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screenscraping</a> is keyed by identifying the region of the search page within which the results can be found, as well as notable code fragments surrounding each search result item. The scraped results correspond to the first (?) link found in the item, and are described by the link text.</p>

<p>For example, this <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=luddites&Search_Code=FT*&CNT=50">keyword search on the OU library catalogue for <em>luddites</em></a> returns a handful of search results:</p>

<p><img alt="voyagerLuddites.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/voyagerLuddites.jpg" width="602" height="715" border="0" /></p>

<p>The titles and links of each of these responses are scraped and republished in the sidebar.</p>

<p><img alt="searchSidebar.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchSidebar.jpg" width="579" height="377" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are a couple of problems though. Firstly, the library catalogue results are tied to a session ID, rather than a persistent URL, and as such may time out (although this could be managed by rewriting the URL in the sidebar script). Secondly, where an image tag forms part of the search result link text, as it does for instance in the results from the OU search engine, the result cannot be displayed (at the time of writing, only textual links are valid).</p>

<p>The search engines that you can search over are the same search engines that are 'installed' within the search toolbar. As soon as you install new search engines into the toolbar (as for example the OU search engine plugins mentioned above, or any of the other plugins described on the <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/">Mycroft search plugin page</a>) it becomes available in the <em>Advanced Search Sidebar</em>.</p>

<p>If you still aren't sure what it is the extension does, and aren't convinced enough to try it out for yourself, I have produced a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/screencast/advancedSearch.html">short screencast featuring an OU metasearch</a> to show the extension in action...</p>

<h3 class="title">MyLibraryRecord</h3>

<p>One of the obvious improvements to v0.1 of my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library Toolbar</a> is  to tweak the <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=pbLogon"><em>My Library Record</em> bookmark</a> so that instead of opening the 'login' page, it  logs you in automatically.</p>

<p>As I don't have time just at the moment to hack around with the toolbar, I thought I'd prototype this functionality with a Firefox bookmarklet.  There are a couple of issues though.</p>

<p>Firstly, the bookmarklet needs to reveal my surname and library card number. I'm not sure how 'secret' this info is, but assuming I'm not supposed to reveal it (a password widget is used to enter it, after all) means that I can't publish a full working demo of the bookmarklet here...unless the library has a dummy user account I can borrow...;-)</p>

<p>Secondly, the form used to gain access to My Library Record uses an HTTP POST, rather than a GET. GET would be easy - POST is trickier... However, I tracked down a <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/03/bookmarklets-form-post-data-and-more_14.html">workaround for this</a> before, so reusing that approach gives us:</p>

<p> - <a href="javascript:void(d=document);libID='';surname='';uri='http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi';f=d.createElement('form');f.method='post';f.action=uri;i0=d.createElement('select');i0.name='LGNT';i0.value=0;i1=d.createElement('input');i1.type='hidden';i1.name='BC';i1.value=libID;i2=d.createElement('input');i2.name='LN';i2.value=surname;i3=d.createElement('input');i3.type='hidden';i3.name='PAGE';i3.value='pbPatron';i4=d.createElement('input');i4.type='hidden';i4.name='DB';i4.value='local';f.appendChild(i0);f.appendChild(i1);f.appendChild(i2);f.appendChild(i3);f.appendChild(i4);d.body.appendChild(f);f.submit();">a <em>MyLibraryRecord</em> bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>This bookmarklet is probably too long for IE, but it works okay in Firefox. To use it:</p>

<p>1) drag it onto your Firefox bookmarks toolbar;<br />
2) right click on it and go into <em>Properties</em>;<br />
3) In the <em>Location</em> field, look along the javascript code and insert your <em>Surname</em> and <em>OU Library Card number</em> in the appropriate places (e.g. <em>libID='0310073861';surname='Other'</em>);<br />
4) Click on <em>Okay</em>.</p>

<p>When you click on this bookmarklet, you should be taken straight to your Library Record page.</p>

<h3 class="title">More Library Toolbars</h3>

<p>Last week I posted a screencast on the features supported by the <a title="Tony Hirst: cf. the Jackson Library Toolbar" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003075.html">Jackson Library Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, I've discovered this <a href="http://scilib.typepad.com/science_library_pad/firefox_extensions/">Firefox Library Extensions</a>, which pointed me in the direction of a couple more exciting toolbars:</p>

<p>- the <a href="http://www.asl.edu/library/halbar/">HALBar Toolbar</a>, and<br />
- the <a href="http://everything.no-ip.org/mb/">Maldura Library Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm back on a machine with <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/products/studio/default.asp">Camtasia</a> installed on it, I'll do another toolbar feature screencast looking at these extensions, but for now you'll have to make do with a screenshot (that also includes my first attempt at an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003041.html">OU Library Toolbar</a> [top] along with the <a href="http://www.athensams.net/news/toolbar161104.html">MyAthens toolbar</a> [bottom]) and a brief description:</p>

<p><img alt="toolbars.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/toolbars.jpg" width="909" height="208" border="0" /></p>

<p>So - very briefly then, what's on offer?</p>

<p>At the top of the screenshot, my <em>OU Library toolbar</em> provides a drop down list of homepages, the search box, a drop down list of which catalgue to search, a button that uses the textbox search term to search directly on the OU Voyager catalogue, a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Library Lookup</a> shortcut, a shortcut to <em>Librarians on Call</em> and a shortcut to <em>My Library Record</em>. (This is not too dissimilar to the <a href="http://wesley.stanford.edu/library/toolbar/">Jackson Library Toolbar</a>.)</p>

<p>The <em>HALBar</em> provides a set of shortcuts to various homepages, a drop down list of available catalogues, followed by a second drop down list of searches (keyword, title, ISBN, and so on) and then the search textbox. This simple design allows you to offer a semblance of semi-advanced search on the catalogues in quite an efficient way.</p>

<p>The <em>Maldura Library Toolbar</em> is one of the most sophisticated search toolbars I've seen to date, at least in its use of widgets!</p>

<p><img alt="malduraToolbar.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/malduraToolbar.jpg" width="925" height="31" border="0" /></p>

<p>A series of info pages (including <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/malduraToolbarPrefs.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/malduraToolbarPrefs.html','popup','width=597,height=481,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">a pop-up toolbar preferences window</a>) are followed by a couple of menus containing homepage shortcuts. This is followed by a series of different catalogue searches. Each one allows you to search on one of a variety of search fields (tile, author, etc.) via a search menu:</p>

<p><img alt="malduraToolbarSearchOptions.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/malduraToolbarSearchOptions.jpg" width="422" height="213" border="0" /></p>

<p>It is also possible to highlight the search term within the results page.</p>

<p>Finally, the <em>MyAthens toolbar</em> provides access to journals and databases through the <a href="http://www.athensams.net/">Athens Authentication service</a>: a dropdown list identifies titles that your Athens subscription entitles you access to.</p>

<p>One facility not offered by any of the toolbars is that provided by the <a href="http://www.openly.com/openurlref/">OpenURL Referrer for Google Scholar</a>. This extension adds a link from a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> results page to an OepnURL resolver (so the electronic text version of a journal paper, for example, may be linked to from the results page).</p>

<p>And one extension I haven't seen yet, but that shouldn't be too hard to implement, would provide a link from an ISBN to a copy of the book (if it has been scanned in/uploaded yet) on <a href="http://print.google.com/">Google Print</a>.</p>

<p>All the toolbars described offer overlapping functionality, though with some differences in terms of usability/layout. Non-toolbar extensions too offer functionality that could be included as partof a library toolbar extension.</p>

<p>Several questions now occur to me:</p>

<p>- what functionality should a library toolbar include?<br />
- to what extent should the toolbar be customisable by the user in terms of layout and/or functionality?<br />
- to what extent would a generic toolbar - customisable by a user for searches on a particular library - be useful?<br />
- to what extent would a generic toolbar - customisable by a library IT specialist for searches on a particular library, and redistributed by the library itself - be useful?</p>

<p>All comments, thoughts and Trackbacks on this topic will be much appreciated...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://libeprints.open.ac.uk/">OU Library e-prints repository</a> is still taking its first faltering steps. Hopefully over time it will come to  be used as a matter of course for lodging electronic versions of published academic papers produced by OU researchers.</p>

<p>The <a title="Stanford Graduate School of Business: Jackson Library: FastJack" href="http://wesley.stanford.edu/library/toolbar/">Stanford Graduate School of Business: Jackson Library: FastJack toolbar</a> is one of the more comprehensive library related toolbars I've found.

<h3 class="title">OUseful Firefox Library Toolbar 0.1</h3>

<p>A couple of days ago, I <a title="Tony Hirst: Scoping an OU Library Firefox Toolbar" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/003008.html">Scop[ed] an OU Library Firefox Toolbar</a>, so here's just a quick post to blog the upload of my first attempt:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ousefulLib_0.1.xpi">OUseful Library toolbar v0.1</a>.</p>

<p>Download the script then <em>File Open</em> it, or drag it directly into, Firefox and it should install itself (though you'll have to close <em>all</em> open Firefox windows and restart it to actually see the benefit, as is commom to all Firefox extension installations).</p>

<p>It's not pretty - and it's not that clever, more of a testbed and play around with the sorts of things that are described in <a href="http://www.borngeek.com/firefox/tutorial/">Jonah Bishop's Firefox Toolbar Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I need to do some thinking about just what sort of thing can sensibly be included  on a toolbar - just having a surrogate bookmark list is not making best use of the space, I think (though it does give an organisation a continued presence in the presence even if they're not at your site). Tools like the <em>Library Lookup</em>, which can be applied to lots of pages, are arguably more useful; and I guess login helpers cut out login hassle...</p>

<p>Anyway - more on that another time. Here's a quick overview of v0.1 of my OUseful Library Toolbar:</p>

<p><strong>Searching...</strong><br />
By default, if you type something in the search bar and hit return it will be treated as a keyword search on the Voyager catalogue. Hitting the <em>Voyager Search</em> button is an alternative to hitting <em>Return</em>. You can also use the term as a keyword search on ROUTES - just select the ROUTES option from the drop down list by the <em>Searches</em> button.</p>

<p>The searches actually employ <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/#redirects">OUseful redirects</a> - I always knew they'd come in handy!</p>

<p><strong>Shortcuts</strong><br />
To the left of the text box is a drop down menu that provides links to the OU Library, Voyager catalogue and ROUTES homepages.</p>

<p>The Librarians on Call button takes you through to that service (though I'm not sure if the URL is a persistent one...?),</p>

<p>If you click on the <em>Library Lookup</em> button when you are looking at a particular book in Amazon, you can see if it's in the OU Library catalogue...:-)</p>

<p><strong>To Do</strong><br />
Very obvious things on the to do list are:</p>

<p>- rewrite the code so it's not so obviously ripped, cut and pasted from the tutorial...<br />
- more (and neater!) graphics on the toolbar;<br />
- better layout;<br />
- fix the drop down history list in the search text box;<br />
- preferences for <em>My Library Record</em> and <em>MyOpenLibrary</em>;<br />
- preferences for additional libraries to <em>Lookup</em>;<br />
- town/postcode search for local, OU affiliated libraries, with route planning info based on user preferences (e.g. home/work postcode);<br />
- work out how to pull an RSS feed equivalent from a search into a <em>Live Bookmark</em> like menu;<br />
- generate an RSS feed by scraping <em>My Library Record</em>, so it can be fed into a Live Bookmark.</p>

<p>Shame I have no time to play on this again now for at least a fortnight :-(</p>

<h3 class="title">Scoping an OU Library Firefox Toolbar</h3>

<p>Having blogged about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002978.html">adding the OU Voyager library catalogue as a Firefox search option</a>, I started reflecting on the other library tools and services I've doodled with in the past, with a view to scoping out what might go in to an OU Library toolbar. So what follows is a short, incomplete, and time-hopping history, followed by some thoughts on what I'm going to put into my first Firefox toolbar...</p>

<p>Way back when, before I got my head round Firefox extensions, I tried to simplify the way I accessed the OU library catalogue by setting up the URL rewrite:<br />
 http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/library/<em>keyword</em<br />
to search the OU voyager library catalogue for a particular keyword.</p>

<p>(By the by, here's the Apache snippet that does the rewriting:<br />
  <em>RewriteRule library/(.*) http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=$1&Search_Code=FT*&CNT=22 </em>. If you want to know more about the make up of the actual search URL, I blogged about it here: <a title="Tony Hirst: Hacking Voyager URIs" href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002775.html">Hacking Voyager URIs</a>. If the whole concept of URL rewriting is new to you, then check out this posting by <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/urlrewriting.html">Russ Shannon on <em>URL Rewriting</em></a>.)</p>

<p>I seem to remember the actual rewrite was inspired by <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">Jon Udell's <em>Library Lookup</em> bookmarklet</a> which lets you look up a book in your local library if its ISBN appears in the URL of the web page you're looking at (as it does, for example, when you are looking at a book on Amazon).   For your covenience, here's a copy of the OU Library lookup bookmarklet if you don't already have it: <a href="javascript:var%20re=/([\/-]|is[bs]n=)(\d{7,9}[\dX])/i;if(re.test(location.href)==true){var%20isbn=RegExp.$2;void(win=window.open('http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?SAB1='+isbn+'&BOOL1=all%20of%20these&FLD1=ISBN%20(ISBN)&DB=local&CNT=25','LibraryLookup','scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=575,height=500'))};">OU Library Lookup Bookmarklet</a>. Just drag the link onto your bookmark toolbar, then clck it when you're looking at a book on Amazon, for example...</p>

<p>- <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/ROUTEScraper.php">ROUTES RSS feed</a>, which can be used as the basis for a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks">Firefox Live Bookmark</a>;<br />
-  <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog/googlescholaropenurls.xpi">OU Resolver Google Scholar extension</a> which adds OpenURL 0.1 buttons to the results of a search in Google Scholar (based on an orginal extension written by <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~pbinkley/gso/">Peter Binkley</a> and simnce largely superceded by the much more usable <a href="http://www.openly.com/openurlref/">OpenURL Referrer for <em>Google Scholar</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, there are quite a few other library related add-ins for Firefox floating around in the wild, such as the <a href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=337&vid=1115">Athens toolbar</a> (<a href="http://www.athensams.net/news/toolbar161104.html">tell me more...</a>).</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the <a href="http://wesley.stanford.edu/library/toolbar/">FastJack: My Library Toolbar</a> from Jackson Library, Stanford, doesn't appear to have made it out in the wild (yet...) for Firefox looks pretty useful and perhaps suggests some functionality for an OU Library toolbar...</p>

<p>So - what's on my wish list for just such a thing that is short term achievable (i.e. I more or less know how to do it already...;-):</p>

<p>- catalogue keyword (at least) search (Voyager, ROUTES);<br />
- OU targetted OpenURL markup added into Google Scholar results;<br />
- MyAthens toolbar functionality included;<br />
- OU Library Lookup bookmarklet;<br />
- automatic sign in to <a href="http://myopenlibrary.open.ac.uk/">MyOpenLibrary</a>.</p>

<p>It would also be cool if the results of a ROUTES search (e.g. via the RSS feed generated from my OUseful ROUTES search) could also be fed into a live bookmark menu :-).</p>

<p>More thoughts will foloow, perhaps in a post with version 0.1 of the toolbar :-)</p>

<p><br />
<em>PS [note to self] - build a tool that makes looking up <a href="http://www6.open.ac.uk/librarydatabase/">libraries near me</a> easier to use, e.g. by town or postcode search, or by checking out a cookie (or even MyOpenLibrary preferences...).</em></p>

<h3 class="title">OU Firefox Search Plugins </h3>

<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchplugin.js"></script></p>

<p>Some people, it seems, just don't get Firefox... Presumably they didn't get the idea of Mosaic when it came out either, and steadfastly refused to use any search client other than Veronica. I can just imagine them arguing instead that  <a href="http://www-personal.si.umich.edu/~calz/gopherpaper.htm">gopher</a> would never be replaced by fly-by-night protocols such as <em>http</em>, for example...</p>

<p>Anyway...one of the reasons <em>I</em> like Firefox is that it allows me to muck around with the browser, as well as the web pages. As soon as I get my head round writing XUL plugins, I'll have a go at an OU Firefox toolbar... But that'll take a bit of learning time, I think, so here's something simple to start with - a couple of plugins to the Firefox search tool.</p>

<p>The Firefox search tool provides a text box that allows you to fire off a query to your search engine of choice. The default is probably Google:</p>

<p><img src="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/images/fbshot04.png" alt="Firefox search tool" /></p>

<p>You'll also notice that you can add alternative search engines as the focus of your search.  The <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/">Mycroft</a> project has dozens of examples (though not the OU - yet ;-)</p>

<p>The <em>Mycroft</em> site also provides a wealth of information about getting started with writing Firefox search tool extensions, so I thought I'd knock a couple up that link into the OU search engine andf the OU LIbrary catalogue. And here they are:</p>

<p>- <a href="javascript:addEngine('ousearch','png','Academic')">Open University Search Engine</a></p>

<p>- <a href="javascript:addEngine('ouLibsearch','png','Academic')">Open University Library Catalogue</a></p>

<p>If you follow either of the above links in Firefox, you should be offered the chance to add the corresponding search engine to the list...  However, the plugin may not appear until you shut Firefox dwon and then restart it...</p>

<p>Next stop - an OU toolbar (or should that be <em>tOUlbar</em>?! ;-)</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Update 20/5/05</strong><br />
Another search plugin - <a href="javascript:addEngine('ouPublicKNsearch','png','Academic')">Open University Knowledge Network (Public Site)</a></p>

<h3 class="title">Hacking Voyager URIs</h3>

<p>In a previous post (<a title="Tony Hirst: Embedding RSS Search..." href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/002674.html">Embedding RSS Search...</a>), I described a screenscraper for the OU Voyager library catalogue that produces an RSS feed of the search results. </p>

<p>The scraper was very crude and gave a fixed number of search results, which (as the someone in the Library pointed out!) was all a bit contrived. As indeed it was....</p>

<p>So here's a new Voyager catalogue scraper that allows you to decide how many search items you want reporting, 3 in this case from a keyword search on <em>technology</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSSNum.php?q=technology&num=3">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSSNum.php?q=technology&num=3</a></p>

<p>It's quite refeshing that the screenscraper accpets limited compound search queries, for example on multiple keywords such as <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/OUVoyagerScraperRSSNum.php?q=technology+internet&num=5">technology+internet</a></p>

<p>But that's not really the point of this post. What I wanted to log here was a few things I've found out about how to construct Voyager queries in the address line.</p>

<p>A bit of playing with the <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local">standard Voyager catalogue search interface</a> can be used to generate URIs to search result forms very easily, but reverse engineering the switches can be a laborious task. Picking apart the web form to see how queries are in principle constructed is another possibility (I generally  use the Firefox web developer toolbar <em>Forms</em> tools for this sort of forensic activity) but again, it can be time consuming.</p>

<p>Tinkering around with the form led to a couple of interesting constructions, such as:</p>

<p>- class mark search, e.g. <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?SC=CallNumber&SA=6.31">http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?SC=CallNumber&SA=6.31</a></p>

<p>- ISBN search, e.g. <a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=50">http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=50</a></p>

<p>With a bit of playing, it's easy to see what some of  the switches do, and how they can be added to other searches.</p>

<p>For example, it's easy enough to work out that adding <em>CNT=<strong>nn</strong></em> limits the number of search results returned to a <em>maximum</em> of <em>nn</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to tinker with te URIs generated from the web form search, here are a coupleof pointers to making  apersistent URI (the ones automatically generated in response to making a query through the web form are often littered with session information):</p>

<p>a) Edit the URL to remove the information beginning with PID.  The PID, SEQ, and HIST numbers identify the search as belonging to a specific user session.  Leaving them in will get you a time-out message rather than search results.</p>

<p>b) Add "DB=local&CNT=25" (or CNT=10, or whatever) to the end of your URL.  This tells the computer which database to search and how many hits to display.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of queries I managed to deconstruct. The v1/v2 switch changes the reporting level (setting v<em>n</em>=0 is the same as not including it) and SID=1 appears to do the same job as DB=local:</p>

<p><a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v2=1&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=10&SID=1">http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v2=1&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=10&SID=1</a><br />
<a href="http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=5&DB=local">http://voyager.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&Search_Arg=0849304563&Search_Code=ISBN&CNT=5&DB=local</a></p>

<p>There comes a point in playing, though, when sometimes you just want to cheat and look up what a particular switch does without having to try all the options. And this guide to <a href=" http://www.ilcso.uiuc.edu/Web/Docs/webvoy_url_builder.html">URL-Launched Searches in ILLINET Online in WebVoyage</a> does the job admirably.</p>

<p>The makers of Voyager also produce guidance, I think, but I haven't been able to see it... I do have a URL though (<a href="http://support.endinfosys.com/cust/voy/downloads/ppt/Sess10Bloom.ppt">Voyager crib sheet</a>), so if anybody can get me a copy of the actual document, I'd be very grateful :-)</p>
