<h3 class="title">Search Hubs and Bounded Search</h3>

<p><a href="http://datamining.typepad.com">Matthew Hurst</a> has just written an interesting post about <a href="http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2006/03/strategic_idea_.html">Google's (lack of) GUI innovation</a>, which suggests that:</p>

<blockquote>Google doesn't own any other search interface innovations, so if they started using new ideas here, they would expose themselves to risk from every other search engine out there. There would be a feeding frenzy on the next UI brand. By keeping their interface simple, they force the competition to compete with their brand.</blockquote>

<p>I think there's something to this, but I also think that users like the simple life. For example, Yahoo keeps coming out with interesting innovations that don't seem to get widely adopted. A case in point? I was intrigued by <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/">Y!Q Contextual Search</a> when I first heard about it, installed the <a href="http://yq.search.yahoo.com/publisher/firefox.html">Y!Q Firefox <s>toolbar</s> extension</a> etc. but do I use the functionality? Nahhhhhhh...it's easier just to use the search box on my browser toolbar. After all, that's where I usually go to search.</p>

<p>The area that has been particularly interesting me for a bit is <em>bounded search</em> - that is, search within a limited range of web pages or domains.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://rollyo.com">Rollyo.com</a> for example, where you can essentially define a search roll of sites to search. It's the sort of thing <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> could offer too, or any of the other 'lensing' sites like <a href="http://h2obeta.law.harvard.edu/">H20 Playlists</a>, but I don't think it/they does/do (see <a href="./005493.html">here</a> for more).</p>

<p>In an attempt to clarify my thinking on this, I've started mulling over the phrase <em>search hub</em> (rather than <em>searchroll</em> for example) to see what it suggests to me (one of my favourite brainstorming techniques is to invent a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:neologism">neologism</a> and then unpack it/see what it suggests or brings to mind).</p>

<p>So for example, in a variety of recent doodles, such as <a href="./deliSearch.html">deliSearch</a>, and <a href="./005899.html">Search Pagelinks</a>, I've considered using a feed of delicious bookmarks, or the links on a page, as the set of resources over which a search should be applied (I guess <em>search set</em> or, recalling the above, <em>search lens</em>, could also be used instead of <em>search hub</em>?)</p>

<p>(Hmm - I'm also reminded of the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/popupLinks.html">popup linkset</a>(?) script, (effect described <a href="http://micro-info.blogspot.com/2005/12/tooltip-links.html">here</a>), and the <a href="http://phoenix.open.ac.uk/~Tony_Hirst/searchLink.html">searchLink</a> code, both of which I really need to get working ptoperly, tidy up, sort out the styling etc., and make useable... )</p>

<p>What's the point? Well, I'm working on it. Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be doodling some elearning activities that make use of <em>search hubs</em> or whatever they end up being called, both faculty and student created - and posting related thoughts to the OUseful blog, of course - so if anybody out there is working on/using something similar, please email me.</p>
