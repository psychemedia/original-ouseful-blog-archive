<h3 class="title">I think you may be interested in this...?</h3>

<p>This post - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/05/were_playing_your_song_persona.shtml" id="open_article.61642093.52" target="_blank">We're Playing Your Song: Personalised Track Notifications over XMPP</a> just caught my on on the BBC Radio labs blog: "Just a little XMPP toy: send the message <i>lastfm yourlastfmusername</i> to radio1@hug.hellomatty.com and we'll ping you when one of our music stations is playing a tune by an artist you like to listen to. Fun, huh?"  </p>

<p>It goes on: "Behind the scenes I'm pulling your last.fm profile via <a href="http://tastebroker.org/">tastebroker.org</a> which wrangles it into APML. This means I'm storing your preferences in a way that should work as well for speech shows as it does for music. So I could use tastebroker's view of your del.icio.us feed to let you know when Radio 4 is broadcasting something you might be interested in. But that's for another time..."</p>

<p>A quick visit to tastebroker reveals that it can prduce APML from last.fm, Pandora and delicious... the delicious generated APML from my delicious account is a weighted list of tags I have used, as far as I can tell...</p>

<p>Anyway, some time ago Martin was "imagin[ing] what would education (or even just a course) be like if it was built around something like Last.fm, would it be a Last.uni?". Maybe this is another step along the road?</p>

<p>Just by the by, I wonder - is there a simple hack to use a transformed APML file as a  generator for Google <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html#5">custom search engine definition file</a>, or maybe a beter question is, what's the best way of using an APML file to seed a Google CSE?</p>

<p>This is typical of the sort of thing you find in a Google CSE definition file:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/cse_file.html#5" title="custom search engine refinements"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2473370410_b4f4925177.jpg" alt="Google CSE refinements" height="251" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>And here's a snippet of APML based on my delicious habit:</p>

<p><a href="http://tastebroker.org/" title="My delicious APML (fragment)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/2473374006_fe1146d4ce.jpg" alt="My delicious APML (fragment)" height="84" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The transformation from one to the other is trivial at a technical level, and there are maybe some appropriate mappings too... For example, APML concept keys could map on to labels, and concept values onto boost weights?</p>

<p>In fact, I think the labels would need to be defined as BOOST terms in a the &lt;BackgroundLabels&gt; part of the CSE definition...</p>

<p>Aaarghhhh, I really need to get back into CSEs - they are seriously powerful, (especially now I think I 've twigged how to nest them...!;-) I'm sure we could build some really crazy course and degree based custom search engines, with a little bit of thought!</p>

<p>Also, how about this - building an APML representation of e.g. each OpenLearn unit and using it: a) to help discover related content; and b) exposing the APML as metadata to feed into recommendation services that start to use APML?</p>

<p>Enough... I've course writing to do...</p>
