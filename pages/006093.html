<div class="blogbody">

<h3 class="title">L & T Conf - Andy Lane - Open Content Initiative</h3>

<p>Why Open Content?<br />
Wide range of content forms (documents, audio, multimedia etc.)<br />
OU/BBC relationship means we have a long history of broadcasting 'open content' (free to view/consume/access, <a href="http://open2.net">open2.net</a>, OU materials in libraries etc.)</p>

<p>Open Content licensing is broader than just free to read - users can rework content etc., redistribute it, reversion it, if they share it on and acknowledge where it came from.</p>

<p>There is a Widening Participation agenda.<br />
OCI can be a testbed for elearning tools.<br />
Research and evaluation of the project is a significant part of the project - how do we do it, how wo people engage with the materials.</p>

<p>OCI may be a way of drawing materials in from other organisations.</p>

<p>OCI structure - ready to go materials in one store (the 'showcase site'), active reworking and remixing of materials in another area ('Playspace site')</p>

<p>'Showcase site' - chunks of open educational resource (3-15 hrs study time of self-contained material, labelled at a given HE level, 80% study time, 20% learner thinking time). Will contain samples of OU material.<br />
Chunks also grouped to form 'courses', all at same HE levle [?hmmmm - not sure about that  - what about modules offering progression across/up levels?]</p>

<p>900 hrs at launch, 5200 hours by 2008</p>

<p>"Playspace site" - supported open sensemaking site for creators<br />
Library of learning objects<br />
Course creation and management tools<br />
Archived course material, loosely chunked/less structured<br />
Material form other developers</p>

<p><em>Implications for teaching:</em><br />
creation of envts and opportunities from which and in which to learn<br />
Resource based learning with interactivity<br />
Tuition and support separate from content<br />
Different versions of same content for different contexts.<br />
Curriculum design in content rich environment (how to remix from 3rd party content).<br />
?Are we moving more to service (assessment and support) and away from tuition/content delivery</p>

<p>Prediction (guaranteed!) that on day 1, in October, material will be pulled out of the playspace site and translated into other languages. (?so surely there should be localisation areas of playspace that are  based around different languages? Wil the environment be localised into different languages?)</p>

<p>Implications for Learning:<br />
Need to judge an appropriate mix between , pedagogic support that is built into materials (e.g. SAQs), personal support (reflection, learning style), peer support/social networking, professional support<br />
Importance of social computing in facilitating support/interaction<br />
Co-creation of learning experience (?and self-creation of 'courses' - ?people who used this also used that? ?how can we track/reflect links/pathways between small chunks that users create themselves?) <br />
Educator as 'learning broker' cf. travel agent (I can assemble my own package holiday, or I can go to a travel agent and get them to help me.)</p>

<p>Floor (Josie Taylor) - content has always been available, but 1) structured learning hasn't followed. What's going to be different in the OCI/OU site? and 2) Some students are likely to flourish and be driven by assembling their own teaching and learning strategy by assembling groups of chunks.</p>

<p>Floor (Niall Sclater) - of content is ubiquitous/widely available, how can we continue to justify the expense involved in producing out high quality OU content?</p>

<p>In the marketplace, there are people who aggregate effectively and become well regarded/trusted as a result (e.g. influential blogs). One OU advantage is that we know how to assemble content into courses.</p>
