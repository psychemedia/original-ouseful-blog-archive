<h3 class="title">Marc Eisenstadt Moves On...</h3>

It's been an expensive week for us for cars: both have been in of attention this week, and I've just got back from giving our local garage several hundred quid... I also suspect from a tweet from Marc Eisenstadt (Eisenblog)...
<!--
<p>It's been an expensive week for us for cars: both have been in of attention this week, and I've just got back from giving our local garage several hundred quid...</p>

<p>I also suspect from a tweet from Marc Eisenstadt (<a href="http://eisenstadt.wordpress.com/">Eisenblog</a>) last night that he'll been spending the first day of his retirement at his local garage...</p>

<p>So it goes... Marc's leaving do was today, and whilst I couldn't make it in to MK, I did manage to catch the event via a KMi Stadium webcast.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I had been there, here's a couple of thing's I'd have recollected...</p>

<p>My first memory of Marc was when I was interviewed for a PhD place in HCRL, the OU's Human Cognition Research Lab which predated KMi. I think I got the post because I mentioned I had spent the previous couple of years as a band promoter, with my spare time spent in the York University library reading the AI literature.</p>

<p>Whilst I didn't really know Marc that well in HCRL, I do remember the atmosphere being a friendly one. After one particular summer school, Hank Kahney effectively became my mentor, and some could say, my fashion adviser... ;-) </p>

<p>From what I recall, Hank's last - unfinished - project was looking at standardising assessment marking, where he realised that getting non-subject matter experts to look at a script and just give it a mark based on how good it looked was actually more consistent than getting experienced tutors in the subject to mark the scripts according to an 'agreed upon' marking guide! (Hank also used to do a great summer school talk explaining to students how to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. One slide showed two poles and one disc, with the hint condition: "move the disc from one pole to the other":-)</p>

<p>In the final year of my PhD, HCRL upped sticks and became part of KMi. Only a couple of us were left behind in that move, and I've spent the 10 years or so since then trying to find a way in ;-)</p>

<p>When I returned to the OU after a couple of years as a postdoc, Marc's was one of the friendly faces to say hi to (I used to go visiting friends there for coffee quite regularly). We also crossed paths in the strangest of places - like a wet summer's day at the Eden Project in Cornwall, for example...</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hockeyshooter/58999219/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/31/58999219_d573647525.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" style="" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>In the last two to three years I've chatted to Marc increasingly regularly, first by email, and now more and more via IM. I never really grokked IM, but Marc's persistence in evangelising it - and the presence technology around it - finally paid off!</p>

<p>Marc's openness to ideas is one of the reasons why this OUseful.info blog exists - and why many of the half-baked ideas reported in it appear at all. His 'just do it" attitude is going to be sorely missed in the OU I think?</p>

<p>I'm also going to lose a wonderful internal source of useful info... Marc is one of the great evangelisers of KMi technologies, so with his departure, I don't know who I'm going to have to talk to now to find out what cool stuff is going on over there... (that said, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/">Alex Little's blog</a> is shaping up nicely ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway - here's to you, Marc - sorry I couldn't be there in person to toast your retirement; it's been a privilege bouncing ideas around with you, and I hope you keep in touch. Maybe if you're sailing around the Solent, we could meet up for a coffee or swift half?;-)</p>

<p>PS Marc - does that totally black keyboard of yours have a single key that generates multiple exclamation marks at one press!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<h3 class="title">Making Your PDFs Pay, (and PS Next Stop - Last.uni?)</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2074620598/" title="pdfAds.png"></a>I got really excited today by the widely reported news item that Yahoo and Adobe were teaming up to provide <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/adsforpdf/">ads for PDF</a>...</p>

<p>I imagined containers within the PDF document that would be populated with Yahoo ads at download time, ad selection coming from both content analysis of the surrounding PDF text, and personalisation based on <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's ad platform</a> knowledge of the person downloading the document.</p>

<p>Just like widget containers on your site that allow third party sites to pipe their advertising to your page (giving you a percentage commission on any revenue they generate from that placement) I imagined the platform dynamically injecting ads directly into the PDF document, or at least, adding them into Adobe Acrobat/Reader views of the document.</p>

<p>But it's not like that at all :-(</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/2074620598_2492c1e76a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="281" width="500" /><br />
 <blockquote>When a recipient opens a PDF document from a commercial publisher participating in this program, ads will be dynamically matched and displayed in a panel adjacent to the content. The publishers are eligible to be paid for valid clicks on the ads. Adobe has partnered with Yahoo! to provide ads across a broad range of categories to match PDF content. Since the ads come from Yahoo!, publishers do not have to establish and maintain direct relationships with advertisers. </blockquote><br />
Never mind... the thought was amusing while it lasted ;-)</p>

<p>PS by the by, the 'container ad insert' model scales in all sorts of other directions too. I remember hearing a podcast some time ago (I can't find it now :-(, in which podcast pioneer Doug Kaye was taking about the production pipeline for <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> podcasts. Textual metadata was used to pull in audio production credits at the top and tail of a podcast, and there was also a mechanism (I guess?) for pipelining in audio ads. This was all done offline, I think, (although maybe the ad inserts were regenerated/updated every so often to keep them current?). If anyone knows of a white paper - or other write up - about the architecture of that platform, I'd appreciate a link...</p>

<p>PPS having mentioned IT Conversations, I guess I should also mention the <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/">Conversations Network</a>, "a listener-supported non-profit podcast network brought to you by a global team of passionate audio/video producers and editors." As well as <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> (where you can catch many of the talks presented at the various O'Reilly conferences as well as Jon Udell's <em>Interviews with Innovators</em>), they produce <a href="http://mc.conversationsnetwork.org/">Media Conversations</a> (which carries Future Talks, "an interview-style program with futurists Glen Hiemstra and Gerd Leonhard") as well as a couple of other channels...</p>

<p>What might be of even more interest to OUseful.info readers (or at least Martin, who dreams of <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/03/lastuni.html">Last.uni</a>) is the Conversations Network <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/tutorials/tutorial-queue/">CN Recommendation/Queue System</a>:<br />
<blockquote>personalized recommendations are based upon your ratings of other programs you have heard combined with how other members have rated the same and additional programs. If [a recommended program] is a program you'd like to hear, you can play it immediately, download it to your computer, or add it to your Personal Program Queue (PPQ) for later listening.</p>

<p>The contents of your PPQ can be delivered as a podcast. Think of your PPQ as a playlist over which you have complete control. You can add and remove programs from the playlist and change their order. And because it's a podcast, you can subscribe to it in the same way as you can subscribe to other podcasts. The only difference is that you have no control over what's in the feeds you get from most podcasters; you get what they want you to hear. But with The Conversations Network PPQ, you can subscribe to a podcast that contains precisely what you want to listen to.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, your PPQ podcast feed contains the programs in your queue. Every other member has their own PPQ podcast feeds containing the contents of their own queues. (Yes, you can share your feeds with others, even non-members. You control the playlist for your friends and family.)</blockquote><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/itconversations" rel="tag">itconversations</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pdf" rel="tag">pdf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ads" rel="tag">ads</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/last.uni" rel="tag">last.uni</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>A few posts ago, I posted a link to a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011971.html">3D visualisation of a video clip</a> that allowed you to navigate within a video sequence in a novel way. I just came across a more traditional looking tool on the Yahoo research site going under the name of <a href="http://timetags.research.yahoo.com/hackdayuk/">Yahoo Timetags</a> (the link is to a tagged version of the Yahoo London Hack Day):</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2311/2073784082_2a6d7cb6e2.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="325" width="500" /></p>

<p>The interface allows you to find particular sections of the movie via tags, which are displayed in the right hand, sortable column.</p>

<p>Another in-video search tool I came across last week is the <a href="http://web.sls.csail.mit.edu/lectures/">MIT Lecture browser</a> (here's a review of <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19747/?a=f">how it works</a>):<br />
<blockquote>a web interface to video recordings of lectures and seminars that have been indexed using automatic speech recognition technology. You can search for topics, much like a regular web search engine. If any results look relevant, you can play the video starting at the relevant point and see the synchronized transcript.</blockquote></p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2073810736_616e2638fb.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="296" width="500" /></p>

<p>This tool has transcribed  a large number of the MIT OCW lectures and lets you search within them, deep linking once again into particular points within the video.</p>

<p>For educational use, where students may want to find and replay particular sections of a video several times, both of these approaches look attractive, and I'd suggest are far more useful than just sticking the content up on Youtube (although putting stuff on YouTube content does have certain advantages, like the ease with which you can produce mashups like my own version of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010633.html">UC Berkeley Lectures on Youtube, via Grazr</a>). </p>

<p>Video search aside, I've been wondering what sorts of circumstances there are under which we might be able to provide our students with 'enrichment' audio/visual content (I'm thinking - old BBC TV and radio programmes here). That is, programmes that are sort of related to a course, but not required viewing in order to complete the course.</p>

<p>A common question at this point is - "but <em>why</em> would students want to watch it if they don't need to for the course?" My answer to that is that presumably some of our students watch TV and/or listen to the radio, anyway, and presumably some of them are actually interested in the topic they are studying - and might watch related programmes out of general interest if they knew they were on.</p>

<p>And then it struck me - changes in broadcasting mean that the broadcast schedule is starting to be replaced by the viewer's personalised schedule. And as viewers/listeners take ever more more control over their leisure time viewing schedule, it provides us with ever more opportunities to slot in enrichment content into those personal schedules that might support - or provide a wider context for - issues covered in particular courses.</p>

<p>For example, I'm working on a course on computer gaming, and it could be interesting to offer students the option - in their own 'leisure' time - of watching the BBC documentary on the <a href="http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/ICFD336L">History of Tetris</a>, or listening again to <a href="http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/SECOND+LIVES">Second Lives</a>, which was Radio 4's Book of the Week earlier this year. (Linking up with someone like audio book download specialists <a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/">Audible</a> might also be interesting?)</p>

<p>The OU's Broadcast Strategy review has already gone in, I think, but I'm not sure it considered the extent to which we might become a "scheduler" or "recommender" of full length archival, broadcast content based around the topic areas covered in a particular course.</p>

<p>The effect of this would be to wrap carefully selected informal content around our formal offerings, and provide a culturally immersive wrapper around a course that would provide enrichment, broaden the student's appreciation of their course (hopefully) and help reuse high quality archival material we have access to.</p>

<p><br />
PS I just picked this up from <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/11/29/excellent-debate-visualizer-at-nytimescom/">Jon Udell's blog</a>: a <a http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&id=12086&blog_id=1149href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/11/28/us/politics/20071128_DEBATE_GRAPHIC.html#video">US Presidential debate analyzser from the NY Times</a>. Well worth a look... It reminded of this <a href=http://neoformix.com/2007/TranscriptAnalyzer.html">Presidential debate transcript analyzer from Neoformix</a>, too...</p>

<p>Jon also mentioned the <a href="http://flashmeeting.open.ac.uk/memo/">transcript analysis tool available in Flashmeeting</a>, which I probably should give a quick plug to...? ;-)<br />

<!--
<p>Who's responsible for fixing broken links on an intranet website? Not the visitor, that's for sure - but how often <em>are</em> you made to feel responsible, as if the broken link was in some way <em>your</em> fault..?</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I clicked on a link from one OU intranet page to a page on another OU subdomain (for example, it went from "intranet.open.ac.uk/thisPage.html" to "iet.open.ac.uk/thatPage.cfm").</p>

<p>The link was broken, so good citizen that I am I reported it to the owner of the <em>second</em> page telling them where I had found the broken link in the first place.</p>

<p>My thinking was this: if the page existed once and was moved, a permanant redirect could be put in place; as we all work for the same institution (?!), the owner of the second page can tell the owner of the first page where the link should point to; the error page was horrible and made it look like maybe the error was my fault - maybe it could be replaced with something friendlier? And finally, the error page told me to report the error, although it didn't provide an email link or a form to make that reporting easy...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2088/2068995702_432b3ada11.jpg?v=0" alt="IET unfriendly error page" /></p>

<p>The response was as expected  - "the link's not ours, so it's not our fault. I'll pass it on to the page owner, harrumph".</p>

<p>I just tried the original intranet page again, and the link on it is still broken (it's the link to the CREET website on this <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/strategic-research-investment/#p4">intranet page</a>; hovering over the title of the Centre <em>looks</em> like it's a link, but it isn't; the link is below the centre description ;-). The error page is a little friendlier now, and if you're into such things, you'd notice it as a <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/custom-error-page-tips-designate-the-pages-you-hope-no-one-sees/">customised 404 page</a> ;-) It also includes a link to report the error (so I did.... again...)</p>

<p>Now I know that there are all sorts of issues about what to do with error reports like this, but I can't believe there isn't a better way to try and repair broken links on an intranet - or inter-intranet (you know, a set of internal, inerconnected networks within the same organisation).</p>

<p>When the server receives a request for a page, and it can't find the page, it generates an  internal error that can be used to present the user with a particular error page, which may be humourous, or may be pretty bland.</p>

<p>It can also tell whether the request came from a user clicking on link on another web page, as well as the location of that page. So it could in principle generate a report for the owner of that referring site telling them that one of their pages contains a broken link, and would they like to chat about it...</p>

<p>Or of course, you could just let the links continue to rot...</p>

<p>A recent flurry of posts in the OU blogosphere (<a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2007/11/what-mailbox-li.html">What Mailbox limits reveal</a>, <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=91">Your mailbox is over its size limit!</a>, <a href="http://openpad.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/email-must-go/">email must go!</a>) about overflowing email mailboxes - the result of a multiway sharing of document we all happen to be working on as a part of an internal innovation project - reveals not so much about the nature of email, but more about how we use <em>documents</em>.</p>

<p>The problem is this - a team of ten or so are commenting on a document; with images, changes and comments, the file size is about 10MB large. Whenever anyone makes a change or comment, the edited doc is mailed round - again - to everyone on the circulation list.</p>

<p>Comments made to a document that becomes a the 'live' version - i.e. the one that gets edited and passed around - get to be seen repeatedly, each time the document is opened; commenting in an email message itself may or may not be read, may or may not be integrated into the document; which makes posting that sort of comment a risky strategy...<br />
   <br />
Does anyone else see the flaw in this approach? Passing the document around for edits and commentary by several people?</p>

<p>For example, why aren't we using something like Google docs or Zoho Writer (especially given that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/11/25/zoho-writer-now-lets-you-edit-documents-offline/">Zoho Writer now lets you edit documents offline</a>...).</p>

<p>In the post <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/document-vs-web-document/">Document vs Web Document</a> on the Zoho blog, the following image appears:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1271/800317748_94e4d1adf2.jpg" align="middle" /></p>

<p>(Collaboration around online, web documents is further explored in the post <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/web-apps-collaboration-the-big-picture/"> Web Apps &amp; Collaboration: The Big Picture</a>.)</p>

<p>The actuality, of course, is that <em>several</em> instances of each version of the document are created and downloaded from email attachments by each recipient.</p>

<p>For a couple of years now, I've thought that something like wikimail, or officemail was a possibly useful innovation in this area. Maybe it's <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005488.html">an idea worth revisiting?</a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wikimail" rel="tag">wikimail</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/email" rel="tag">email</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20officemail" rel="tag"> officemail</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Facebook - What is it Good For? "Absolutely Nothing - Say it Again..."</h3>

<!--
<p>Alan writes, as Mr Angry, in a <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=96#comment-115">comment to a post</a>: "Facebook is another matter, but I can't see much educational value there anyway (beyond marketing) - for God's sake leave students some social spaces without trying to stalk them and shove learning down their throats!"</p>

<p>He also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/SOTI/%7E3/189469846/im-confused-about-coursefeed.html">picks up on</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5243732877">Coursefeed</a>, an app that displays your course feeds from the Blackboard VLE in Facebook.</p>

<p>From the Coursefeed app page:<br />
<blockquote>Browse your courses, post messages to the class, share notes - all without ever leaving Facebook. CourseFeed also alerts you when your professor posts announcements, tests, or content to your course. And you'll get alerts when classmates post to the course wall and share notes.</blockquote>There are several things going on here, I think. One relates to delivering information feeds and course news items raised in Blackboard to you in Facebook. This may or may not be useful. Another relates to sharing information between students on a course. Without exploring the app, I'm not sure whether this means discussing a course within the app itself or linking back to the VLE.</p>

<p>What the app does show (if it works as advertised) is how the back end of an institutional system may be integrated (to a limited extent) with a 'portable' widget/app front end in a space like Facebook. One question then is - can the information contained within Facebook - that is accessible to the app developer - be used to add value to the VLE-in-Facebook widget, in such a way that: a) doesn't upset the users; and b) fits in with the way users want  to use Facebook.</p>

<p>One of the key constraints we imposed on ourselves for the development of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Course Profiles Facebook App</a> (which allows you to add a list of courses you have taken to your profile, find other people who have taken the same course, and link through to OpenLearn content for that course, where it exists) was that we would not exploit any privileged access to OU backend systems. For example, we would not expose an information that could only be accessed via OU authentication. This was "enshrined' in our stated belief that anyone should be able to build the app...</p>

<p>The Coursefeed app has indeed been built "by anyone", but it requires that institutional credentials be submitted via the app to gain access to a particular VLE. I haven't chatted to Liam and Stuart about this, but my preference is that Course Profiles won't take that route either. I don't want to be in a position where Course Profiles is accessing information that isn't either: a) publicly available; or b) declared to the app by the user.<br />
   <br />
Another key tenet behind the development of our Course Profiles Facebook app was that it should leverage those portions of the social network graph that Facebook exposes to applications. For example, by seeing the public 'friends' network of an individual, we could add value to it by essentially creating personal 'course groupings' based around which of your friends is on the same course as you. By mining the Course Profiles data, the Facebook "social graph" can be enhanced by adding adding additional edges between people who have declared the same course, and so on. An exciting feature in development as more people add the app and declare courses is that we can now start to offer course recommendations along the lines of "users who declared this course also declared that one..."</p>

<p>A quick glance at the OU Network on Facebook shows many students have created groups for courses they are studying. Many of these groups only have a handful of members - who were potentially friends anyway? Or they may have been established by people looking for friends on a course.</p>

<p>What the formation of groups suggest to me is that some students want to create their own break out spaces where they can talk about a particular course outside of the university context (maybe because their VLE doesn't allow student created groups, maybe because they don't like the environment the institution offers, maybe because the setting is "too formal").</p>

<p>Within the Course Profiles app, we have enabled a comment/discussion area that provides a 'pre-created" space for people who have declared a course to talk about that course (or take anything, really - we don't moderate the spaces). In fact, you don't even have to declare the course to be able to comment about it (although you do need to have installed the app) - you can just hack the URL to get in (the comment areas are keyed by course code).</p>

<p>Declaring a course within Course Profiles this immediately provides you with access to two course groupings: a) your friends who have installed the app and declared the same courses as you; b) via "Find a Study Buddy", anyone who has installed the app and declared a particular course (subject to them setting appropriate privacy settings).</p>

<p>What I guess I'm trying to say is that tools like Course Profiles are not intended to 'push learning', but they are intended to support social learning activity, through supporting the discovery of like-minded people and facilitating discussion with them. For a distance learning institution like the OU, this social support can play an important role in addition to the 'official' support offered by the institution.</p>

<p>By making available links to OpenLearn material through the app, we allow users who might be considering taking a course to inspect some of the material released from it into OpenLearn - discussions with the OU library helpdesk suggested that course materials inspection prior to a course was a common request.</p>

<p>What is perhaps surprising is that in recent years, the OU hasn't been aggressively innovating in this area, compared to years past; (the OU has been running online conferences to support courses for years, for example...)</p>

<p>I just (belatedly) picked up an email from Mike at Grazr, letting me know that Grazr will now display embedded Slideshare presentations...</p>

<p>Here's how one looks... The screenshot shows an embedded <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast">slidecast</a> - so you get the audio too :-)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2199/2057331027_1a1a83cbb9.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="333" /></p>

<p>The Grazr widget will automatically embed the slideshow when a Slideshare RSS feed is passed into the widget.</p>

<p>(Grazr is generally pretty good about embedding media components that are included as feed enclosures, as my <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010741.html">RadiOBU</a> widget demonstrates.)</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:400px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=helvetica&view=o&theme=gloss_silver&file=http://www.slideshare.net/rss/tag/seriousgames" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?font=helvetica&amp;view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://www.slideshare.net/rss/tag/seriousgames"></script></div>

<p>So what does this mean? Well, it's maybe one step closer to a personal, portable, learning content delivery widget?</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to share a coffee and a quick chat <a href="http://tidalblog.blogspot.com/">Peter Miller</a> at the JISC CETIS do earlier this week, and picked up a new lens to look at Second Life with...</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sylvar/103400643/" title="Phoropter"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/35/103400643_d4aac67f2d_m.jpg" alt="Phoropter" height="181" width="240" /></a></p>

<p>(The scarey optician's gadget is called a phoropter, apparently... I was actually just looking for a box full of lenses..)</p>

<p>Anyway, the idea is to use Second Life as a stage, rather than a meeting place, and use it to create artefacts that can be brought into a learning activity (whether that's a lecture, or a VLE session!)...</p>

<p>I also wondered whether worlds like Second Life could be used to provide a setting for visualised scientific models (such as in the above movie) that would induce a sense of awe - and evoke a consideration of the aesthetic - when stumbled upon by someone wandering through Second Life...</p>

<p>There is, after all, a fine recent history of art'n'science projects...

<p>One of the things I'm starting to think about for <a href="http://openlearnigg.corank.com">OpenLearnigg</a> is how I could in prinicple start to track subscriber numbers to feeds. This is something I'll post more about later, but here's something to bear in mind whenever someone quotes "subscriber numbers" at you from Feedburner...</p>

<p>A screenshot from a post that just appeared on Stowe Boyd's blog: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/stoweboyd/wpeL/%7E3/188236322/a-watershed-at.html">A Watershed At /Message: 50K+ Views In Last 30 Days</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stoweboyd/2052541912/" title="photo sharing" target="_top"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2200/2052541912_066fef5f56.jpg" class="flickr-photo" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The screenshot appeared with a short commentary: "I noticed this morning (via Feedburner stats) that /Message has received over 50,000 views in the last 30 days, which is a new high water mark. Over 28K RSS subscribers, too."</p>

<p>Here's a similar report for <a href="http://ouseful.info">OUseful.info</a>:</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stoweboyd/2052541912/" title="photo sharing" target="_top"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2248/2052971716_dc18459d37.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="459" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>So I reckon Stowe's blog has 4 times or so the reach of OUseful.info?</p>

<p>Feedburner describe the <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/help/stats/what_is_reach/popup/">reach measure</a> as "the total number of people who have taken action  "viewed or clicked" on the content in your feed." The number of subscribers measure is described in <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2006/09/a_peek_inside_techcrunchs_100k.php">A Peek Inside TechCrunch's 100k Subscribe Milestone</a>.</p>

<p>Further commentary can be found in <a href="http://searchengineland.com/071109-090259.php">How Feedburner Adds Up Subscriber Numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst "reach" offers a more useful measure that subscriber numbers (subscriber counts are likely to be large if your feed is syndicated/prebundled with "autorecommended" feed subscriptions on some news reading services, where it is unlikely most people will look at your feed) it is subject to error - particularly if you have offline readers as <a href="http://www.contentious.com/2007/08/16/what-feedburners-reach-really-means/">What does Feedburner's "Reach" Really Mean?</a> describes.</p>

<p>Why? Well, my understanding is that the "view" measure gives a record of how many times the page has been rendered as HTML by an online client (a 1x1 pixel image is embedded in the page by Feedburner, which can then be tracked each time it is rendered). If you look at the page offline, or with images disabled, the view won't count.</p>

<p>Clicks describes how many links in the feed have been clicked through - I think...</p>

<p>I'm going to have to find some time somewhen (?!) looking at server side stats tools for feeds, I think, particularly in the context of daily learning feeds (I'm not sure what sorts of stats Yahoo Pipes offers? I need to go and check...). But then, I've said that before ("<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010550.html">Issues With OpenLearn RSS Feeds - Obtaining User Statistics</a>").<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/feedstats" rel="tag">feedstats</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20statistics" rel="tag"> statistics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20RSS" rel="tag"> RSS</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">iFuture</h3>

<!--
<p>Ever since I caught <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">William Gibson</a> reading aloud "there's no there, there" on a late night, BBC2 cultural review show, I've been enthralled by his prose. I finally succumbed to temptation last night and started reading his latest novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spook-Country-William-Gibson/dp/0670914940?tag=ouseful-21">Spook Country</a>, which I had been saving for the Christmas break.</p>

<p>Gibson is a redistributor of a future that is already here, in nascent form at least. He's also inventing the future by proxy, articulating visions of technology that his "geek readers" can go away and build. Space opera is too far away - Gibson's worlds are rooted in the labs and early adopter communities of today.</p>

<p>If the cyberspace of Gibson's earlier work is just too much like science fiction for you, even with the explosive growth in persistent, online 3D virtual worlds over the last couple of years, you can find glimpses of the future in filings to the world's patent offices.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/">SEO by the Sea</a> blog has become essential reading for me - every couple of days, a patent from one of the search companies is described in narrative form, or a commentary is made about patent trends.</p>

<p>One post that particularly caught my eye this week was <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=898">Google and Personalization in Rankings</a>. It describes a scenario in which:<br />
<blockquote>a search engine might expand your queries based upon other things that you may have searched for in the same session based upon a language model centered around the queries themselves.</p>

<p>That kind of model created for queries could also be created for searchers, who could be clustered together with other searchers who seem to choose similar results for certain queries...</blockquote><br />
I've been thinking a lot lately about how the behaviour across a "network of like minded peers" - who may or may not know each other - might be used to provide support and recommendations to a learner connected into a social platform that can identify such networks.</p>

<p>If I want to learn about a topic, I come to it with some base level of understanding which may be quite different from yours. In an OU context, you may have studied a recommended precursor course, for example, but I may not... The way I use course materials, and maybe search around them for additional supporting material, may be different to the way you approach the course, but may resemble the behaviour of other students. The language I use to construct queries on a topic may also be indicative of my level of understanding about the subject.</p>

<p>By clustering my behaviour with that of others at a similar level to me, several things become possible. Firstly, I can be paired with other people who are currently 'in the same boat'. Secondly, I can have materials recommended to me that are appropriate for my current level of understanding, based on the aggregate behaviour of people who have previously been 'at my level'.</p>

<p>My thinking is this - can behaviour of individuals across a widely spread social learning network be mined to fulfil the role of the 'more competent peer' that plays an important role in Vygotsky's description of the Zone of Proximal Development?</p>

<p>And can more competent peers be introduced to me through that network, who can help mentor me through a learning topic on the one hand, and provide a 'teach on' opportunity for them in return, which may help improve their understanding of the topic in question?</p>

<p>PS to what extent is <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/my-facebook-friends-do-my-work-for-me/">My Facebook Friends Do My Work For Me</a> an example of one sort of 'more competent peer' discovery process?</p>

<h3 class="title">OU Open Sources Moodle ePortfolio - But What Flavour is the API?</h3>

<p>Niall Sclater has been bigging up the <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=46">OU MyStuff ePortfolio</a> (it's a devil to find on the OU network if you don't know where it is, so here's a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/mystuff">OUseful shortcut to MyStuff</a>).</p>

<p>If you run Moodle, you can <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/mystuff/?page_id=4">download and install the MyStuff ePortfolio</a>.</p>

<p>For a history of sorts of the interface design, Guy Carberry blogged elements of the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/index.php?s=mystuff">MyStuff interface design process</a> as it evolved...</p>

<p>I'll try to post a review of MyStuff over the next week or two, but I need to play with it properly a bit first - first impression notables are the calendar, filetype and tag-based displays of uploaded files, plus the ability to share files with other users (but only if you know their user ID - hmm....?!)</p>

<p>However, something that isn't immediately obvious to me is how I can get my content out; that is, there is no obvious <em>Export</em> capability. Or maybe I just missed it?</p>

<p>If we were recommending a third party storage solution to students, we'd be sure to tell them to make sure they can easily export all their files in case the service looks like it might disappear. As best practice suggests that this advice should apply equally to using services from well funded enterprises like Google and Amazon, as well as 'fly-by-night' web 2.0 startups, I guess it should also apply to <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/vice-chancellor/News_3A00_Insights/News-2007/ELQ_Briefing_Note.html">public insitutions like the OU that look set to lose huge chunks of their funding</a>?</p>

<p>The developer notes for the app suggest that data migration is possible using public APIs. What these are isn't clear to me, though I'd guess it's something Moodle related. For the user, I'm not sure how this would work? (Hmm - I wonder - is MyStuff one of the components of <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=43">Moodle on a Stick</a>? And if so, does the synching work efficiently?)</p>

<p>The API issue for ePortfolios is something that I'd like to think will be shaken up by the announcement by online storage company Box.net of their <a href="http://www.box.net/info/openbox">OpenBox API</a> (see the product announcement reviews on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/boxnet-releases-openbox-platform-for-integration-of-web-applications/">TechCrunch</a> and <a href="http://www.rev2.org/2007/11/16/boxnets-openbox-revolution-in-online-file-storage/">Rev2</a> ). </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Box.net integrated their online file storage system with the ability to <a href="http://blogs.zoho.com/general/boxnet-integrates-zoho/">open word documents from Box.net into the Zoho docs online wordprocessor</a>.</p>

<p>OpenBox generalises their Zoho integration serivce by providing a storage platform that application developers can plug in to. I had something similar to this in mind when I wrote <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009692.html">ePortfolios, Distributed Storage and Personal Repository Caches</a>, where I described the current situation whereby multiple applications all offer their own local storage solution.</p>

<p>The Box.net vision now appears to be that OpenBox becomes the filesystem for the web. So for example, if you have an image file stored on Box.net, you can open it in the  <a href="http://picnik.com">Picnik online photo editor</a>, or for a word doc, edit it using the <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho online word processor</a> or publish it using <a href="http://scribd.com">Scribd</a>.</p>

<p>Presumably being able to save all your images, documents or whatever from the partner services back onto Box.net is only a matter of time, if that service isn't already being offered?</p>

<p>Needless to say, this sort of feature is not part of the MyStuff proposition - you need desktop apps to create, edit and maybe even view the documents you have uploaded to it.</p>

<p>One of the attractions of having a centralised file store is that your files can by shared in various combinations. The <a href="http://www.box.net/info/widget">Box widget</a>, for example, "lets you share files by publishing your photos, documents, audio, or video in a user-friendly form. You can even upload additional content at any time directly from the widget, without having to visit Box!". It'll be interesting to see if they opt in to the OpenSocial API to give the widget even further reach.</p>

<p>I have to admit I don't recall seeing an 'export all' option in Box.net, but I'm sure if they looked like they were in difficulty someone would build an 'export all' application pretty quickly on top of their API.</p>

<p>So, given the choice of using MyStuff or OpenBox, which would <em>you</em> go for?<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/eportfolio" rel="tag">eportfolio</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/online%20storage" rel="tag">online storage</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20mystuff" rel="tag"> mystuff</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Looking at the HTML source of gf the TV lesson page on which the "View ads about" dialogue appears, it looks as if the adsearch box is being served by Google...</p>

<blockquote>When I view my link unit, all I get is a small search box with the phrase "View ads about" next to it.</p>

<p>We say: You might see this happen If there is not enough text-based content on your site for us to determine its meaning, or if there is a limited inventory of ad topics relating to the content of your site. Users can then enter their own search terms into this box to view ads related to their query, and you'll receive earnings for clicks to these ads. A suggestion - you might try adding more text-based content (i.e., sentences and paragraphs) to your site to help us determine relevant topics to display.</blockquote><br />
Presumably, if enough people put in similar adsearch words, the Goog will use that information to start serving ads in the normal way.<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/adsense" rel="tag">adsense</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">Course Analytics - Prequel</a>, I made a first stab at distinguishing between <em>course analytics</em> and <em>Academic Analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Here's where my thinking's at now... (the terms are subject to change...)</p>

<p><em>eLearning analytics</em> is the collection, visualisation and interpretation of electronic data collected in the context of eLearning activity. <em>eLearning analytics</em> covers the analysis of data collected from two main sources:<br />
<ul><li><em>Academic (or Student) analytics</em>: "[the use of] data from sources such as a course management system (CMS) or a student information systems (SIS) [that] can identify at-risk students through analytics and predictive modeling" (<a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB6101.pdf">EduCause report on Academic analytics</a>);</li><br />
<li><em>Course analytics</em>: the application of website analytics data collected from student use of online courses for the purposes of "optimising"  the design of online courses.</li></ul><br />
<em>eLearning analytics</em> are concerned with helping us understand the behaviour of <em>individual students</em> (academic/student analytics) and <em>individual courses</em> (course analytics).</p>

<p><em>eLearning analytics</em> are one particular class of <em>education analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some more <em>education analytics</em>.</p>

<p>Within an institution, the aggregate behaviour of individual students taking individual courses to complete a particular degree gives rise to <em>qualification analytics</em> (for example, <a href="http://csintra1.open.ac.uk/IETCoProf/CprRptSelect.asp">IET course stats</a> (internal OU users only). These stats describe user populations on individual courses, along with details of the other courses taken by students on a particular course.   To a certain extent, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook app</a> is allowing to informally collect approximations to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">this</a> <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011622.html">sort</a> of information.</p>

<p><em>Qualification analytics</em> may provide the basis of a course recommendation engine.</p>

<p><em>Curriculum analytics</em> refer to the curriculum design and are not really analytics (though they may be thought of almost as "offline" qualification analytics). A more appropriate phrase may be the curriculum graph (or qualification graph?) which underpins the qualification analytics. (What I'm struggling for here is a way to capture the sense of my earlier courses and quals visualisations (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010472.html">here&gt;</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010499.html">here&gt;</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010501.html">here&gt;</a> and<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010502.html">here&gt;</a>).</p>

<p><em>Qualification analytics</em> may also be collected at a national level, e.g. by agencies such as <a href="http://www.ucas.com/figures/index.html">UCAS</a>, and describe degree choice across UK HEIs year-on-year. These analytics may play a role in <em>planning statistics</em> used to predict course numbers on future courses.<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/analytics" rel="tag">analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/course%20analytics" rel="tag">course analytics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20elearning%20analytics" rel="tag"> elearning analytics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>In the previous parts of this series (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010927.html">prequel</a>), I have looked at <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010957.html">Visitor Behaviour</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010973.html">When Are Our Students Online?</a>. In this part, I shall briefly review user activity around assessment. The 10 week course is assessed by a short, multiple choice computer marked assessment 5 weeks in, and a more substantial written end-of-course assessment in the final week.</p>

<p>Measuring activity based on the number of pageviews, we see spikes in activity  - as indicated by pageviews - just prior to the two assessment deadlines (the assessment dates were midnight on Tuesday June 5th and midday on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2033964880/" title="CMA PageViews"></a>Tuesday July 10th).</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2117/1727702520_4a4d90c605.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="348" width="500" /></p>

<p>The Top Content Summary paints a similar picture:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2370/2033268923_74935c5833.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="229" width="500" /></p>

<p>The 'course assessment' page links to both the CAM and the ECA. Here's how students navigated to - and from - that page.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2026/2033161343_048231d86e.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p><br />
<h3>The CMA, deadline Tuesday June 5th</h3>If we define reports that display pageview activity for just the pages relating to the CMA, we see a peak in activity around the time of the CMA submission date&nbsp; -&nbsp; Tuesday June 5th - students are completing the assessment at the 'scheduled' time.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2074/2033964880_3068cca0eb.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="202" width="484" /></p>

<p>What is quite surprising is the short average time spent on page; it would be useful to be able to plot the actual distribution of time spent on this page to see whether there is a blip at longer durations.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2034072048_84f410aa43.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="179" width="500" /></p>

<p>It would also be useful to know how many people printed off this page.</p>

<p>A summary statistic identifies the pages from which the users directly reached the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/2033966336_0f0b1006fc.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="235" width="431" /></p>

<p>We see a high proportion coming from the Course Assessment page, as we might expect, but also from the front page and the course calendar, as well as the precursor teaching material (Lesson 4, Conclusion).</p>

<p>We can check the entrance to the CMA page from the Navigation Summary report, which also describes where users went after leaving the CMA page.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/2033162053_e8ce71f597.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="283" width="500" /></p>

<p>The high percentage of exits - people who left the site from this page - is worth noting. A quarter of students completed the assessment (or printed it off, maybe, and then left the site.</p>

<p>By setting the CMA page as a goal, it is possible to use Google Analytics to further break down the path users took to reach the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2016/2033966096_2deb6eaae7.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="370" width="500" /></p>

<p>The {entrance} denotes the point at which users entered the site. We see quite a high proportion of users entering the site and going directly to the CMA page (that is, not going via any teaching material pages).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2033161343/" title="Assessment Page Navigation Summary"></a><h3>The ECA, deadline Tuesday July 10th</h3>The same pattern of behaviour is observed for the end-of-course assesssment: there is a peak in activity (as measured by pageviews) in the few days leading up to the ECA cut-off date, around the time the ECA is scheduled in the course calendar:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2080/2033964656_46179d74c9.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="148" width="500" /></p>

<p>Looking at the daily breakdown of visits to the ECA page in the immediate run up to the ECA (the cut-off date was  midday on Tuesday July 10th), we see a peak of activity on the Sunday and Monday immediatley before the Tuesday cut-off. There also appears to be a significant amount of ECA related activity on the previous Sunday (July 1st).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2033968346_054ad3b608.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="289" width="500" /></p>

<p>Once again, the average time on page result does not appear to be that useful, although it may be possible to correlate or otherwise combine it with other, visitor data sets?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2217/2033162903_fcfb520fa3.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="262" width="500" /></p>

<p>The list of originating pages mirrors that found for the CMA page:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2033163809_0cf3911663.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="244" width="410" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
The Navigation Summary breaks this down further, and again shows a high proportion of exits:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2033163299_58e177bf9a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p>By defining the ECA page as a Goal page, we can tunnel into the navigation path leading to the ECA page in a little more detail:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2120/2033163633_4ebdf3d81c.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="364" width="500" /></p>

<p>Once again, we see a short path between site entry and reaching the ECA page - students are coming to the site to specifically engage with the assessment material.</p>

<h3 class="title">Access Level Notebook is Not Up to OUr Spec...</h3>

Marc has been raving over the last couple of days about the RM Asus miniBook (product details) a sub-200 quid notebook computer that runs Open Office and Skype, and has preloaded links to webmail sites, Google docs, Wikipedia and more....
<!--
<p>Marc has been raving over the last couple of days about the <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/2007/11/08/the-truth-about-the-asus-eee-rm-minibook/">RM Asus miniBook</a> (<a href="http://www.rm.com/HE/Products/Product.asp?cref=PD1024415">product details</a>) a sub-200 quid notebook computer that runs Open Office and Skype, and has preloaded links to webmail sites, Google docs, Wikipedia and more.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/personal-computing/tech.shtm">OU Personal Computing Specification</a> requires students to have a Windows machine, which effectively means the Asus "Access level machine" is not an option for our students...</p>

<p>Also in the news is the recent announcement of <a href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/news/132308">fast growing Apple Mac computer sales</a>. I can see why this makes sense - after all, if the only apps you run are iTunes, chat, mail and Google (i.e. a browser), then why not opt for a Mac? What does Windows give you?</p>

<p>So is it time to call time of the <em>required</em> use of Windows machines? What are the barriers to platform independence for us?</p>

<p>One major issue for the OU in particular is that we ship quite a lot of software to students. Specifiying an operating system makes this easier to achieve (although in principle using Java should offer a degree of operating system independence; going forward, Silverlight and Adobe Air might also be interesting in this respect?)</p>

<p>Chatting to John Naughton last night, I asked about the history of the OU Personal Computing Specification/Requirement, hoping it had originally been defined at a functional level (unfortunately, it wasn't).</p>

<p>Maybe it's time for us to start thinking about what an appropriate functional specification should be (the listing on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007985.html">OLA DVD</a> could be a useful guide in this respect?)...</p>

<p>...and selecting software for future courses that are either platform independent  desktop apps, or that run from the cloud through a browser...</p>

<p>Now I wonder, is <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=43">Moodle on a Stick</a> tied to Windows?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/platformindependence" rel="tag">platformindependence</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20asus%20minibook" rel="tag"> asus minibook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/access" rel="tag">access</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>What beautifully sweet irony - Niall Sclater has just posted <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/?p=45">Downside of the small pieces model</a> about SlideShare being down, and comments:<br />
<blockquote>Of course institutional sites go down too - but it's our business to keep them working and at least if services are hosted in-house we can pull out all the stops to ensure they're fully functional.</blockquote><br />
So I thought I'd log in to the intranet and build a quick scraper to alert me from a status page that I think exists on there somewhere about any OU server outages...</p>

<p>...only I can't get in...</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2089/1953693748_e6050f828a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="276" width="500" /></p>

<p>And I get the same error when I try to log in to my student page (must be an error with the SAMS single sign on  authentication system)?</p>

<p>Now this may or may not be a problem with my browser (Flock).... but how do I know? I'm using Flock successfully with a whole range of other websites at the moment - and my internet connection is fine... hmmm... [UPDATE: not a cookie problem - seems to be working now, an hour or so later... but I do notice the Bloglines plumber is out... Maybe there's a bug going around?!]</p>

<p>If it was SlidesShare, I'd mail the developers...with the OU - I guess I can try that <em>Email us</em> form, but I don't hold out much hope...</p>

<p>PS SlideShare seems to be back up now, anyway... :-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Profiles Facebook App - Number of Courses per User</h3>

<p>Although the number of users has grown since I last took a dump of users stats (as "reported" in <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">OU Course Profiles Facebook App - Treemaps</a>), I'm still tinkering with the original dump of 700 or so anonymised user records from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Open University Course Profiles Facebook application</a> to see what other low hanging fruit there is in terms of graphical reporting we can explore.</p>

<p>After chatting with Jon Rosewell yesterday about the commenting frequency of students in the Open Studio application on T189 (of which, more in a later post, maybe?) I thought I'd have a quick look at the distribution of the number of courses declared by Course Profiles app users.</p>

<p>Here's the distribution curve...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2287/1951798756_ef86e3537f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="364" width="470" /></p>

<p><br />
The shape looks kind of familiar, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Here's the data sorted into log (ish;-) ordered bins:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2281/1951798498_126b581828.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="238" width="500" /></p>

<p>I'm not sure what the status of the users who entered a single course code is? Maybe they are students on their first course, or on a single OpenLearn course, or maybe they are just trying the application out?</p>

<p>And I'm not sure how to best to dig into this sort of data... are there any 'standard' ways of reporting 'power law' data, I wonder?</p>

<p>Hmmm - maybe it's time to start looking at some formal academic reporting... now I wonder, what were my Science Direct credentials again? Where in the library website can I find a way into the citation databases? Ah, buggrit, as someone in a Terry Pratchett book probably once said - I'll use <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>...</p>

<p>PS I tried Google Google first of course - <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/im2006a.pdf">The Future of Power Law Research </a> by Michael Mitzenmacher (Internet Mathematics Vol. 2, No. 4: 525-534 ) looks like it might be quite interesting, although it isn't exactly what I was looking for...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/stats" rel="tag">stats</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/statistics" rel="tag">statistics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20analytics%20facebook" rel="tag"> analytics facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20fbapp" rel="tag"> fbapp</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20course%20profiles" rel="tag"> course profiles</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>Sarah Horrigan's <a href="http://kindalearning.blogspot.com/">Kinda Learning Stuff</a> has been kinda doing it for me over the last few weeks, and so I've <a href="http://edublogawards.com/2007/2007-nominations/">duly nominated</a> it....</p>

<p>Sarah's latest post - <a href="http://kindalearning.blogspot.com/2007/11/get-out-of-myspace.html">Get out of MySpace!</a> - picks up on something that keeps being restated (that students don't necessarily want their teaches invading their social spaces) with a bit of personal commentary:<br />
<blockquote>Although the idea of life-long learning is a laudable one, we all have different versions of ourselves which we reveal or hide according to our own choices. Sometimes we want to learn in public... sometimes we want to learn in private. It's up to us to invite people in to those private spaces - if we choose to. I'm not sure if there's an issue of respect for boundaries here or of complex power relationships which also need to be respected - but just saying 'because students like using this, they'll like using it to learn' doesn't logically follow.<br />
...<br />
I think that ownership and control over environment are important and there's something mildly uncomfortable about 'friends' from one context being introduced to 'friends' in another.</blockquote><br />
Observations like this,  of course, provide one of the drivers of the <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2007/05/04/groups-groupings-and-taming-my-buddy-list-and-twitter/">"groupings" meme</a>, which argues for social network management tools that support faceted personal profiles, as well as a <a href="http://www.lunchoverip.com/2007/02/lift07_stowe_bo.html">"me-first"</a> principle for <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/03/social_me_first.html">designing social tools</a> (how many Stowe Boyd coined terms did you spot in that sentence?).</p>

<p>One of the things we spent quite a bit of time discussing when we first came up with the idea of the Open University <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Course Profiles</a> Facebook application was the principle that we didn't want to force the application on to anyone; nor did we want to tie in to institutional student record systems and produce a 'formal' institutional application.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/1640855627_c17be99e67.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="258" width="500" /></p>

<p>The idea was simple - we would provide a tool that would provide students on Facebook with a <em>personal benefit</em> by helping them to enrich their profile with a course profiles badge that listed their OU courses, and then optionally provide them with a <em>social benefit</em> that would allow them to discover each other through that voluntary display of personal information, that is, through a shared declaration of their affiliation with a particular course.</p>

<p>The Course Profiles application is controlled by the students. It is voluntarily installed, and users decide which courses they want to declare (we don't check that they ever have studied - or are studying - a particular course).</p>

<p>Users can <em>optionally</em> discover other users who have declared a particular course using the "Find a Study Buddy" service. Personal privacy setting allow users to determine who can discover them using this service (no-one, only friends, friends and network members, or everyone).</p>

<p>Again - the user is in control.</p>

<p>We don't try to get everyone on a particular presentation of a course to befriend each other, although we can <em>help</em> users find other like-minded ("like-studying") people on the course, <em>if</em> they have declared it using the application and <em>if</em> they are happy to be found.</p>

<p>We can also show users which of their friends has studied a course.</p>

<p>(This also helps spread the application - if you know one of your friends has studied a course and can't be found via the relevant Course Profiles course action page (see the figure above), you might invite them to install the app... ;-)</p>

<p>Although we can't provide private groupings, the application interface does support the <em>de facto</em> emergence of friends groupings around particular courses.</p>

<p>I've started noticing an increasing number of student created, course related groups on Facebook, and our next dilemma is whether we try to cross-promote them from within the Facebook application. My feeling is it would be better if the group creator opted to affiliate their group with our application so that it could be discovered from the application?</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/facebook-fears-its-nothing-new/">Brian Kelly</a> suggests that institutional IT developers "need to engage with successful widely used services". Our Facebook application is to all intents and purposes a skunkworks project; the specification is evolving through discussion between ourselves and our users and whilst there are occasional hiccups and bugs discovered in the wild, we're (i.e. Liam;-) is fixing them in public with the help of the users.</p>

<p>I like to think the Course Profiles app is helping to provide a useful service - certainly, the uptake has been good; 900 users since the soft launch at the start of October. The activity is okay  - around about <s>10</s>5% active a day. We're looking at ways we might try to facilitate wider use, but we're wary of intruding...</p>

<p>PS here are some application user install stats (and an application valuation!) via Adnomics: <a href="http://adonomics.com/about/4472914735">Course Profiles app install stats</a><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/facebook" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/groupings" rel="tag">groupings</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/skunkworks" rel="tag">skunkworks</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Tracking and Trends</h3>

So my reorganised department has a new name - Communication (sic) and Systems - and we're in the Mathematics, Computing and Technology Faculty (I really don't understand the URL? hopefully it's temporary?), along with the Computing Department, the spritely named...
<!--
<p>So my reorganised department has a new name - Communication (<em>sic</em>) and Systems - and we're in the <a href="http://wml.open.ac.uk/">Mathematics, Computing and Technology Faculty</a> (I really don't understand the URL? hopefully it's temporary?), along with the Computing Department, the spritely named Design, Development, Environmental and Materials Department (they wanted to be called "Human and Technological Futures", I think?), and the Mathematics and Statistics Department.</p>

<p>As befits a deptartment that includes the old ICT and Technology Management departments, and a Faculty that includes us and the Computing department, the (ongoing) integration of our previously distinct IT systems is <em>not</em> going smoothly. The old Technology Faculty and Maths and Computing Faculties, which have merged to create the new faculty, used separate email, mailing list and conferencing systems, and reconciling them is causing the IT strategy group severe problems, I think... heh heh :-)</p>

<p>Reorganisation has also provided the opportunity for lots of new groups to help us co-ordinate our various activities (?!). One such group is a 'scanning' group for the combined Masters programme. I'm not too sure what they are scanning, exactly, (though I'm trying to find out), but here are some of the things that I pay (partial;-) attention to that I would class as scanning activity...<br />
<ul><li><em>technology trends scanning</em> - (i.e. what should go in our courses 3-5 years down the line?  the UK gov <a href="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/horizonscanning/">Horizon Scanning Centre</a> occasional publishes some interesting stuff, and the <a href="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/HORIZON_SCANNING_CENTRE/FANclub/Index.html">Futures Analysts' Network (FAN Club)</a> regularly have get togethers (not that I've ever been able to get to one...); I personally sign up to alerts from some of the <a href="%20http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/consultants">IT consultancies</a> and occasionally try to interest others in what they do (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009231.html">Harnessing New  Technologies</a>);</li><br />
<li><em>competitor scanning</em> - why can't we do almost anytime start courses, like <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/lifelong_learning/distance_learning.htm">Liverpool</a>for example (I spotted that from an ad on Technorati!);</li><br />
<li>policy tracking - that is, IT and technology policy, rather than skills etc.; e.g. the <a href="http://www.pitcom.org.uk/">Parliamentary Information Technology Committee</a> and <a href="http://www.egovmonitor.com/">eGov Monitor</a> are on my feed subscription list;</li><br />
<li>job tracking - e..g <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/">IT Jobs Watch</a> is a fun way to spend a coffee break once a month;-)</li><br />
<li>student numbers - our strategy and planning office presumably produce briefings (?), IET publish lots of stats, (and the new <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">Facebook app stats</a> may also be worth casting an eye over every now and again? ;-);  <a href="http://www.ucas.com/about_us/stat_services/">UCAS</a> publish annual statistics about HE degree uptake - I keep wondering whether I'd get into trouble if I uploaded their data to Many Eyes?</li><br />
<li>watching the funders - <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/">HEFCE</a>, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>, and the <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> are the ones I keep a weather eye out for - though I rarely approach them. I should probably pay a little more attention to <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">BECTA</a> too...</li><br />
<li>And of course, you can't beat good old immersion in the blogosphere either ;-) When we were scoping Click On series 2, I set up an <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/subscribe.php?preconfig=5d6d79ac409c195e34780586f97233a8">ICT tech news'n'blogs watch page on Netvibes</a>, which provides an at a glance view over a quirky sampling of the IT news space! I have to admit I prefer the river of news view I get daily in my feedreader, though...</li></ul><br />
What really strikes me is that scanning is about being sensitive to the flow and dynamics of what's going on, picking up signals from the ongoing chatter, rather than infrequently sampling from the deluge...</p>

<p>Groups are all very well, but this sort of thing needs an ongoing conversation... it strikes me that subscribing to feeds is a good way of supporting this sort of activity... and as we all know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010271.html">We Ignore RSS at OUr Peril</a>.<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rss" rel="tag">rss</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/horizon%20scanning" rel="tag">horizon scanning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20futures" rel="tag"> futures</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>After a month or so of light blogging while he was away, Martin has just posted some <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEdTechie/~3/181083647/a-lexicon-for-t.html">linkbait</a> to try and recover some of his lost technorati ranking points (can you <em>guess</em> what a <em>twintle</em> is before you read jhis post? ;-)</p>

<p>This 'floating of terms' is something I was having a sideways think about earlier today... I'd been writing up some notes having read the OU's Broadcast Strategy Review (<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/cau/broadcast-strategy/">internal link</a>) and couldn't really unpack from that document what they thought broadcasting was (there's a philosophical treatment on the nature of broadcast on the website...)<br />
 <br />
So here's my first pass attempt at a definition of the 'new broadcast':<br />
<blockquote>a means of transmission/publication within which the marginal cost of distributing content to additional consumers of that content tends towards zero, and the marginal cost to the consumer of receiving additional broadcast materials, having acquired the broadcast receiver and, if necessary, paid for access to the carrier, tends to zero</blockquote></p>

<p>Invoking <em>marginal cost</em> tries to get across the idea that once the transmission equipement and receivers are in place, and a free carrier exists between them, there is no cost to adding more consumers of the content that is being broadcast, and no cost to receiving more content, unless payment is required to access the content. (There may also be a distribution/carrier cost - such as the fee for your broadband connection. But if it is 'unlimited' use, it's marginal as you consume more content).</p>

<p>There's a little more jargon in there that needs unpacking - this is based on something I scribbled 5 or 6 years ago now - a 3 layer model incorporating content, channels, and a carrier.<br />
<ul><li>at the top level is content: content refers to the actual programme you are watching - Friends, say;</li><br />
<li>at the middle level is the channel: the channel here refers literally to the programme channel providing the programme you are watching - Sky One, for example;</li><br />
<li>at the bottom level is the carrier: the carrier refers to the means by which the programming is delievered to your television set - cable, satellite, terrestrial broadcasting etc.</li></ul></p>

<p>There's lots of issues with the 'definition', (and the 3 -layer model...) such as that it admits all forms of content rather than just audio and video transmissions; but on the upside, it does accommodate novel distribution channels, including viral ones (where the consumers themselves become part of the transmission apparatus).</p>

<p>Things like newspapers are ruled out of being a broadcast medium (it costs to print another newspaper), but admittedly the whole of web publishing IS admitted ;-)</p>

<p>Scheduling (and to a lesser extent, simultaneous viewing) is another feature of the traditional broadcast view, but what that allowed was discoverability of known item content. Search and other navigation techniques, as well as syndication feed subscription models, meet the same need?</p>

<p>Viral transmission is interesting - here the consumers become part of the transmission and discovery system. Viral marketing is also similar to 'water cooler' discussions about last night's tv, except in this case if you missed the thing being talked about , you CAN go and watch it and become part of the discussion. So i don't have to preempt my viewing to be able to chat with you - we can negotiate the content we are going to talk around...</p>

<p>I bounced the definition passed <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/marc/">Marc</a> (I don't think he liked it much ;-) but he did suggest I could try it out by adding it to the Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>...</p>

<p>I have to admit I hadn't thought of this (nor did I do any 'research' looking up definitions of the term - I just made something up that helped me think about scalable distribution) but Marc's comment did make me realise that to date, the only real Wikipedia contributions I've made have been to fix the odd typo and revert the occasional page to get rid of spam.</p>

<p>So here's the question - if I wanted to try out a radical redefinition of broadcast on Wikipedia that was fit for th 21st century media landscape, how should I go about it? </p>

<p>Make a change to the actual entry page, or go into the discussion/Talk page and float the idea there?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wikipedia" rel="tag">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/broadcast" rel="tag">broadcast</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Course Content Image Search</h3>

<!--
<p>I'm not sure whether this is something I've posted before, but it sort of came up in conversation today... The context was an informal chat about how difficult it can be trying to reuse elements of previous OU course materials, in particular richer media assets such as video or audio content, and even images. And one reason for that is the problem of content discovery...</p>

<p>Search in the OU could work better (as I've hinted many times...! - e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010430.html">oops</a> (almost 6 months on and the same thing <em>still</em> happens...) and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010689.html">ha ha</a>) but at least our media asset search tool isn't broken - because I don't think we have one... the <a href="http://diva.open.ac.uk/">DiVA</a> video search tool was an experiment that appeared to stall before it got going, and the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006117.html">BBC Programme Catalogue</a> is the closest thing I'm aware of to an OU historical boradcast programme search...(hmm, which reminds me, I don't think I ever did get a reply from the Beeb about whether they had metadata around OU radio programmes so I could search for OU co-pro/fully funded radio programmes that are made available as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/directory/">BBC podcasts</a>).</p>

<p>If you're on the intranet, LTS have a <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/lts/production-process/9010_demo_list.htm">gallery of interactive  demos</a>, but no search tool, I think?</p>

<p>(It probably wouldn't be appropriate if I mentioned the apocryphal and probably not true (?!) story I heard  about how the code archive was completely broken in the sense of missing lots of code, not least because there was a time not so long ago when source code had to be deleted from a 'full' server, in preference to buying another hard disk.... oops...probably not true, as I say (, I say , I say...).) </p>

<p>Which brings me to the point of the post -  and one that I can't believe I haven't posted before - wouldn't it be good if we had something like the <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/image/">O'Reilly image search</a> tool - OU edition - for searching over images included in previous OU courses... (The O'Reilly tool searches around images that have appeared in O'Reilly books. It's good - <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/image/">try it</a>... they also have an <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/image/quiz/">Image Quiz</a> where you're shown "an image from an O'Reilly book along with four possible book titles", and "[a]ll you need to do is select the correct one";-)</p>

<p>And I wonder if AACS and LTS actually <em>do</em> have something like <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch/advanced_code_search">Google code search</a> (or even <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/code/">O'Reilly code search</a>? Though that would be maybe more useful for OU Computing students, if code from OU computing courses was avaliable for search somehow?)?</p>

<p>That said - it <em>is</em> possible to <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009229.html">search OU course materials</a> if you're signed into the OU website (I need to explore that in a little more detail, I think, because I'm not sure exactly <em>what</em> course materials are being searched over...?), and the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> website allows you to search over all the OpenLearn materials (although I have to admit that I prefer to use something like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010642.html">OpenLearn Custom Search Engine</a>;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">School Calculator Woes...</h3>

Sunday, Sunday - last week tech support, this week, school calculators... "We're just off to town to get a school calculator... do you want anything?" "What..? I thought you'd already got a calaculator? No - I KNOW you've got one..."...
<!--
<p>Sunday, Sunday - last week <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011038.html">tech support</a>, this week, <em>school calculators</em>...<br />
<blockquote>"We're just off to town to get a school calculator... do you want anything?"</p>

<p>"What..? I thought you'd already got a calaculator? No - I KNOW you've got one..."</p>

<p>"I've lost it..."</p>

<p>"Did you try looking for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes - for two hours" - read: 10 minutes, if that...</p>

<p>"And I NEED one -  I couldn't do my homework last week..."</p>

<p>Looks around the living room, where there are currently three laptops, one desktop PC and a Wii with browser enabled; and a mobile phone...</p>

<p>"But there are calculators all over the place - HUGE ones..."</p>

<p>"But I need it for SCHOOL!"</p>

<p>"You just said it was for homework... What was the homework, anyway? Pick any one of these computers and I'll show you how you could have done your homework on it...in several different ways, probably..."</p>

<p>And so it goes...</blockquote><br />
What struck me thinking back over <em>that</em> little episode was the role of calculators in maths education. I can see there is a role for using calculators to demonstrate mechanical calculation, and maybe help scaffold ideas about algorithms and precision; and I can see the affordability and portability of calculators means that they are accessible to the majoority of school kids.</p>

<p>But when as the last time <em>you</em> used a calculator? When I need to "do sums" I use <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/calculator.html">Google as a calculator</a>, the Windows calculator, a spreadsheet, or a bit of Javascript... I guess my phone may hava simple calculator too?</p>

<p>When calculators first arrived, they were a boon (?) to maths education. When the first affordable computeres arrived, school Maths departments started teaching elementary programming (this will date me: who remembers the <a href="http://www.doyouremember.co.uk/memory.php?memID=2233">BBC Model B computer</a> in school?)</p>

<p>From what I can tell, now we have large scale computer suites in most schools, no one teaches programming... and the majority of kids who are forced into using calculators in school in their compulsory maths lessons would have <em>no idea</em> about how to use a computer to do the same thing... even using the Windows calculator or Google...</p>

<p>On a similar tack, the other day I came across the Mac <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapher">Grapher</a> application, which lets you enter equations and plot the corresponding graphs in 2D or 3D; some of them are really beautiful... I don't know whether schools have "produce the most &lt;whatever&gt; graph" using similar tools, where&nbsp; &lt;whatever&gt; could be 'beautiful', 'complicated', 'curvy' or 'wibbly', but I could see this sort of approach turning graph/equation exploration into a game...</p>

<p>...I can even imagine a social "graph-plotting" site where you get to submit your own graphed equations, tag them, and rate each others...</p>

<p>Is that a "how sad is that..." sort of thing to say, or is it a way of thinking how we can leverage mild competition (read: social networks...) and aesthetic/visual sensibilities in exploring <em>how</em> equations works and how their components affect their visual representation?<br />

<!--
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to see an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">OU Facebook app</a> based around self-reported course codes was that it would give me access to data that does exist within the OU, but that I wasnlt allowed to explore using visualisation tools such as Many Eyes...</p>

<p>I'm not sure where this could lead, but here are a few snapshots of Treemap visualisations generated by Many Eyes using some raw data (approx 700 users) from the Course Profiles app...</p>

<p>Firstly, a breakdown of self-reported course start dates by year (year 0 is undeclared). The larger blocks within each year correspond to the level of the courses. The atomic (smallest) squares correspond to the declaration of a particular course by a particular registered user of the application.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1848051215_24002fbab3.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="336" width="500" /></p>

<p>A view of courses by faculty...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2412/1848874816_1a742a0308.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="342" width="500" /></p>

<p>Secondly, a zoomed in view of the Science Faculty courses - the dominant boxes within each course box correspond to the declared year of study.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2360/1848050599_2ffbdf1c3a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="344" width="500" /></p>

<p>Here is a view of courses that have been completed, are currently being studied, or are part of a users planned future study. The large inner groups within each period correspond to the level of course that has bee, is currenlty being, or will be studied.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/1848873798_df1ffcac93.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="350" width="500" /></p>

<p><br />
A view of courses by course code, then year of study...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/1848874162_7a766d2280.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="346" width="500" /></p>

<p><br />
As well as Treemaps, the data representation used is also appropriate for generating certain classes of Matrix Chart. Here we see current/future/previously studied courses, organised by level. The size of each bubble is a count of the number of people who declared it; the colour segments are breakdowns by faculty.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2134/1848875518_016202aa4f.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="376" width="500" /></p>

<p>This chart shows how the charts can be explored by highlighting levels of study, within a chart that depicts courses by Faculty and status (currently/previously and to be studied).</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2309/1849059884_9d1cf6e5bd.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="365" width="500" /></p>

<p>My feeling is that such displays offer at a glance views over large amounts of data that would allow curriculum planners in the first instance to phrase interesting questions about the data that could then be explored in more detail.</p>

<p>Of course, the same of data displayed above is based on a relatively tiny sample of OU students (700 or so) compared to the 120 thousand current students and over 2million alumni... which could generate a wonderful dataset to play with if they all joined facebook, added the Course Profiles app and let me aggregate their data... ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openuniversity" rel="tag">openuniversity</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualisation" rel="tag">visualisation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20manyeyes" rel="tag"> manyeyes</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<!--
<p>I had a chat earlier today with a couple of folks from the OU Library about what sorts of questions we could ask about user behaviour on the OU Library website if something like Google Analytics was running on that site. I didn't take any notes at the time, but here are some of the take home points I remember about low hanging fruit and potential segmentation of analytics according to perceived user groups:<br />
<ul><li>What are the most popular areas of the site? Are they reflected by the top level and front page navigation schemes used on the site?</li><br />
<li>How would a site overlay of click-thru behaviour on the front page compare with the anticipated/expected/desired behaviour?</li><br />
<li>Would analytics reveal any periodicity in activity on the website, on a daily or weekly basis? Would this mirror activity in calls to the Libray support desk, e.g. via the "Ask a Librarian" service?</li><br />
<li>Would it be possible to identify course related activity? For example, where courses include a particular library website activity, would it be possible to define analytics filters to capture evidence that this activity was being completed by students, and to what extent? Could a goal page relating to a goal state/page within the library be defined for one or more course related library activities (such as an exercise in the info skills course <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google</a>;-) allowing user behaviour leading up to that goal page being captured? What sorts of analytics might a course team be interested in receiving from the library regarding library resources linked to from a course (e.g. on a course page in Moodle?)</li><br />
<li>Library users can potentially be segmented in various ways - for example, by IP range (which would identify on-campus or regional users). Would it be possible to use filters to report on these user groups, and what use might be expected? Using an OTS analytics tool such as Google analytics, tracking users against authentication would not be possible. However, would it be possible to segment users based on their behaviour? Or could landing pages/entry pages be identified for different users - on-campus researchers, for example, as opposed to on-campus course developers and/or students, or off-site students?</li><br />
<li>What sort of search terms deliver users to the OU Library website from organic search listings and what sort of activity does those users engage in?</li><br />
<li>Would it be possible to reconcile exit page analytics (e.g. from particular database listing pages) with reports from accesses to external, licensed services? </li></ul><br />
The above list is just a first pass, of course...</p>

<p>If anyone out there is using, I'd be interested in hearing what your favourite report views are, and why... ;-)</p>

<p>If anyone out there is thinking of using Google Analytics to explore user behaviour on library websites, what sort of questions would you want to use analytics to help you try to answer?</p>

<p>How to define library website goals is another interesting exercise... If the site was Amazon, where the aim is to sell goods, a relevant goal page would be a "Thanks for the cash - the goods will be with you in a day or two" page. What is the range of useful, successful transactions on a Library website? And waht are the corresponding 'goal pages'?</p>
