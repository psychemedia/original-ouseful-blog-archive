<h3 class="title">OpenLearn on iPods?</h3>

<p>With lots of interest around the OU at the moment regarding 'Mobile Moodle', and how we take VLE content offline and into peoples' pockets, I was intrigued today when I stumbled across <a href="http://mogopop.com">mogopop</a>, a "web application designed to make it easy to create, publish and download multimedia content for iPods."</p>

<p>The premise is simple - create pages of content for your iPod, bundle it an go. As well as text pages, mogopop claims to let you incorporate audio, video and image pages in a particular bundle of pages (though with a 50MB size limit per project I suspect that will limit the amount of video you can include?)</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopProject.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopProject.jpg" width="865" height="589" border="0" /></p>

<p>As I had a spare hour or so this evening (that is, I needed a displacement activity away from marking...) I wondered how hard it would be to convert the <em>French: Ouverture</em> OpenLearn unit to a portable version...</p>

<p>The answer is rather trickier than I had at first anticipated, so much so in fact that I don't even have a demo of my own to link to :-( ... nor do I have an iPod, which means I wouldn't have been able to test it properly anyway. If anyone would like to donate one to me, please feel free to get in touch... ;-) Maybe you got a new one for Christmas...? Whatever... I can always <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/services/loanout.php">borrow an iPod from the OU Library</a>, if not...).</p>

<p>Text pages are easy enough to add:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopText.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopText.jpg" width="529" height="216" border="0" /></p>

<p>Audio uploads too seemed to work okay:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopAudio.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopAudio.jpg" width="523" height="197" border="0" /></p>

<p>The images uploaded fine, but I could never seem to save them into a page, though I could preview them:</p>

<p><img alt="mogopopImage.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/mogopopImage.jpg" width="259" height="198" border="0" /></p>

<p>I didn't succeed in uploading any video though - no matter what I tried (from following the mogopop iTunes conversion instructions, to using a variety of formats generated via the rather clever video converter utility <a href="http://heywatch.com/">Hey!Watch</a> (which will even convert files you have subscribed to via a feed :-).</p>

<p>(Thinking of that Hey!Watch feed subscription utility, it would be <em>really</em> handy if you could import a feed into mogopop and have it generate a correspondingly linked package as a result...)</p>

<p>There were significant other issues too with respect to making a (quick) sensible conversion of the actual learning materials:</p>

<p>- the large number of detailed images are actually too detailed (I suspect) for easy viewing on an iPod - and the activites wrapped around the images require you to actually inspect them quite closely;</p>

<p>- pulling a transcript out of the PDF transcript files to paste into a text page proved impossible (probably compounded by the fact that: a) I'm using Adobe Reader; b) on a Mac; c) the PDF text was very accented French, in d) a complex layout;</p>

<p>- several of the exercises are largely designed for <em>print</em> use (not even online use...), so are not really appropriate for use with a mobile screen.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough (I think) to put one of the heavier text based courses on into mogopop, but to my mind that largely defeats the purpose? Any comments?</p>

<p>Just in passing, OU readers interested in the <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/?page_id=30">VLE Mlearn project</a> can pick up an invite for three forthcoming workshops <a href="http://crassus.open.ac.uk/OUVLEMLearnProjblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mlearninvite.doc">here</a>. The themes are:</p>

<p>- Podcasting, Course News and Alerts <br />
- Mobile Course Content <br />
- Social and User Generated Content on-the-move </p>

<p>Ah... Course News and Alerts.... that <a hre="http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/microinfo/">takes me back three or four years</a>... ;-)</p>
