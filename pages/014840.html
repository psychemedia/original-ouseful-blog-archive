<h3 class="title">Uncovering a Little More Digital Worlds Structure</h3>

<p>Tweaking the Wordpress blog structure parser to get a GraphViz output was trivial, so here are a couple of snapshots for the reverses pingback graph (that is, if post B pingbacked post A, then I plot A as emergent linking forward to B).</p>

<p>So now I now have a couple of ways of looking at this stuff, what should I be looking for that may or may not be interesting...?;-)<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/structure" rel="tag">structure</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20blog%20structure" rel="tag"> blog structure</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>It is interesting (and impressive), but I'm not sure it tells you what you need to know - how do users interact with the posts to assemble their own course?</p>

<p>"but I'm not sure it tells you what you need to know - how do users interact with the posts to assemble their own course?"</p>

<p>That's part of what I'm trying to work towards... (If you know all the answers, how come you aren't sharing them?! I don't even know what questions I'm trying to ask!; In fact, if you can help shape some tiny steps answerable questions, that would be really handy ;-)</p>

<p>So here's where I think I'm going at the mo... This "work" sort of complements the course analytics stuff. What I'm trying to do is muddle towards an understanding of a 'course graph' and how various resources are connected together.</p>

<p>Using web analytics, we can track how many people click through various links, what fragments of the graph they traverse in a study session, and so on.</p>

<p>In our online Relevant Knowledge short courses, the structure of the courses are pretty linear - pages end with a 'click here to go to the next page' link, and so on.</p>

<p>In the uncourse blog, by automatically annotating pages with trackbacks, we allow multiple forward navigational paths to emerge. I suspect (but don't know for sure) that at the moment: a) not many people click through on links contained within the body of a post; b) not many click through the trackback links. However, by styling the trackback  links in a different way (e..g. to know more about x click here, for y, click there etc) "on-clicking" might be encouraged?</p>

<p>Over time, and with an active population, it would become possible to track user flow over connected posts (and potentially discover a consensus  'emergent course' from a set of resources.</p>

<p>Stephen Downes commented about by 'ad revenue' post the other day with a comment that "I conclude ... that we'll abandon the course production model." [ http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44975 ]</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to do is a) [one extreme] with course analytics understand how people currently engage with linearly authored online materials; and b) [other extreme] try to understand how we can author in a natural an emergent way non-linear 'courses'.</p>

<p>Then there are all the steps that need adding in-between and round the edges: e.g. how can we help learners find structured/scaffolded paths through non-linearly authored, loosely coupled, emergently cross-referenced resources? Is there scope for instructors putting together anything other than linearly ordered courses (problem based learning and other resource based learning approaches try to get a handle on this).</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that we can in principle track use of online resources in a comprehensive way, and come to an understanding of 'course resource graph' structures that in some sense work for learners. But I don't know how to do it. So I'm trying lots of little things out..</p>

<p>I fear that I do know all the answers, I just don't know the questions. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about it ;-)</p>
