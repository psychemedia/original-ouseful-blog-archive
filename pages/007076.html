<h3 class="title">Another Batch of Neat OU Jobs</h3>

<p>Seems like the OU is really going for it at the moment...</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2410&ref=ext"><em>Strategic Search Engine/Digital Communications Manager, Communications</em></a></p>

<p>The UK’s largest university is looking to take the leap into next generation website management by ensuring website production and information architecture issues are integrated with strategic search engine management issues (and on the reporting and definition of key performance indicators).</p>

<p>Working closely with the OU Website Coordinator you will have an in depth knowledge about web and other digital issues but your core focus will be on making the website work for the organisation – through search engine optimisation and the measurement of performance. So if you understand what HTML means but also SEO, SEM, ROI, KPI and PPC means then we want to hear from you! (And to understand the acronyms please search using Google).</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2411&ref=ext"><em> Mobile Learning Project Manager, OU VLE Development Programme, Policy Development Group</em></a></p>

<p>The aim of the OU Virtual Learning Environment Programme is to provide a top quality online learning environment for our 200,000 students and 7,700 part-time tutors. This involves a programme of development work to integrate elearning services and tools within the Moodle Open Source platform, developing new tools where necessary and promoting the use of elearning elements in OU courses and programmes of study.</p>

<p>You will lead developments to support users of mobile learning and teaching technologies, including laptops, podcasting, PDAs and other handheld devices and mobile telephones. This will involve identifying the needs of users, reviewing best practice and leading the development and implementation of new tools and services. You will lead a small multi-skilled team and be responsible for the project management, documentation and resources associated with the Project. You will be an excellent manager and communicator, have proven expertise in research and/or development of one or more aspects of elearning or online administrative services, and have a strong interest in the application of appropriate pedagogies to technologies.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2406&ref=ext"><em> Senior Programmer/Web Developer, Institute of Educational Technology</em></a></p>

<p>Are you looking for an exciting challenge delivering systems for cutting edge projects? Then read on.</p>

<p>Your key role will be lead programmer and developer for institutional and externally funded IT projects. You will focus on several concurrent projects, including working with national and international partners developing tools such as a Learning Design player, mentoring and student support system, online surveying, eLearning support and knowledge management services. Based in the Institute’s IT support team, your duties will include website and service development, and co-ordinating programming work of educational technology projects.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2388&ref=ext"><em> Strategic Systems IT Development Manager, The Open University Library</em></a></p>

<p>(I've posted this one before, a week or two ago...)</p>

<p>Do you have the strategic vision to lead the development of leading edge systems and services to meet the needs of our users in a rapidly changing learning/technological environment?</p>

<p>You will lead the Library’s strategic IT systems development by providing specialist technical advice to Senior Management. You will ensure that there is a strategic fit with University-wide systems developments by liaising with key stakeholders in the organisation as well as horizon scanning new technologies and relevant research. You will support the development of our user-centred electronic library and its integration into the University’s virtual learning environment.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I've posted these solely for your information, dear reader, and not because I am involed with any of the appointments (I'm not). As a consequence, I am not able to comment about them, really...;-)</p>

<p>If you do go for any of these posts, please mention you saw them on the OUseful blog.</p>

<p>And if you end up taking one of the posts, drop me a line...</p>
