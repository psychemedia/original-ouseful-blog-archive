<h3 class="title">OpenLearn Remix Competition</h3>

<blockquote><strong>Reuse or remix units - and win a prize!</strong>

<p>We're setting a challenge to educators worldwide to reuse and remix OpenLearn study materials. The aim is to inspire creativity, collaboration and cost reduction in course production, enabling wider access to education for all. We've launched a competition with two categories - reuse and remix. The competition aims to showcase and reward some of the best examples of this. And it is open to OU staff too!</p>

<p>So what are we looking for? And what exactly is reuse and remix? Reuse is about using our content as it is to have an impact on learners. This could be through using it in your own teaching or by delivering our content in a new medium which engages more learners.</p>

<p>Top marks will go for evidence of impact. You might use OpenLearn materials to reach a large number of users - perhaps through a social network you are part of or your own version of Moodle - or you might impact just one person but in a really critical way for their learning.</p>

<p>Remixing is about amending our OpenLearn materials to create something new. This could mean taking old archived materials and updating them by adding your own knowledge. It might mean localising our content for an audience with different cultural and language needs. Maybe you'll use our knowledge mapping software to demonstrate a new perspective on the materials. We are already sharing learning materials in XML and Moodle format and will soon be adding plain zip, IMS Content Package, html (through the "print this unit" facility) and RSS, so there are many different ways you can take our content and rework it. You might prefer to take our video or audio content and rework that.</p>

<p>There are two prizes - one for the best example of reuse and one for the best example of remix. The entry will be judged by a panel of open content experts. The winners will each receive:</p>

<p>- Some technology of their choice up to the value of £250 that will help them experiment with new methods of teaching. It can be something worthy or something fun: an iPod, a smartphone or some useful software.<br />
- Lots of attention at the OpenLearn conference 2007, where the winning entry will be showcased to experts in the field of open content.<br />
- Recognition in an OpenLearn press release.<br />
- Digital and printed stickers which can be used to announce their winning status to the world (better than an iPod any day).</p>

<p>To enter, email us at openlearn@open.ac.uk with 100-200 words telling us about your entry and why you think it deserves to win an OpenLearn award. State which category you are entering. Include a url or attachment to show your work in action if applicable and give some indication of impact or potential impact.</p>

<p>Remember to include your contact details. The competition is open to all - including Open University staff and students - with the exception of the panel of judges. The deadline is 1st October 2007. The winners will be announced at the OpenLearn 2007 conference on October 30th.</blockquote></p>
