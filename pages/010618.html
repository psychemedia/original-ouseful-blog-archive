<h3 class="title">Almost October OU Jobs Roundup</h3>

<p>As there have been quite a few interesting looking job ads released here over the last few days, I thought I'd do another update:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=3328&ref=ouseful"><em>Systems Programmer(s), Technical Services, Computing Services</em></a>: "We are looking for an experienced systems programmer to work in the Technical Services Section.

Based on Professor Keith van Rijsbergen's pioneering work in quantum-theory based framework for information retrieval, this is a joint project between the Open University, the University of Glasgow and Queen Mary University of London. The Open University will mainly focus on contributing to the development of a unified framework for the representation, evolution and interaction of contexts, implementing and evaluating the framework in large scale multimedia search tasks, such as TRECVID and INEX Multimedia Track."</li></ul><br />
As ever, I have nothing to do with any of the above, but if you're up for interview, get one of the posts etc etc, and I'm around at the time, ping me and let's go for coffee ;-)<!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/jobs" rel="tag">jobs</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
