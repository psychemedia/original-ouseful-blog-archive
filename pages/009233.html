<h3 class="title">The OpenLearn_daily Shop</h3>

<p>I've just been setting a couple more <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearndaily">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em></a> feeds up (see the <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/tag/openlearn/">complete list of  OpenLearn courses delivered via feedcycle.co.uk</a>), in particular on business topics ('<a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/feed/10295/">The Market Led Organisation</a>' and <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/feed/10290/">'An introduction to business cultures</a>') and been looking at 'easy' ways of adding further value to the feeds.</p>

<p>Here's what I've come up with so far.</p>

<p>Firstly, a link at the top of each item to the OpenLearn forum associated with the course. This is an attempt to engage readers of an OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> feed with the wider OpenLearn community following that unit.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced - usability and engagement wise - about <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> in the item to provide this link? Maybe it would be better at the bottom of a post, which is where you'd find the comment link on a blog post. Topping and tailing the post with a link to the forum is maybe overkill. Thinking about it, I'm going to move the forum links to the <em>bottom</em> of each item.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have produced an Amazon Listmania list for the books referenced in each course: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Market-Led-Organisation-OpenLearn-Unit-B700_1/lm/R19414GJV54BGB/">Books referenced in 'The Market Led Organisation'</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/An-Introduction-to-Business-Cultures-OpenLearn-Unit-B120_1/lm/R1RBG5U6SG30SX">Books referenced in 'An introduction to business cultures'</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly <em>how</em> to use this yet, but as it's relatively easy to get a feed from a list using Amazon web services, it may be worth exploring a <a href="http://stringle.pbwiki.com">StringLE</a> assembly around a course?</p>

<p>Having created the Listmania lists (which would have been easier if the books in the OpenLearn XML had been tagged with an ISBN number...) it was trivial to import them into an Amazon aStore. So here's what may become a work in progress, subject to change in at the least the styling/presentation/design, and possibly likely to grow over time: the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/openlearndaily-21/">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> Amazon Store</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment this is populated with books from just the two courses mentioned above, but as I've pretty much decided to use Listmania lists to organise lists of books associated with the OpenLearn courses I RSS/feedcycle-ify (?!) it won't be any extra effort to then add them into the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/openlearndaily-21/">OpenLearn_<em>daily</em> Store</a>.</p>

<p>The 'similar items' Amazon feature potentially adds remix value, too, and it'll be interesting to see how <a href="http://amapedia.com">Amapedia</a>, Amazon's new 'wiki review' site develops to see whether or not useful content appears there.</p>

<p>The Amazon aStore doesn't seem to offer the Amazon 'Search Inside' feature, so I'm exploring a couple of ways of getting 'search inside' like functionality into the feed content.</p>

<p>At the moment, I do this from the Bibliography (which appears as the last item in the feedcycle) by linking to either Amazon (to give something <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/1412939798/ref=sib_dp_pt/202-8194984-3619821">like this</a>), or <a href="http://book.google.com">Google books</a>  (to give something <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0750626135">like this</a>) .</p>

<p>In future, what I'd like to explore is pulling links in at the point of reference, but I'm not sure how best to do this. If it's possible to deep link into the actual page(s) referenced - using either Amazon, or Google books etc - that would be <em>really</em> neat :-) Especially if it could be done automatically. Which would require references being properly (i.e. semantically) marked up in the source XML. Which they probably aren't...</p>

<p>I don't know whether the OpenLearn/LabSpace metadata file supports the listing of at least book references (keyed by ISBN, ideally) but providing this info would potentially facilitate automatic book related remixing.</p>

<p>Similarly, a list of links to external sites would be useful, though it's easy enough to generate from the XML and is on my to do list. For a brief, preliminary discussion of <em>why</em> I think link collections are useful, and <em>how</em> I think they may be reused, see <a href="./008559.html">Making the Most of Links from Online Course Materials to External Websites</a>.</p>
