<h3 class="title">Digital Worlds Week 8, Round-Up</h3>

<p>Another slow week on the Digital Worlds front, and again I didn't find the time for the half-a-day or so of tinkering that the the Game Maker posts require:-( And next week is already looking less than promising in terms of time available for daily posting, with two days being lost to the OU Making Connections conference...</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the weekly round-up, a week in which I started looking at how games can encroach on daily life in ways you may not necessarily expect...<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/20/post-hoc-game-documentation-walkthroughs-and-speedruns/">Post hoc Game Documentation - Walkthroughs and Speedruns</a>:  this post actually got a comment about a potential family learning dimension to Digital Worlds, which is somethiong I probably need to think a bit more about...</li><br />

<li><a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/args-uncovered/">ARGs Uncovered</a></li></ul>From the blog stats/link referrers, I also picked up on some interesting links via delicious from <a href="http://del.icio.us/truna">delicious user truna</a>, (who I'm guessing may be <a href="http://www.leagueofworlds.com/when-worlds-collide">a.k.a. j. turner</a>), particularly relating to the Hero's Journey and the role of story in game development. I was actually posting about that topic several weeks ago, so it's a real issue as to how an uncourse can best accommodate 'new' material.</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/truna" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2203/2446118902_fa7d042b1c.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="Dogotoal worlds delicious referral" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>(In our traditional course production process, where materials are developed over periods of months, and even years, there is always the chance of rewriting sections before they are produced. Of course, in those traditional production methods, the discovery of new materials through people linking to your own draft materials is not a possibility if the draft materials are sitting on a personal PC somewhere, hidden away from public, or at least peer, use...)</p>

<p>Anyway, as to how to accommodate the new material - I could have produced a new post, but instead I chose to add "additional reading" comments to the original Digital Worlds posts that mentioned the corresponding topics (<a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/mapping-plotlinesand-coping-with-interactivity/">Mapping plotlines…and coping with interactivity…</a> and <a href="http://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/story-arcs-and-the-three-act-structure/">Story Arcs, and the Three Act Structure</a>).  I did consider amending/rewriting the original posts, but chose not to for no particular reason I've yet thought through...</p>

<p>I guess one way of maintaining a 'more on this subject' feed would be either to havea  special blog category or topic for posts that extend posts from much earlier in the uncourse blog, or maybe I could use and 'uncourse tutor' persona with which to post extension comments, and then produce a filtered feed of just these comments, maybe even mixing  in these comments to the main uncourse blog feed?</p>

<p>Anyway, taking the route I did - of adding comments to original posts using the same persona I've used for other chatty comments, etc., it gives me something to think about with respect  to non-linear authoring and how to author branching topic lines out-of-linear time sequence so that there is a well-defined trail through the topic for several particular audience types:<br />
<ol><li>people who have been following the uncourse blog for some time (and would have read the original annotated post at the time it was created, and therefore had an opportunity to subscribe to its comment feed if it was a topic they were particularly interested in, for example;</li><br />
<li>people who may have started following it recently (that is, since the original post);</li><br />
<li>people who happen across the post via a search engine, or link from elsewhere.</li></ol>Ho hum, always, always, each week raises more questions than it provides answers...<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digitalworlds" rel="tag">digitalworlds</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/social%20discovery" rel="tag">social discovery</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>I've got Digital Worlds feeding into my Netvibes page - but it's never occurred to me to pick up a feed for comments on a particular posting - even though I enjoy the comments and occasionally scroll down to see if anyone has added any.</p>

<p>It would be helpful if blogs had a 'Recent activity' section. It's interesting to see who has visited a blog more recently, but it would be much more interesting if the avatar pic had info beside it. 'Most recent visitor R3becca commented on Digital Worlds Week 8 round-up'.</p>

<p>I think a section for general chat would be good as well. A place where you could add comments which relate to the blog itself. Things like 'I see a connection between these three posts' or 'have you thought of posting about geocaching' or 'here's a news item everyone might like to read'.</p>
