<h3 class="title">Google Personal Web History: My Panopticopedia</h3>

<p>The all-seeing Wikipedia defines a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"><em>panopticon</em></a> as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Panopticon is a type of prison building designed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The concept of the design is to allow an observer to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) prisoners without the prisoners being able to tell if they are being observed or not, thus conveying a "sentiment of an invisible omniscience".</blockquote> </p>

<p>Several weeks ago now, Google started rolling out their <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009922.html">personalised search</a> service, which for logged in users biases your Google search results listing according to your preferences.</p>

<p>At the time it was released, the service drew on users' search behaviour to tune personal results.</p>

<p>These preferences are built up over time as Google learns about you and your online behaviour <em>however it can</em>. Originally, personal results built upon the way users used Google, and the result links they clicked through. But now <em>all</em> your online behaviour can be taken into account if you so choose:<br />
<blockquote>Web History helps deliver more personalized search results based on what you've searched for on Google and which sites you've visited. </blockquote></p>

<p>Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/your-slice-of-web.html">Web History</a> service will collect - via the Google toolbar - a history of all the web pages you've visited so that you can easily search over the places you've been.</p>

<p>(And yes - the capitalisation of <em>W</em>eb <em>H</em>istory is correct according to Gogole.  Here's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=10470&hl=en">more info about Google Web History</a> if you're interested... or scared....)</p>

<p>The usefulness of this is undeniable - how many times have you tried to relocate a page you visited last week, or last month?</p>

<p>This itch is one that prompted Joshua Schacter to scratch when he set up the <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious social bookmarking service</a>; it's also one that's addressed directly within the Flock browser, which has an inbuilt page cache, index and search utility: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006428.html">Search Browser History in Flock</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know whether the Web History service also indexes PDF files I've downloaded, though, which I could see being a useful feature. (In fact, I'd be happier letting the Goog search over the PDFs I've read, rather than tracking the sites I've visited.)</p>

<p>If you're that way inclined, you can publish your live browsing history via an RSS feed, although Google's not the only service to offer this, as for example demonstrated in this recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/12/social-bookmarking-meets-big-brother-cluztr/">review of Cluztr on TechCrunch</a>, which describes a clickstream collecting and publishing service in which "[e]very site you visit is recorded and posted live to the Cluztr site in a social bookmarking style format, but without the need for active involvement".</p>

<p>Although most of us would be uncomfortable with publicising <em>everything</em> we're doing in the way that <a href="http://justin.tv">justin.tv</a> does, there does seem to be something in the air at the moment with respect to "look at what I'm doing" apps.</p>

<p>For example, I've started feeding the 'last played' info from last.fm into my IM status line, and could imagine <a href="http"://wakoopa.com">wakoopa</a> (reviewed <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/27/wakoopa-lastfm-for-desktop-applications/">here by Techcrunch</a> (again!)) being exploited in the same way to show what desktop application I'm currently using.</p>

<p>I guess the next thing we'll be seeing are Twitter application plugins that accept a highlight-right_click-twitter_this input and let you tweet seemlessly... (Just so you know, I haven't got into Twitter - and don't intend to...)</p>

<p>Whilst Web History can be used to track out behaviour via the Goolge toolbar <em>with our permission</em>, I suspect that Google  cookies can also be used in principle to track our web useage without our opt-in permission?</p>

<p>Google has multiple ways of getting these cookies onto our machines - via Google properties themselves, via web pages with Google Analytics installed, or Google Ads, or  - soon  - banner ads from the company presumably soon to be formerly known as DoubleClick: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2007/tc20070426_612648.htm">Google go for DoubleClick banners</a>. They're also gearing up to <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/05/google_unveils_tracking_t.html">track your eyeballs as you look at outdoor advertising</a>, maybe?!</p>

<p>Maybe this is something that will become a user preference - "add to my Web History if you see me"? Presumaby it'll happen in an anonymised fashion anyway. to improve the Google search and ad-serving experience?</p>

<p>Paranoid - me? Nah... because I know it won't get as bad as <a href="http://iandavis.com/blog/2007/04/per-user-pricing-at-amazon">punitive personal pricing</a> where I have to pay more for goods the "system" knows I want...</p>

<p>Anyway - back to the point in question, which was - err...?! ;-)</p>

<p>Ah yes - collecting everything we do on the web, storing everything we see...</p>

<p>Like the  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/MyLifeBits.aspx">MyLifeBits project</a> from Microsoft - which looks at how we might organise a personal lifetime data store. That is, a store of everything we have seen, or read, or visited: a personal panopticopedia (from wp again: <em>To the ancient Greeks, Paideia was "the process of educating man into his true form, the real and genuine human nature."</em>).</p>

<p>If we limit the lifetime data collection to things we have seen and learned from, maybe we'll all end up with our own Panopticopedia... (via Google personal search, of course...)</p>

<p>"This is your web life."</p>
