<!--
<p>For several years, the OU Library have been the the <a href="http://routes.open.ac.uk/">ROUTES</a> service (Resources for Open University TEachers and Students), "a Library service providing access to selected quality-assessed Internet resources for Open University courses. Resources are selected by course teams and the Library's Information Specialists."</p>

<p>More widely, the <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/">Intute</a> service seems to be following a similar path:<br />
<blockquote>Intute is a free online service providing you with access to the very best Web resources for education and research. The service is created by a network of UK universities and partners. Subject specialists select and evaluate the websites in our database and write high quality descriptions of the resources.</blockquote>I've posted about ROUTES several times, suggesting it could be socialised, (something that is happening in pilot form with the <a href="http://testmatch.mine.nu/wordpress/?p=73">fOUndit</a> pilot on social (student) link recommendations within a course) or used as the basis for a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010189.html">Custom OU Search Engine</a> for Courses  (couscous?;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, for my final library related thought this year, how about a Library NOUS service ("News for Open University teachers and Students").</p>

<p>For each course, the NOUS team of subject and information specialists could identify a set of news feeds and keywords appropriate for a particular course (course block, or even course unit) and provide the course webpages with a live, on topic, news feed, that would help place the issues covered in the course in the wider context of current news stories.</p>

<p>Producing a Pageflakes type page (like the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk">OUseful dashboard</a>) would be another possibility, but probably overkill for the moment (although it might provide a handy current awareness tool for course alumni who were actually interested in the course subject area;-)</p>

<p>It would be even better if the feeds and filters could be student (and maybe course team) generated and maintained, but control is one of the things we still strive for (under the banner of 'quality'). And I suspect participation/contribution rates would be low anyway (it'll be interesting to see how fOUndit turns out in this respect).</p>

<p><small>Anyway, that's me probably done for the year now - the blog is likely to be quiet for the next week or two, so season's greetings to you all, and thanks for reading, if you have been :-) </p>

<p>[Normal service will be resumed in early 2008! ;-)]</small></p>

<p>PS if you're looking for a recipe over the break, why not try out the new CSE I've started tinkering with: <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3Afcmnkrf85cw">What's Cooking?</a>.

<!--
<p>If you haven't yet tried out Jing, you should give it a go....</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.jingproject.com/">Jing</a> is a an application that sits quietly in the background until you need it. It's presence is indicated by a small transparent yellow quarter circle in the corner of your screen, or small transparent semicircle sitting at the top of your screen. Hover over it, and three option tentacles appear...</p>

<p>So what does it do? Well, it's a screen capture and screencast capture tool.</p>

<p>Produced by TechSmith (who make the Snagit screen capture and Camtasia Studio screencast capture tools (<a href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2007/11/snagit-and-camt.html">older versions of which are available free</a>) that runs cross-platform and deposits your captures seamlessly into the cloud...</p>

<p>The original version of Jing forced you to save captures to screencast.com, with a license that suggested Camtasia might start charging for the screencast.com service at any time. However, the most recent version of Jing will now let you <a href="http://blog.jingproject.com/2007/11/file.html">save images/movies to your computer</a>, or <a href="http://blog.jingproject.com/2007/11/in_an_effort_to_increase.html">save your screen captures to flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Setting up the flickr synching is reminiscent of OpenID authentication. When you set up your Jing application to access flickr, your sent off to flickr, asked to log in, and then asked if you are happy to allow Jing to work with flickr. Once you agree, the process is seemless - capture windows or arbitrary areas of the screen (Mac or PC remember) and then save them to your computer or upload them to the web.</p>

<p>To get a feel for the aesthetic of the interface, here's the first capture I made that I sent to flickr:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2125802898_ec1dce2bf7.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="486" width="499" /></p>

<p>Here's the notification you receive (on a Mac at least), when an image has been successfully uploaded:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2216/2125803908_4112b51cf0.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="303" width="320" /></p>

<p>And here's what happens when I refresh my Flock media bar:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/2125029167_ccaed14640.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="227" width="243" /></p>

<p>I've used Snagit on a PC for years, and the few screencasts I've produced have been done with Camtasia studio. On the Mac I've been using&nbsp; - err, I'm not sure what - very happily for the last year or so, but as of today... Jing.</p>

<p>If I get a chance before the break, I'll try and use it to capture a quick screencast.</p>

<p>In the meantime, treat yourself to an early Christmas present, and give Jing a whirl...</p>

<h3 class="title">Thinking Aloud - a-learning ;-)</h3>

<!--
<p>A quick count of devices in our family that are: a) portable, and b) capable of playing audio files suddenly brought home to me just how accessible recorded audio is becoming from a technology point of view</p>

<p>I've thought for some time that audio could see a resurgence, and I'd be keen to know whether there are any OU course teams who are looking to use audio in a significant way in any new courses (in the past, many OU courses used to go out with audio or video content, as well as text-based print content).</p>

<p>As well as 'official' radio programmes being made available for download, the open courseware movement is turning up all sorts of audio lectures on a regular basis, and podcast networks are generating niche content - often high quality niche content - on a regular basis.</p>

<p>So I wonder - just as one OU course model is to 'wrap' a commercially available book, might we see a course that 'wraps' a series of third party audio broadcasts?</p>

<p>I can think of a couple of candidates for starters. Firstly, the entry level robotics course I am involved with comes up for revision in a couple of presentations. At the moment it goes out with a couple of books - but maybe we could wrap the <a href="http://lis.epfl.ch/resources/podcast/">Talking Robots podcast</a>, rather than a book, if the course goes to a 'second edition'?</p>

<p>Although not one of our BBC co-pros, Melvyn Bragg's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/">In Our Time</a> would make a great candidate for a cross-disciplinary foundation course (<a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=91">Stuart might take such a course</a>, I think?)</p>

<p>In Our Time is one of the programmes the BBC now makes available via a podcast, although the feeds from the BBC site only contain the current episode for 7 days after broadcast (I think). Then the content is made available from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_archive_home.shtml">In Our Time programme archive</a> via a Real Audio stream (.ram file) which means that for most people, it can only be listened to 'live' and onliine.</p>

<p>(Just in passing, here's an old demo of how BBC archive/Real Audio content can be bundled and delivered via a Grazr widget&nbsp; - <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010582.html">BBC Click On Series 1</a> (requires Real Audio player).</p>

<p>Plenty of other BBC Science and History radio programmes are archived and streamable - check out the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/archive_index.shtml">BBC Radio 4 Science archive</a> or the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/archive_index.shtml">BBC Radio 4 History archive</a> if you're interested, as well as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/directory/">BBC Podcast Directory</a>, maybe? (More generally, <a href="http://www.learnoutloud.com/">Learn Out Loud</a> has a reasonable index of educational podcasts, and <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/index.html">IT Conversations</a> is great for the geeks :-)</p>

<p>One thing that I know from my own listening habits is that I tend to get more benefit from listening to conversations than I do from listening to presentations or lectures (which often rely in part on visual aids that aren't available to me). Certainly, when given the choice of listening to a conversation from&nbsp; an O'Reilly conference or a lecture from MIT, I'd go for the conversation almost every time :-)</p>

<p>In this respect, I think it's interesting to note that podcast conversations are now starting to appear that support professional academic journals. The IEEE, for example, as several podcast series that support its magazines:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/podcasts/in_our_time&amp;file=index.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;;jsessionid=HqKKPnQ9xypNGLkb7QLS6VTz92lTMdDvDTvQyTHTHLVxGZFz4bk9%21306574509">In Our Time</a>: A podcast series devoted to some of the important recent moments in the history of computing.</li><li><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/security/menuitem.6f7b2414551cb84651286b108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=security_level1_article&amp;path=security/podcasts&amp;file=index.xml&amp;xsl=article.xsl&amp;">The Silver Bullet Security Podcast</a>: supports IEEE Security and Privacy</li><li><a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/radio">IEEE Spectrum Radio</a></li><li><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/podcasts/computing_lives&amp;file=index.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;">Computing Lives</a>: Tales from the IEEE Annals of Computing History</li><li><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/podcasts/standards&amp;file=index.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;">IEEE Computer Society Standards Speakers Series</a>: Okay - hands up who keeps up with standards? Maybe this makes it easier?</li><li><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/podcasts/top_ten&amp;file=index.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;">Top Takes on Computing Technology</a>: Listen to the most popular articles that have appeared in the IEEE Computer society journal<br />
</li></ul>You get the idea - a full list is here: <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&amp;pName=ieeecs_level1&amp;path=ieeecs/content&amp;file=media_directory.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl&amp;">IEEE Computer Society media centre</a>.</p>

<p>A few points to note:</p>

<p>Firstly, many of these podcasts take the form of an extended interview (that is, a conversation).</p>

<p>Secondly, many of them work as static feeds. That is, the content is (to a certain extent) timeless. Which is to say, it can be delivered via a daily feed to someone interested in pursuing a paced 'audio course' on a particular topic (Computing Lives or In Our Time (IEEE or Melvyn's edition!) might be a couple of such examples).</p>

<p>Thirdly, many podcasts are starting to come with show notes that back up the topics covered in a particular podcast episode, (or in the case of IEEE's Top Takes, link through to the original article), which can be used as a starting point for further 'study'.</p>

<p>PS a-learning? Audio, of course! ;-)</p>

<p>PPS <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mortarboard/2007/12/the_rise_of_the_download_dons.html">The rise of the download dons</a>:<blockquote>What's going on? Just when you thought young people today were dumbing down and feeding on a diet of "education lite", along comes a hardcore physics professor to prove us wrong<br />
Walter Lewin, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), now tops the iTunesU download chart with his blend of equations, enthusiasm and experiments involving himself. Edutainment? Well, good teaching has always involved a good dose of showmanship. <br />
...<br />
In the UK Lewin's success was foreshadowed in the 1970s by the Open University, even though in those pre-download, pre-recording days you had to watch men in flares and kipper ties explaining complicated ideas at inconvenient times of the night.<br />
<strong>The OU doesn't seem to be throwing up a new generation of academic performing stars, which is a pity because whatever the opposite of education lite should be called, it's never really gone away.</strong></blockquote> Err, in the podcastosphere (?!) <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010480.html">Nigel Warburton on Philosophy</a>, maybe?

<h3 class="title">A Fragmentary Thought on Content Reuse</h3>

I've been thinking a bit lately about open courseware reusability, so here's a breadcrumb to mark the possibly false trail I'm on... this is all thinking out loud, so may not make any sense at all... For the purpose of...
<!--
<p>I've been thinking a bit lately about open courseware reusability, so here's a breadcrumb to mark the possibly false trail I'm on... this is all thinking out loud, so may not make any sense at all...</p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, by reuse I am thinking of an educator reusing materials produced for another course or another purpose in a course they are going to deliver themselves.</p>

<p>This not to deny other opportunities for reuse. For example, reuse by students who took the course originally ("revision"), reuse by other learners ("taking the course"), and so on.</p>

<p>Reusable components are components found within collections that can be disaggregated from each other and then (re)aggregated in new ways - in new collections.</p>

<p>Reusable components are replaceable components. If you can't replace a component in your course materials with another one, then it isn't reusable. Reusable components are portable.</p>

<p>Courses have some sort of structure to them (imparted by a title, reading list, syllabus, weekly schedule), some sort of 'static' content associated with them (books, or readings, for example) and maybe some sort of delivered content (an actual lecture) and contextual/conversational content (tutorials, discussion groups, lecture Q and A). The particular structure of a course as well as the particularly content used within the course may also be considered to be part of the delivery of the course. In this sense, delivery corresponds to choices made about the course structure and content.</p>

<p>Reusable structures. The structure may be reusable. The reading list/syllabus is an index to a collection/database and has value as such. That is, the structure can provide a key for reusing by providing a way of identifying course components in an ordered way.</p>

<p>Replacement. Structures scaffold collections of components. Components are often replaceable within a structure. A course structure may be reused by replacing of the components collected around that structure with other components.</p>

<p>A component is loosely coupled to, and may be indexed by, the course structure. A component is hot swappable. A component is addressable. Many components are atomic.</p>

<p>The structure can provide a starting point for your own annotations - remixing on the theme of the course. It may be possible to do this automatically - analyse the content/components around particular course items and use the results of this analysis to pull in related content. This suggests a possibly new take on remix: "regeneration", "improvisation on a theme" or "replacement of component parts".</p>

<p>The static content may be reused by reference. The static content has a (weak) structure and may contain its own components or references to components in the sense that the static content may or may not support disaggregation.</p>

<p>One of the OU course production models is to 'wrap' a third party book. The book can provide much of the structure of the course, as well as the content. Here,  the book provides static, by reference content, and informs course production/development by suggesting a course structure in two possible ways: 1) at a high level, the course is physically structured around the book e.g. the course is delivered as an annotated reading guide; 2) the internal structure of the book maybe be used to inform the structured presentation order of content/topics within the course.</p>

<p>The delivered content - that is, the content that tends to be made available as open courseware - is more problematic.</p>

<p>Delivered content maybe useful if it is free-text searchable. Delivered content may provide metadata around components contained within it.</p>

<p>Images in slides are often reusable. The slides themselves provide metadata which makes the image discoverable in the context of the subject and so aid reuse by aiding discovery of reusable components.</p>

<p>Any particular slide may be reusable if it tells a good story or makes a particularly good point.</p>

<p>A set of slides is unlikely to be reusable as delivered content: a) a lecture is a performance structured by the performer in a particular way; b) too much is tied up in the delivery, unsaid by the slides.</p>

<p>If the slides are exhaustive/text heavy, they are unlikely to be reusable. They have the feeling of a static resource, that can be referenced, but not easily disaggregated or literally reused.</p>

<p>Static content is not delivered, it is referred to and then consumed.</p>

<p>A set of slides plus and audio track or transcript is likely to be of more benefit to someone who was at the lecture than someone who wasn't.</p>

<p>UPDATE: There are exceptions - 'lectures' like the Royal Institution Christmas lectures and the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22walter+lewin%22+video+site%3Aocw.mit.edu%2FOcwWeb">video lectures on physics given by Walter Lewin</a> are based around physical demonstrations. In Lewin's case, effective camera work means that when stuff is scribbled on the board, you can actually see read it on the video.</p>

<p>Reusing a course at a course level is unlikely to be adopted by third party educators if they are expected to include an element of performance or delivery in the course. If a course is built purely around reference, and does not include an element of delivery by the educator, then the learner at a traditional institution may well take issue with the service being provided.</p>

<p>An independent learner who was not a member of the original intended course may take the course and attempt to reuse it that way, although they are likely to miss out on the delivered and contextual/conversational content.</p>

<p>Academic courses tend to be taught in accordance with the received, accepted canon of the subject area. Course structures may be useful in identifying "that which must be taught".</p>

<p>And finally - to what extent does informal learning around a subject need to follow a canonical academic path in order to benefit the learner?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/learning" rel="tag">learning</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rambling" rel="tag">rambling</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%20blah" rel="tag"> blah</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>In a comment to the post,  John Haccket of <a href="" http:="" www.ll4schools.co.uk="">The Learning Landscape for Schools</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>The Learning Landscape for Schools is a recently launched elgg installation for schools.<br />
...<br />
We are supported by <a href="http://www.e2bn.org">E2BN</a> - one of the RBCs responsible for supplying internet services to schools and Local Authorites in the East of England<br />
...<br />
As the demise of eduspaces has happened so fast LL4S is not really in a position to offer space to all the current account holders - many will probably fall outside the remit of our site. However, if there are now homeless blogging teachers out there that are keen to use elgg with their students we would happy to accept any existing data they have so they can continue their own blogs and bring a safe, global social network into their classroom.<br />
...<br />
LL4S is not a free service as costs must be recuperated, expansion planned for and subscriptions are our only source of income. But I think we are great value!</blockquote>I think my first observation here would be - if EduSpaces had been running under a subscription model, would they be shutting the service down in this way?</p>

<p>That said, this does demonstrate an opportunity for sites that do have resources to pick up subscribers en masse if an open source hosted application venture fails, by quickly setting up a 'disaster recovery', contingency or resilience migration service into an installation of the same open source application.</p>

<p>In his post, Brian writes: "So did those of us who signed up to the service (including myself) fail in our responsibilities to our communities by not expressing concerns over the bluntness of the statement that 'We reserve the right to modify or terminate the EduSpaces service for any reason, without notice at any time'? "</p>

<p>Maybe...</p>

<p>In another comment to the post, Alan Cann writes: "When I was a young man, I thought new year resolutions were naff, but I've made (and mostly kept) one for the past few years now. You just helped me decide what next year's resolution is going to be: work out my strategy for surviving the bubble burst which is surely coming in 2008 and will result in multiple sites/services disappearing."</p>

<p>I can't help thinking that there should be some mileage in tracking the consequences of the EduSpaces announcement, not just from the point of view of users as users and how they cope with the loss of this service, but also from the point of view of "policy" with regard to insitutions recommending (or not) the use of third party services.</p>

<p>As a starting point, I wonder if the following idea, from The Observer Leader on Sunday ("<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2228449,00.html">A very British bubble for Mr Brown</a>") is of any use? The piece opened with the following paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>The buzz words in the world of finance these days are 'moral hazard'. That is economist-speak for what happens when people who have engaged in risky business and fallen foul of market forces are let off the hook. It is the recognition that when you give dodgy lenders and borrowers an inch, they recklessly gamble for another mile</blockquote>Wikipedia (all hail...!;-) defines moral hazard thus: "Moral hazard is the prospect that a party insulated from risk may behave differently than it would if it were fully exposed to the risk. For example, an insured party's behaviour might be more risky than it would have been without the insurance. Moral hazard arises because an individual or institution does not bear the full consequences of its actions, and therefore has a tendency to act less carefully than it otherwise would, leaving another party to bear some responsibility for the consequences of those actions."</p>

<p>In terms of our actual use of services, and the expectations we have about their longevity, maybe informed by announcements from those companies themselves (Brian again: "as the service was relaunched on 8 October 2007 as 'the world's largest social network for education and educational technology' users of the service might be surprised at the sudden demise of the service."), what is our actual or implied 'moral hazard' position as applied to "free" third party web apps?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/policy" rel="tag">policy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ple" rel="tag">ple</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">BBC Web   2.0 - Watch Again Online, Plus a Personalised Homepage</h3>

<p>There were a couple of significant changes to the BBC website this week, (which also saw the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/">BBC archive trial</a>).</p>

<p>First up, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">BBC iPlayer</a> moved online. In its original release, the iPlayer offered a downloadable client and library application (Windows only, for DRM reasons), which could be used to download BBC programmes within 7 days of broadcast, and then allow users to start to watch the content within 30 days of download (having started to watch, the content would be deleted after seven days). As of last week, you can now watch content online, on any platform (except the Wii:-(, via a browser. If you have the latest Flash player installed, this includes on full screen view.</p>

<p>One thing that's nice about the new iPlayer service is that programmes are bookmarkable via a URL. So for example, here is a link to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b0084lg1.shtml">first episode of Fanny Hill</a>, which you may or may not consider to be work safe. FOr adult content such as this, there is a checkbox screen requiring you to state you are over 16, with additional Guidance/lock controls available. For something a little less risque, here's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008kj0y.shtml">Kenneth Brannagh on the Culture Show</a>. Once the seven day watch again period has expired, I'm not sure what happens. Maybe pay to play, in the long run?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2104/2114813491_9f089b8c57.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="315" width="500" /></p>

<p>A couple of other things to notice - the service is out "in beta", and it also offers a range of 'traditional' sharing options, with links to social bookmarking and recommendation sites, as well as a self-contained recommend/email to a friend option. I have one quibble with the "Link to This" URL, though - there's no easy/automagical way of highlighting it and copying it to the clipboard.</p>

<p>A second major beta release was of the new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/beta/">BBC Customisable homepage</a>. Inspired by the like of Netvibes and Google Personal Pages, the new BBC homepage lets you customise the BBC homepage to a limited extent, such as deciding what news feeds you'd like to appear (and where - there is a certain amount of drag and droppable goodness), local weather, BBC TV listings and so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2114836423_97e7dbb6d6.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="344" width="500" /></p>

<p>The third announcement that caught my eye - made possible by the iPlayer online release - was the inclusion of watch/listen again services in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">BBC Programmes</a> website.</p>

<p>Here's how it looks...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2182/2114850309_894861486c.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="287" width="500" /></p>

<p>...and then click though...</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2176/2114850593_aea2903cfb.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="422" width="500" /></p>

<p>Audio player/Listen again links are also provide for Radio programmes, although links to archived radio programmes (that go back years in some cases) don't seem to have appeared on the Programmes site yet...</p>

<p>It's probably worth making a quick comment here about BBC URL goodness. For example:<br />
<ul><li>BBC iPlayer page for Spooks series 6 episode 9: <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008flpc.shtm</em></li><li>BBC Programmes page for Spooks series 6 episode 9: <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008flpc</em></li></ul>Notice anything similar? (Boo!;-)</p>

<p>Making content like available in this way is a Good Thing, I think, though the requirement for a recent Flash Player means the iPlayer won't work (at least in full screen mode) on the Wii... :-( Not having such toys, I wonder how the iPod touch will cope? Given that access to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7045123.stm">BBC content can be had for free via The Cloud wifi network</a> (stations, airports, pubs and hotels across the UK and abroad...), I can maybe start to see possible uptake of anytime, anywhere TV ;-)</p>

<p>And finally, what of the dear old BBC/OU relationship? The OU enters into co-production deals with the BBC on quite a few high profile broadcast series (<a href="http://open2.net/nhs/oneyearon/index.html">Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS?</a>, for example), so will we be seeing the iPlayer embedded - with watch again content - on appropriate pages on the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> website (which is <a href="http://www.bbcwil.com/av_open2.htm">produced by the commercial <em>BBC Worldwide Interactive Learning</em> unit for the OU</a>).</p>

<p>If YouTube is anything to go by, maybe not... The BBC have put up content from several OU/BBC co-pro series onto YouTube (such as clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaPJw2O6cUg">James May's 20th Century</a>), but these are unembeddable and - as far as I know - haven't appeared on the <a href="http://www.open2.net/20thcentury/index.html">corresponding open2.net page</a>.</p>

<p>In an age where the big dot com announcements appear in association with third party partners (Google launching Open Social with several partners, for example), I continue to be amazed that the OU/BBC partnership doesn't appear to extend as far as increasing the surface of content on the web via sites that are built around particular series by production partners... ho hum....</p>

<p>As it's the weekend, I've been having an bit of an extended play with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google charts API</a> and some data from the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Course Profiles Facebook app</a>. The app now has just over 2,500 users, so while the data is still sparse there is almost enough to start putting together some proof of concept reports.</p>

<p>Having been introduced to the Python language by the O'Reilly <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21"><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em></a> book, examples from which I've already had a bit of a tinker with (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012128.html">Hierarchical Course Clusters from Course Profiles App</a>, for example), it seemed sensible to carry on it that language putting together the reports. A quick scout around turned up a <a href="http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/">Python wrapper for the Google Charts API</a>, which makes creating chart URLs pretty straightforward (here's a more general list of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chart-api/web/useful-links-to-api-libraries">programming language wrappers for the Google Chart API</a>).</p>

<p>The first function I wrote generates a URL for a pie chart showing the distribution of users on a particular course according to the specified course status. The caveat heere is that users who don;t engage withthe course profiles app much will have all their courses flagged as 'current' by default.</p>

<p><a href="http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/"></a><img alt="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x160&amp;chd=s:6oL&amp;chtt=T175%20on%20Course%20Profiles%20%28109%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=Completed|Current|Future" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x160&amp;chd=s:6oL&amp;chtt=T175%20on%20Course%20Profiles%20%28109%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=Completed%7CCurrent%7CFuture" /></p>

<p><br />
The next function I put together was one that takes in a course code, <em>two</em> status identifiers, and a threshold value, and then produces charts like this one:</p>

<p><img alt="The image “http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:DHNEDFD&amp;chtt=Completed%20T175%20users%20stating%2038%20Current%20courses%20%28min%203%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=BM240|M150|M255|M257|M263|MU120|M366” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:DHNEDFD&amp;chtt=Completed%20T175%20users%20stating%2038%20Current%20courses%20%28min%203%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=BM240%7CM150%7CM255%7CM257%7CM263%7CMU120%7CM366" /></p>

<p>The description of this chart is as follows: "for students who have said they have <em>completed</em> <em>T175</em>, the chart displays those courses they have said they are <em>Currently</em> taking (subject to at least <em>3</em> people having said they are currently taking each course shown).</p>

<p>This type of report reveals (within the context of the Course Profiles app) the relationship between a stated course (declared as "completed", "current" or "future") and other courses declared with a particular status ("completed", "current" or "future") by the same user. For each course code, there are thus nine possible status combination reports, each subject to a particular reporting threshold.</p>

<p>Here are a few more examples...</p>

<p>A report for DSE212 that shows, for students who have said they are currently taking DSE212, what courses they have said they intend to take in the future (subject to at least 4 people having said they intend to take the course in the future):</p>

<p><img alt="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:QPPOHEJE&amp;chtt=Current%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2084%20Future%20courses%20%28min%204%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=ED209|DD303|DD307|SD226|DZX222|D315|DXR222|DSE232" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:QPPOHEJE&amp;chtt=Current%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2084%20Future%20courses%20%28min%204%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=ED209%7CDD303%7CDD307%7CSD226%7CDZX222%7CD315%7CDXR222%7CDSE232" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>A report that shows, for students who have said they are currently taking DSE212, what courses they have said they have already completed (subject to at least 4 people having said they've completed the course):</p>

<p><img alt="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:lGEGFE&amp;chtt=Current%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2062%20Completed%20courses%20%28min%204%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=DD100|DD121|S193|S103|MU120|SK185" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:lGEGFE&amp;chtt=Current%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2062%20Completed%20courses%20%28min%204%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=DD100%7CDD121%7CS193%7CS103%7CMU120%7CSK185" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
A report that shows, for students who have said they are intend to take DSE212 in the future, what courses they have said they are currently taking:</p>

<p><img alt="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:DBBBBBBB&amp;chtt=Future%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2010%20Current%20courses%20%28min%201%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=DD100|ED209|U212|Y158|Y157|S180|DD122|Y156" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=450x160&amp;chd=s:DBBBBBBB&amp;chtt=Future%20DSE212%20users%20stating%2010%20Current%20courses%20%28min%201%20users%29&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,10&amp;chl=DD100%7CED209%7CU212%7CY158%7CY157%7CS180%7CDD122%7CY156" /></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the user numbers of the application are still relatively small, which means the above reports are interesting only insofar as they suggest what sorts of reports the data aggregated by the app are possible.</p>

<p>Of course, the OU as an institution has access to comprehensive, authoritative data which can be mined in the above ways... I'm just not sure that: a) I have access to that data, or: b) I am allowed to write arbitrary queries on it...<br />

<!--
<p>If an email comes with an attachment, then I suspect that in a large number of cases the sender is probably using the wrong medium. So for example, this morning I found in my mailbox:<br />
<blockquote>Three seminar announcements with *ALL* the details in an attached word file (nothing in the body of the message). ("Please find enclosed details of our next seminar" - you know the sort of thing...)</p>

<p>Two newsletters as PDF attachments (they're available on the web as well...)</p>

<p>And a flurry of emails representing forwarded messages from other applications (my own fault...)<br />
</blockquote><br />
So I think I may try a new mail rule: <br />
<ul><li>if attachment then</li><ul><li>silently delete AND<br />
</li><li>reply-to-sender "Please find another way of letting me see the document you sent as an enclosure - I do have a browser, you know... If the document is for commenting on by several people, try Google docs, Zoho, or Microsoft Live whatever it's called..."</li></ul></ul>Now I know my own email practice is lousy, but I am trying to work on it...</p>

<p>So for example, I quite often mail people links, which can probably be annoying at times...</p>

<p>...so I'm working hard on getting people to set up a delicious account, subscribe to the "<a href="http://del.icio.us/help/for">links for you</a>" feed, and then I can share links with them using the delicious <em>for:</em> tag.</p>

<p>That said, I'm starting to find I now need a level of indirection, in that I can't remember people's delicious names and I need to find a way of getting nicknames to work... so if you know of a flock extension that lets me create an address book for for: tagging people using the flock bookmark tool, please let me know :-)</p>

<p>(For more on delicious, this is interesting: Jon Udell "<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/12/12/discovering-versus-teaching-principles-of-social-information-management/">Discovering versus teaching principles of social information management</a>"</p>

<p>If you don't know what <a href="http://delicious.com">delicious</a> is, check out the Common Craft "<a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/bookmarking-plain-english">Social Bookmarking in Plain English</a>" video:</p>

<p>One important thing to note from the point of view of this post is if we both have delcious accounts, we can send bookmarks to each other...</p>

<p>PS lazyweb, oh, lazyweb, is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008527.html">read/writemail</a> ready yet?</p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/classroom.html">Lesson plans</a> and student activity sheets for primary (cross-curricular) and secondary (geography, history and citizenship)</li><li>A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/googleukschools">discussion group</a> to share ideas on how to use Google in the classroom with other teachers</li><li>A comprehensive <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/howto.html">guide</a> on how to use Google Earth, including when carrying out fieldwork </li><li>Links to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/howto.html">information</a> on how to use Google tools</li><li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/howto.html">Tutorials</a> for students on how to search well</li><li>Useful "<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/gadgets.html">gadgets</a>" for teachers that you can add to your Google homepage such as the latest news on education and schools</li><li>Links to other Google <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/schools/otherprojects.html">projects</a> for schools </li></ul></blockquote>With barriers to accessing information coming down, threatening one element of the academic value proposition, and opportunities for developing personal knowledge networks and accessing subject matter expertise increasing all the time (as Stuart picked up on today in <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/?p=95">Constructing Your Own Knowledge Network</a>), I wonder what would happen if a disruption to the notion of what makes a socially acceptable "qualification" opened up the education market to current online businesses; and furthermore, how might those businesses wear an educational hat?</p>

<p>That is, suppose that "that bit of paper", the degree certificate or other formal qualification, no longer guarantees the foot in the door to a new job because there's a new reputation/competency model in town (I don't know what that might be, but in a market where 50% of the population have a first degree, for example, a degree is maybe not such a differentiator any more...).</p>

<p>And suppose that today's properly commercial dot com corporates (not just <a href="http://openuniversity.co.uk">http://openuniversity.co.uk</a> or<a href="http://www.openuniversity.com/"> http://www.openuniversity.com/</a>) could move in to provide the services that supported the "teaching and learning" bits of the new reputation/competency model - what would they offer?<br />
<ul><li><em>ebay.edu</em> - a marketplace for instruction and tutelage, as well as a clearing house for courses and educational materials. What would determine the value (and price) of a "real qualification" compared to an offprint degree certificate from Lower Dogswallop Univercity (<em>sic</em>), I wonder?<br />
</li><li><em>google.edu</em> - lesson plans, discussion groups, lots and lots of information, online office tools, bibliographic research tools and so on (err.....?;-)</li><li><em>itunes.edu</em> - <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunesu/">err...?</a></li><li><em>amazon.edu</em> - I wonder how many educators are putting their reading lists into an Amazon listmania list, and creating an academic <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/">aStore</a> off the back of it, like the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/009233.html">OpenLearn_daily store</a>? And why buy articles (if you have to pay from them) from one of those hard to use services your library subscribes to when you can <a href="http://www.thes.co.uk/current_edition/story.aspx?story_id=2034035">buy academic research articles from Amazon</a>? (They are sold as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/e-Docs-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=551440">e-Docs</a>.)</li><li><em>facebook.edu</em> (or <em>linkedin.edu</em>) - duh...</li><li><em>bbc.edu</em> - public service broadcasting in support of a lifelong learning agenda... (did you see that BBC watch again programmes can now be <a href="http://james.cridland.net/blog/2007/12/12/iplayer-on-gnulinux/">streamed to the browser on any platform via the new iPlayer streaming service</a>? For example: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008fn0z.shtml">Have I Got News for You?)</a></li><li><em>yahoo.edu</em> - <a href="http://teachers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo teachers</a>, whatever... (I can't believe people are calling it a platform for teachers, rather than a platform for sharing learning and teaching expertise, experience, knowledge and resources... In a future where we learn from each other as well as from content, we'll all be teachers and learners, won't we?)</li></ul>Maybe we should be thankful that the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/truth-about-edu-domains-registration-links-and-google-juice/6095/">dot edu top-level domain is so carefully controlled</a>...   <!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/disruptiveinnovation" rel="tag">disruptiveinnovation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/education" rel="tag">education</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>Following the announcement earlier this week of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012199.html">MIT open courseware material for High Schools</a>, Yale have released a set of lectures on their open content site: <a href="http://open.yale.edu/courses/index.html">Open Yale Courses</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, as you might expect, they don't offer RSS so I've started to look at what I might be able to pull out.</p>

<p>Here's a first approximation to a feed from Yale, via a Grazr widget: <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=NCrFJbGp3BGnGTXQ6kjTQA&amp;_render=rss">Open Yale: Fundamentals of Physics</a> (here's the <a href="http://open.yale.edu/courses/physics/fundamentals-of-physics/home.html">original course splash page</a>):</p>

<div style="height: 400px; width: 300px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=NCrFJbGp3BGnGTXQ6kjTQA&amp;_render=rss" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;theme=gloss_silver&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=NCrFJbGp3BGnGTXQ6kjTQA&amp;_render=rss"></script></div>

<p>I use a "Fetch Page" Yahoo pipe block to grab the list of individual lecture pages from <a href="http://open.yale.edu/courses/physics/fundamentals-of-physics/sessions.html">here</a> and then rewrite the URLs to point to the transcript of the lecture, adding a link to the MP3 audio file as an enclosure (so it'll play in the Grazr widget). I'll see if I can geta version working that plays the video in the widget too...</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2109507460_b1c6d75cc4_o.png" /></p>

<p>If you think it's clever and/or obviously very hard to do, it's not, it's about using your eyes to look at patterns across URLs, copying examples of other Yahoo pipes, and hacking the regular expressions around blindly till they appear to work.</p>

<p>I did try to get the pipe to force a page load of the relevant transcript into the corresponding description of each feed item, but for some reason it didn't work :-) Ho hum - will see if i can figure out why (maybe there are too many page load hits for the pipe to want to do it?!)</p>

<p>I used a similar page loading trick to get a feed of <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=CHLP3L2m3BGyirakyp1_DQ">MIT Courseware for High Schools Course Topic Listings</a>, a demo of how to get an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=7BW5hBen3BGrNS6NJhOy0Q">MIT OCW for High Schools Courses by topic listing</a> and an example <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=Flgv0bum3BGazKtIE5PZnA">itemised feed deconstruction of a particular course</a>.</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:500px;"><a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=o&file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Flgv0bum3BGazKtIE5PZnA&_render=rss&courseURL=http%3A%2F%2Focw.mit.edu%2FOcwWeb%2Fhs%2Fphysics%2Fb%2F1%2F1.htm" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0"></a><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?view=o&amp;file=http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Flgv0bum3BGazKtIE5PZnA&amp;_render=rss&amp;courseURL=http%3A%2F%2Focw.mit.edu%2FOcwWeb%2Fhs%2Fphysics%2Fb%2F1%2F1.htm"></script></div>

<p>I think it'd be easy enough to hack a line or two of PHP to OPMLify a couple of the feeds and rewrite a URL or two so I could pipe the whole of the MIT open courseware for High Schools into a single Grazr widget, but to tell the truth I can't be bothered...</p>

<p>There's probably more than a few well funded and well resourced projects out there prattling around talking about how they might be able to do this sort of thing or that sort of thing or another sort of thing if only they could sort out what acronym to give the project, so I don't see why I should bother with yet another micro-effort demo of something fun to do, actually realised, but probably completely pointless.<br />

<p>A couple of 'institutional' people have picked up on the Venturebeat reported story that a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/12/03/facebook-education-app-gets-funding">Facebook education app gets funding</a> inside the OU and posts have also appeared about it <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/johndale/entry/facebook_and_courses/">elsewhere</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Inigral, a company behind a Facebook application called Courses, has raised slightly more than half a million in a round led by The Founders Fund, according to VentureWire.</p>

<p>Courses lets you find others in your college classes, then share notes with them, start a forum discussion, do a video chat and more. You can also keep track of assignments, upload your own notes and manage your course activities.</blockquote><br />
You can see reports on some of these <a href="http://adonomics.com/display/2365273563+4472914735+2863988150">education apps on Facebook via Adonomics</a> (thanks to <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/SocialCommunications/">Stuart</a> for the original screenshot):</p>

<p><img style="width: 711px; height: 234px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2104663754_948d2fa391_o.png" /></p>

<p>The app mentioned in the Venturebeat story is <em>Courses</em>.</p>

<p>I posted a couple of chaser comments about the story, which I'll summarise them here 'for my own record':<br />
<blockquote>The avenue we're keen to explore [with Course Profiles] is the extent to which 'public' social networks can be used to provide additional forms of support for our home study students, who are spread across the UK (and indeed, across the world). [In this sense, Course Profiles is (currently) an instituion specific application.]</p>

<p>So as with the other apps, we support 'find a study buddy' functionality, 'friends on a course' and course comment walls.</p>

<p>We're also offering support in the app for people taking <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn open educational courses</a> so you can add an OpenLearn course unit to your profile if you want to. Again, the idea here is to help broker social networks amongst learners where physical colocation is all but ruled out, unlike the situation in trad universities where you sit in lectures with your peers.</p>

<p>One of the the things we are looking at with our app are ways of making it a little bit stickier. Just listing courses is something that will take you to the app once per course. Building some sort of weekly (or even daily) use case around the app is a whole other issue.</p>

<p>One thing we are wary of doing with the app is <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011606.html%20">intruding on the student's social space</a>; so finding useful things for users to do in the app without making it seem like we are forcing VLE functionality into Facebook is one of the thing's we're thinking around...</p>

<p>At the moment, our daily users are running at about 5% on a userbase of 2,400. With approx 50 adds a day accounting for 2% of daily users, that means we have 2-3% daily active users. I don't know that really means though.</p>

<p>[So how much activity should we expect in the app, if we want to claim it is 'successful'?]</p>

<p>- Adding a course to the profile is something you do once.<br />
- Looking for a study buddy on a course maybe something you do a handful of times.<br />
- Commenting on a course maybe something you do regularly IF the comment wall takes on the role of an active FB group for a course, or if it takes over part of the role of the 'official' course (or alumni) conference.<br />
- Using the 'friends on a course' area as a place for communicating with friends (like a cut down address book) is something you might do regularly (err???? ;-)</p>

<p>The way we're thinking about the app in its current form, it's hard to see why daily use rates would be that high at all?</p>

<p>And bear in mind that if you max out on average at one or two weekly visits for the duration of the course, this would only give 1/7 = 14% daily active users...</p>

<p>So maybe 3% active for course profiles isn't that bad?</blockquote>Although Course Profiles was started as an unofficial, skunkworks app, and largely continues as such, the app has been mentioned in several official channels, with a news item on students' "Student Home" webpage, a mention on the Open University profile page on Facebook, and plugs in both Open House, the internal staff magazine, and Sesame, the student and alumni magazine (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/events/5/2007124_59055_o1.pdf">download avalailable</a>: "Show us your face!" p32).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/2105443610_8f3615e3f7_o.png" /></p>

<p>Finally, I picked up on another UK HEI use of Facebook from a sideways mention by IT Professional of the Year, <a href="http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/oclc-symposium-at-online-information-2007/">BriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIAN KELLY</a>): in particular, the "pilot [use of a] Facebook group for students on our [Oxford] short online courses" (Dave White, "<a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2007/11/28/reaching-into-the-web/">Reaching into the Web</a>").</p>

<p>There's quite a bit of <a href="http://isthmus.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/PersistentCommunityDiscuss">relevant discussion behind the decision to use a Facebook group</a> on their project wiki.</p>

<p>We've started discussing potential "issues" we might get into if we start recommending that students use Facebook groups, or the Course Profiles app course comments walls, in any sort of "official" way (direct, implied or otherwise), so it'll be interesting to see whether the Oxford discussions have mirrored our own...<br />

<p>Just over a year ago, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk">KMi</a> released the lightweight <a href="http://msg.open.ac.uk">MSG Instant messenger app</a>, which I saw demoed in the context of a quick <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007760.html"><em>ad hoc</em> conference chat</a> solution.</p>

<p>Since then, <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/developer/msg-map-widget/">Google presence maps</a>, and an <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/user-guide/msg-netvibes-widget/">MSG Netvibes widget</a> have appeared, and a link to the similarly lite <a href="http://www.mebeam.com/">Mebeam 1-click video chatroom</a> app added to the interface (<a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/2007/11/21/video-chat/">MSG Video Chat</a>).</p>

<p>And now, following the opening of an open OpenID  on the open.ac.uk domain (!) last week, Alex has just posted that <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/?p=288">MSG now accepts OpenID identities</a>, along with the claim that "MSG is the first instant messenger system to offer open registration and the ability to login with an OpenID identity".</p>

<p><img src="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/alex/images/msg-openid.jpg" alt="MSG login page" /></p>

<p>If you want a no frills OpenID, you can grab one at <a href="http://openid.open.ac.uk/">http://openid.open.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't know what OpenID is all about, this may help - <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Vq0R1Y1A2rE">OpenID Show</a></p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vq0R1Y1A2rE&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vq0R1Y1A2rE&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>If you want an MSG account (instant registration), you can get one at <a href="http://http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/launch/">http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/launch/</a></p>

<p>A good way to get an MSG account is to just log in straight away with an OpenID, and then an MSG account will be invisibly created for you.</p>

<p>And the next step...? Hmmm... it'd be really neat if <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> was to start accepting OpenIDs... ;-)</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/developer/">MSG is open source</a></p>

<!--
<p>Some time ago, Amazon's <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/">Jeff Barr</a> gave one of his Amazon Web Services Evangelism talks at the OU (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007294.html">Jeff Barr - Amazon Web Service Evangelist, KMi Podium</a>).</p>

<p>At the time, I asked whether Amazon was looking to take on Paypal with a payments web service/1-click payment mechanism, to which the reply was non-committal in a 'not as far as I am aware' sort of way...</p>

<p>I didn't record when the beta was launched (though I do have a bookmark for it dated 24/10/07), but Amazon have been offering limited access to their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342430011">Flexible Payments Web Service</a> for some time now:<br />
<blockquote>Amazon Flexible Payments Service (Amazon FPS) is the first payments service designed from the ground up specifically for developers. The set of web services APIs allows the movement of money between any two entities, humans or computers. It is built on top of Amazon's reliable and scalable payment infrastructure.</p>

<p>Amazon FPS offers developers unmatched flexibility in how they can structure payment instructions, including standing instructions that can remain in place for multiple transactions.  These instructions impose conditions and constraints on money movements and can be set by both senders and receivers of funds. For example, a sender might set a spending limit per week for a particular named recipient. Only that named recipient would be able to withdraw funds and only up to an amount per week equal to the spending limit.</blockquote>Today, the 1-click part moves a step nearer with the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/12/introducing-the.html">Amazon 'Pay Now' widget</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="Paynow_staticbutton" title="Paynow_staticbutton" src="http://aws.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/10/paynow_staticbutton.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border="0" /><img alt="Paynow_dynamicbutton" title="Paynow_dynamicbutton" src="http://aws.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/10/paynow_dynamicbutton.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border="0" /></p>

<blockquote>The new "Pay Now" widget builds on top of the base-level payment functionality offered by the Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) to make things very easy for web developers who would like to accept Amazon Payments on their site. Customers can pay by clicking on a Pay Now button or by selecting Amazon Payments as their payment method.</blockquote>

<p>For more details, check out the <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/about?nodeId=30017">Amazon "Pay Now" widget FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Also related, the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_pdnHome.html">PayPal Developer Centre</a>, which describes the wide range of Paypal web services that are currently available, including the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_expresscheckout.html">PayPal Express Checkout service</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">My CRIG Wishlist Item #1: Consistent, Transformable, Well Structured URLs</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the 'posters' I contributed toat the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012181.html">CRIG unconference</a> (on the topic of "cool URLs", I think?)  had a doodle on it that looked a little bit like this:</p>

<p><img alt="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1335564/L.jpg" src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1335564/M.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's not necessarily that clear as to what this image is supposed to mean, but it unpacks quite a long way, so here's a little bit of clarification.</p>

<p>Take a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PE-I2L_GvrU">typical Youtube video page</a> as an<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25451952@N00/2101253913/" title="youtubePage.png"> </a>example:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2101253913_cbb6aa1c83.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="320" width="500" /></p>

<p>In this case, the URL of the splash page that provides the user interface to the actual (embedded) video resource can be used to derive the URL of the video resource, which can in turn to be used to configure the embed code:</p>

<p>Page URL: <em>http://youtube.com/watch?v=PE-I2L_GvrU</em></p>

<p>Video asset URL: <em>http://www.youtube.com/v/PE-I2L_GvrU</em></p>

<p>Embed code: <em>&lt;object width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PE-I2L_GvrU&amp;rel=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PE-I2L_GvrU&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</em></p>

<p>The important thing to note is that if I know the Youtube URL patterns (<em>http://youtube.com/watch?v=<strong>ID</strong></em> and <em>http://www.youtube.com/v/<strong>ID</strong></em>, for example) and the resource ID (<em>PE-I2L_GvrU</em> in the above example) I can create the URL for the splash page and the actual media asset, and configure some embed code so that I can embed the movie in a page of my choosing.</p>

<p>Now compare what's on offer with the <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk">OU Open Research Repository</a> site<br />
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2072/2102049110_6a18ea2079.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="244" width="500" /></p>

<p>The publication list by area provides URLs to the splash page for each resource, as well as a link to a downloadable copy of the resource if it is available.</p>

<p>The splash page itself repeats the reference (in one particular citation style - maybe a more flexible <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007225.html">Cite this Page</a> utility would be appropriate, here?) and again provides a link to the downloadable copy of the resource (where available). A copy of the abstract is also provided.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/2101268125_14492b9f7a.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="275" width="500" /></p>

<p>However, whilst the path to the PDF resource can be obtained from the splash page URL, the actual filename used to identify the resource is arbitrary (and appears to be the name of the file that was originally uploaded to the repository)...</p>

<p>...which means that to get a link to the resource from the resource splash page, you need to scrape the page for the link (if it exists).</p>

<p>The one saving grace is that my <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> browser extension manages to pick up the reference from the ORO page:-)</p>

<p>Now compare the functionality of the ORO splash page with one from <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/351701/">Scribd</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2368/2102049336_c5e83f9a16.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="284" width="500" /></p>

<p>Here, an emdedded (and embeddable) preview of the whole document is provided, along with downloads in a variety of formats and the ability to bookmark and favourite the resource, as well as share it with others. Needless to say, the URLs of the downloadable document versions are all simple transfromations of the splash page URL. (that is, given any one of the URLs, I can generate the others, assuming I know the appropriate URL patterns).</p>

<p>But then, I keep forgetting: repositories are place where you archive dead documents, aren't they?! So making it easy for people to consume the content isn't part of the collection policy ;-)</p>

<p>Finally, returning to the ORO collection, the <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/help/">inclusion policy for the collection</a> is less than welcoming for the submission of informal publications at least:<br />
<blockquote>Open Research Online is an Open Access repository of The Open University's peer reviewed, published research. It is being populated with records of published research from the year 2001 to the present. The service is publicly accessible and can be browsed and searched freely. While most records are research publications, the repository allows a range of research output types to be recorded. A publication or other research output is only deemed to be eligible for inclusion in Open Research Online if it has arisen from research undertaken as part of an individual's contracted and approved role within the OU.</blockquote>That said, I wonder whether declaring that "the repository allows a range of research output types to be recorded" leaves the door open for the submission of presentations to formal events?</p>

<p>If not, then there's always <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a>, which is where I post my presentations.</p>

<p>PS <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2007/11/urls.shtml">BBC cool URLs</a></p>

<p>PPS <a href="http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/print.php?p=84">Interoperability for the Discovery, Use, and Re-Use of Units of Scholarly Communication</a> (via Downes): "This paper describes the work of the Object Re-Use and Exchange (ORE) project of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) to develop ... standards to facilitate discovery, use and re-use of new types of compound scholarly communication units by networked services and applications. Compound units are aggregations of distinct information units that, when combined, form a logical whole. Some examples of these are a digitized book that is an aggregation of chapters, where each chapter is an aggregation of scanned pages, and a scholarly publication that is an aggregation of text and supporting materials such as datasets, software tools, and video recordings of an experiment. The ORE work aims to develop mechanisms for representing and referencing compound information units in a machine-readable manner that is independent of both the actual content of the information unit and nature of the re-using application."</p>

<p>PS Related: <a href="http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2008/01/complexity-comp.html">Complexity, compschlexity</a>: "For some time now I've argued that the Web is made up of complex objects anyway (in the sense that almost every Web page you look at is a bundle of text, images and other stuff) but that the Web does well to treat these as loosely-coupled bundles of individual items - items that are to a large extent managed and delivered separately." continues...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/CRIG" rel="tag">CRIG</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/JISC" rel="tag">JISC</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/cool%20URLs" rel="tag">cool URLs</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<p>It seems that MIT have started to <a href="http://www.campustechnology.com/articles/56334">reach out to High Schools with the MIT open courseware</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, "there are thousands of resources designed just for high school teachers and students, including 15,000 lecture notes".</p>

<p>Good stuff - I can't wait to try it out, and see if I can remix some of it with Openlearn content...</p>

<p>I particularly ike this set of lecture notes on Newton's First Law (<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/hs/physics/physics/8-01Fall-2003_l08001_6.pdf">pdf download</a>):</p>

<p>Ever since i came across the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007032.html">Popup project</a>, (which in turn became <a href="http://fotowoosh.com">Fotowoosh</a>), a technology for 'flying around' inside a photograph, I've been waiting for the software to be released... and it seems that now it is available...</p>

<p>...as a Facebook app: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotowoosh/">Fotowoosh in Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://facebook.fotowoosh.com/public/view/2175884570216859230">an example fotowoosh view</a> "I've" just created:</p>

<p><object height="225" width="300"><param name="movie" value="http://wooshes.fotowoosh.com/wooshes/05/6/2/50661/2175884570216859230.swf"><param name="autostart" value="false"><embed src="http://wooshes.fotowoosh.com/wooshes/05/6/2/50661/2175884570216859230.swf" loop="false" autostart="false" height="300" width="400"></object><br />
<a href="#" style="color: black;" onclick="javascript:history.go();">Play embedded version again</a></p>

<p>Now, I'm not a photographer, and I didn't have any photos easily to hand on this computer, so I paid a quick visit to flickr looking for a Creative Commons licensed photo I could remix, and came up with that one - this one - of the local village: "Nice Street in Brading" by Hembo Pagi (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hembo/375478709/">see it on flickr</a>):</p>

<p><img style="width: 211px; height: 211px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/375478709_1ae3b2915e.jpg?v=0" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" /></p>

<p>A quick upload to my Facebook account (using the <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> People sidebar and photo uploader, of course...), select it in the fotowoosh Facebook app, 5 mins of backend processing on their server and fotowoosh..................</p>

<p>Desktop computer and games console slideshows (together with the Ken Burns effect) have a lot to answer for in terms of surfacing old photos on a day-to-day basis... I can see this technique quickly being added to the photo slideshow presentation palette and bringing those old digital photos alive even more...</p>

<p>PS the way the service appears to have been released was interesting, I thought... I got an email from the fotowoosh 'keep me updated' mailing list saying the fotowoosh Facebook app was now available. I've been watching the blogosphere - and the fotowoosh website - on and off for news of the public launch for ages, so for that launch to be revealed by email and delivered in Facebook is, err, a sign of something...?</p>

<p>PPS It's maybe worth noting that you can now <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/12/05/edit-your-photos-on-flickr/">edit your photos on flickr using Picnik</a>...</p>

<p>PPPS for more visions of the future of photography, as realised today, check out my <a href="http://web.splashcast.net/full_screen/?channel_code=GIPJ3220JF">Future of Photography</a> Splashcast channel... This post on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010811.html">Future of Estate Agents</a> probably also needs updating with the fotowoosh news...<br />

<!--
<p>For a week or two, now, I've been looking for some simple charting libraries (<a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">Plotkit</a> looked interesting, I thought, as does this <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ajaxian/~3/195518662/plotting-in-jquery">jquery chart plotter extension</a>? and PS the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/">new YUI chart control</a>...) that I can use to plot some basic graph types reporting on the current state of the Course Profiles Facebook app.</p>

<p>For convenience, we're importing some of the data via an XML file into a Google spreadsheet (read how here: <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-spreadsheets-lets-you-import.html">Google Spreadsheeets Lets You Import Online Data</a>). This allows us to plot some simple charts in the spreadsheet itself, as well getting ready access to the data as a gdata feed, JSON output and so on.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a hrefr="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/12/embed-charts-in-webpages-with-one-of.html">Google released a chart API</a> for creating charts and graphs via a URL, so I thought I'd have a bit of a tinker this afternoon, reusing code from a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample.html">Google spreadsheets API example</a> and bit of freeplay with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts API</a>. This is a new offering from Google, that offers a range of chart types, in particular: pie charts, Venn diagrams, line graphs, scatter plots, and bar charts.</p>

<p>Here is an example result:</p>

<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chtt=Top+10+Most+Popular+Course+Profile+Courses&amp;chts=0000ff,20&amp;chd=s:31olidZWVU&amp;chbh=40&amp;chco=0000ff&amp;chs=500x250&amp;chxt=y&amp;chxr=0,0,300&amp;chl=DD100%7CA103%7CS103%7CDSE212%7CM150%7CMST121%7CED209%7CT171%7CMU120%7CSXR103%7C" style="margin: 0pt auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" title="" alt="" /></p>

<p>All the data is passed via a URL, and a png image returned. Many of the chart attributes are customisable, such as colour themes, titles, axis labels and scaling , and so on.</p>

<p>So for example, the above image has an &lt;img src=""/&gt; attribute set to:</p>

<p>http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?<br />
&nbsp;cht=bvs&amp;chtt=Top+10+Most+Popular+Course+Profile+Courses<br />

<!--
<p>Although I've been aware of unconferences for some time, I got to attend my first one over the last couple of days courtesy of an invite from <a href="http://dfflanders.wordpress.com/">David Flanders</a> of the  <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/CRIG">JISC Common Repository Interfaces Working Group</a>. Whilst I'm not involved with any repository projects in the OU - and wouldn't necessarily have thought of myself as a member of the repositories community! - it was surprising how many people I actually recognised there (as well as getting to meet a couple of people whose blogs I follow :-)</p>

<p>Unlike traditional conferences, where attendees get to stand on soapboxes and deliver by death by PowerPoint, the <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/CRIG_Unconference">CRIG Unconference</a> was based around several half-hour unsessions, each of which was split into three discussion areas, focussed around flip charts spaced 5 or metres apart. <em>The Law of Two Feet</em> was adopted as a house rule: "Any person neither learning from nor contributing to a group discussion must walk (or move) to another one (aka 'law of mobility')." In addition, everyone was supplied with a pen and everyone had an equal right to write on the chart.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HLpjrHzgSRM&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>Additional flip charts around the room meant that breakaway groups from the main discussion themes in each unsession were 'allowed' to form, though that didn't seem to happen much(?) - I think the placement of the flipcharts is probably an important factor: having to walk to the other side of the room to reach a breakout chart was a big step to take, and not at all the same as walking a short ditance from one group clustered around a chart to another. (I wonder whether putting 10 or so flip charts in a circle a meter or two apart would have eased the formation of splinter groups (though whether that ould have been desirable is another matter!)?</p>

<p>One thing I hadn't picked up on was that the outcome of each theme in each unsession activity was intended to be a scenario or a challenge (I think that's right?) - I guess that was covered in the initial briefing during the first half day of the event, which I had to miss unfortunately.</p>

<p>(The unconference started for me at its private party, in an upstairs room at a nearby hostelry. As well as beer and food laid on, flipchart paper and pens were evindence there too... Taking the line that most of the real innovative dicsussion gets done in a traditional conference in the bar, the unconference made the evening social a continuation of the day's activities, albeit in a more informal setting and without prior guidane on discussion themes. And being geeks together, we like talking techie stuff <em>all</em> the time, right?)</p>

<p>The unconference 'officially' finished with a 'minute madness' (?) one minute review of each chart by a member of the group who had a part in creating it, and round of <a href="http://www.dotmocracy.org/">dotmocracy</a>, something I am familiar with (we use it a lot in OU meetings, although in a less elaborate form). The idea? We each had 9 sticky dots - three 'green for go', three yellow "take care', and three red 'no way' ones, which we had to place on points or ideas on the charts placed around the room. The scenarios and challenges highlighted by the group decision making process will - I assume - be used to inform the future activities of the CRIG. To make follow up easier, each of us initialled the group charts we'd each had a hand in contributing to.</p>

<p>(Just by the by, an interesting observation made by David, as compere, was that after a quick review of the ideas from the Friday sessions, most of the issues had arisen and been flagged during the evening social session the night before.)</p>

<p>Day's end, and the unconference unended in the bar, where conversations continued and new threads began, including one around the neat sounding <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">Myth TV personal PVR</a> project...;-)</p>

<p>PS if anyone from the unconference is happening by this blog for the first time, the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010097.html">OpenLearn XML Asset Stripper</a> will maybe be of interest to you... I'll be updating it and posting about it in a bit more detail in the next week or two...</p>

<h3 class="title">Reliable Voting...or not...</h3>

<!--
<p>The Edublog Awards seem to have <a href="http://edublogawards.com/now-lets-be-fair/">had</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/love-your-teacher-a-bit-too-much/">a</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/institutional-voting-now-not-possible/">few</a> <a href="http://edublogawards.com/now-to-make-things-a-little-more-exciting/">difficulties</a> with their polls, suggesting that PollDaddy is maybe not up to supporting any polls other than throw away ones, or ones where no-one has a stake in the result?</p>

<p>I've not really looked at polls before - or the various ways (if any) of configuring PollDaddy polls - and comments bantering and brainstorming around the topic don't seem to be welcome on one particular website I can think of ;-), but a couple of things struck me:</p>

<p>1) there maybe needs to be just a little friction in the system, so that voters vote because they mean it; I've done several outreach events over the years where pre-booking was required and a commitment fee was levied to discourage people who had no intention of turning up - i.e. who had no stake in the event - taking up places; (the people who were 'cheating' in the EduBlog voting have demonstrated passion and commitment, if nothing else - maybe their votes should stand? ;-)</p>

<p>2) you need to think about what the voting units are - one person, one vote; one institution, one vote; etc. up front, and not keep moving the goal posts once the race has started (to mix wotsits and doo dahs...) Alternatively, maybe <a href="http://psychemedia.corank.com/">nomic voting</a> would be quite fun, where people are encouraged to suggest changes to how the votes are counted and calculated?</p>

<p>I don't know what the solution to the EduBlog Award voting palaver is, but I did start wondering what a 30 minute mashup polling solution might be, cobbled together out of tools and techniques familiar to bloggers...</p>

<p>... and my first attempt would include the following ingredients:</p>

<p>a) use of a <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">Captcha</a> or Typepad/OpenId login to provide a bit of friction to the affair, and cut down on the number of bot votes;<br />
b) use of a web stats tool to count unique visitors to a page that can only be reached via the Captcha;&nbsp; like Google analytics, perhaps, which will track unique visitors to a particular goal page, if you ask it nicely.</p>

<p>Alternatively, maybe there's a way of finessing a feed so that the number of people subscribing it could be interpreted as votes (the act of subscription providing the friction, in this case)? (Yes - I know, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011961.html">accurately measuring the number of feed subscribers is a pain</a>.)</p>

<p>I'd have a tinker with both of these approaches to see if a quick proof of concept is possible (or not), but Spooks is about to start...;-)</p>

<p>Disclaimer - this blog (<span style="font-style: italic;">OUseful.info</span>) has been (err, <span style="font-style: italic;">had been</span>?;-) <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012041.html">nominated</a> in this year's EduBlog Awards... Voting is currently claimed to be open until December 6th - unless they close it before the announced deadline to catch people sniping votes in the last few minutes, eBay style...?!;-)</p>

<h3 class="title">Surveillance 2.0?! - Logo Detection</h3>

<!--
<p>Three or four years ago, now, while I was still trying to find a way of using blogging tools that worked for me, I created a shortlived Blogger blog as a place to dump crazy techie ideas. One of those ideas was <a href="http://techietoys.blogspot.com/index.html#107556636857897683">Logo2icon</a>, which would turn logos that appeared in movies/tv programmes etc. into clickable icons (or would at least register the presence the brand logo and provide a navigation link through to an associated web page).</p>

<p>Here's what I read in the news today... <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7124735.stm">CCTV could track branded suspects</a></p>

<p>Brands on the clothes of suspects caught on CCTV cameras could be used to help police track them down.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police is looking into technology which can automatically identify branded logos on clothing.</p>

<p>Police believe that tracking suspects by their distinctive clothes will help cut down on the manual scanning of hundreds of hours of video footage.</p>

<p>The technology is already used to automatically identify company logos in TV broadcasts of sporting events.</blockquote><br />
With an increasing number of online TV catchup services, as well as internet TV services such as Joost providing players with various kinds of embedded and pop-up player controlas and additional services, it may be worth thinking again about how logo2icon services might work to surface links to web properties related to the content appearing on-screen?</p>

<p>Just for my own reference, here's some related readings:</p>

<p><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1290096">Trademark matching and retrieval in sports video databases</a> "describe[s] a system for detection and retrieval of trademarks appearing in sports videos"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.omniperception.com/products/magellan">OmniPerception Magellan</a> Automated Brand Analysis and Logo Detection software provides the tools necessary for the automatic identification, analysis and reporting of brand exposure and product placement in TV, film and other image communications media.</p>

<p>PS I still think <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010121.html">Re:Play - I'll take it from here</a> is a no-brainer...;-)<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/logo2icon" rel="tag">logo2icon</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>

<h3 class="title">Hierarchical Course Clusters from Course Profiles App</h3>

A couple of weeks ago, I got hold of a copy of the O'Reilly book Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. For anyone wanting to get started with 'intelligent' techniques for clustering data, building simple recommendation systems and so on,...
<!--
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I got hold of a copy of the O'Reilly book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-T-Segaran/dp/0596529325/?tag=ouseful-21">Programming Collective Intelligence</a> by <a href="http://kiwitobes.com/">Toby Segaran</a>. For anyone wanting to get started with 'intelligent' techniques for clustering data, building simple recommendation systems and so on, this book is joy to play with.</p>

<p>Filled with examples in Python (which is a language I've never really played with before... powerful, isn't it?! ;-) you can get 'sort of' working recommender systems up and running in minutes using only a few lines of code...</p>

<p>So - I had a bit of tinker last night with our original <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010855.html">Facebook Course Profiles app</a> data set collected from 700 or so anonymised users (the same data set I used to generate the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/011283.html">treemap displays</a>). The <span style="font-style: italic;">Collective Intelligence</span> book has an example of building a recommendation system based on delicious links that uses 'users' and 'urls' as the source data... so it was pretty trivial to recast the example to use 'users' and 'course codes' as the input data and build a proof of concept course recommendation system on that basis.</p>

<p>Liam has got another recommender system working in the dev version of the Facebook app already, so it'll be interesting to see if he used any of the heuristics I came up with for reducing the complete data set to a useful subset of data that was good for making recommendations (one strategy I used that looked okay at first glance was to rule out users who had declared less than five courses, and courses that occurred less than five times, from the recommender set).</p>

<p>The book also shows how Python can be used to generate simple visualisations of clustered data, for example. The first clustering algorithm explained in the book tries to cluster similar blogs based on the similarity of words used in them. Again, it was easy to map 'users' and 'course codes' on to 'urls' and 'words' features used in the example, and then reuse the reduced recommender data set (that is, the set based on users who had declared more than five courses which had also been declared more than five times), to see how courses were clustered by the Facebook app users .</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the Python JPG generating libraries working on my Mac yet (I'm not convinced everything is there...:-( but as the first data set I wanted to try to visualise was a hierarchical clustering, it struck me that I could use the <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind viewer</a> if I put the clustered hierarchy results into an appropriate XML form...</p>

<p>...so here's what the result looks like...</p>

<p><br />
<img style="width: 747px; height: 409px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2299/2083871776_4a907af087_o.png" /></p>

<p><br />
From the course codes, the clusters appear to be pretty sensible to me (bearing in mind the data set is quite small).</p>

<p>If you want to have play, here's the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/courseClustHierarchy.mm">Freemind file</a>.</p>

<p>Next coffee break, I'll have a go with the K-means clustering and maybe look at the data in a Many Eyes network diagram...<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/visualisation" rel="tag">visualisation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/clustering" rel="tag">clustering</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/freemind" rel="tag">freemind</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></p>
