<h3 class="title">VC's Forum - Towards a Global Online University (raw)</h3>

<p>The following are my raw notes form the VC's Global Online University forum held earlier this week.</p>

<p>I haven't had time, and probably won't have time <a href="http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/">;-)</a> to go through these for a week or two to try and make sense of them, so here they are, in all their glory.</p>

<p>For OU staff, I think the talks are replayable in the <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/berrill/">Berrill Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>-----------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Heppell</strong></p>

<p><br />
1996 - building big things<br />
2006 - Build things to help people to help each other</p>

<p>Lots of online essay-to-order websites, degrees for purchase, etc.</p>

<p>OU is about people:<br />
Originally - if you hate your job we'll help you get out of it. <br />
Now, if you love your job, we'll help you progress in it.</p>

<p>Communities of practise</p>

<p>21st century quality assurance</p>

<p>Global Online University is already here:<br />
high quality discourse, communities of (learning) practice, topic centred, project focussed  - gave example of online communities set up to discuss stratgey and tactics in run up to Round the Isalnd boat race.</p>

<p>a) do we want to be part of it?<br />
b) what are we contributing?<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Stephen Downes</strong></p>

<p>Should there be a global online university?</p>

<p>SD's visit here sandwiched between blog.ac.uk (personal publishing) and CETIS PLE event (PLEs created and owned by student, rather than a a particular institution).</p>

<p>Global - probably not.</p>

<p>Move towards distributed, decentralised network in which indivual are nodes and commincation links them together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain manifesto</a> - markets are changing from client-server model to a conversation. Consumers are involved in production of product.</p>

<p>Fishing rod tutor - buy a new fishing rod, try it out, the fishing rod says "you haven't fished before" and proceeds to instruct you. Learning travels with the environment or the artefact. Learning resources are part of background environment.</p>

<p>Web users starting to produce their own content/resource. With syndication(?), it starts to become an online educational resource.</p>

<p>Spontaneous online communities - common interest, background knowldge and expertise, ability and inclination to communicate - e.g. beekeeper group on Yahoo! groups.</p>

<p>This is the way of the future.</p>

<p>(Metauniversity/Charles Vest)</p>

<p>Four factors for network success:<br />
- diversity;<br />
- openness;<br />
- connectedness;<br />
- interaction/community.<br />
----------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - George Auckland, BBC</strong></p>

<p>Learn to let go - but really connect.</p>

<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/YoungGirl-OldWomanIllusion.html">Old lady/young woman illusion</a>:</p>

<p>BBC Education originally - old woman - started 1920s.</p>

<p>By 1928, realised learning needed to go beyond just broadcast.</p>

<p>Audiences are now changing: 1 in 3 don't think BBC makes programmes for them, 1 in 4 16-24 don't watch BBC. BUT GCSE Bitesize has 800, 000 userrs at this (revision) time of year.</p>

<p>Explosion of mdeia choice; move to on-demand viewing.</p>

<p>Need to realise full potential of any piece of content, exploit long tail: almost opposite of traditional broadcast model (large audience at time of broadcast).</p>

<p>360 degree exploitation:<br />
big wraparound of national broadcast - local broadcast, web sites, packs etc.</p>

<p>Big Ambition - all content available forever to be re-discovered, linked, clipped, built into other ideas.</p>

<p>How do you develop the brand with open source/content licensing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/create/">BBC Create</a><br />
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/archive/">BBC Open Schools Archive</a></p>

<p>IP is based on 'good ideas are hard to find' (Joe Kraus)  - is this still true? Has current IPR model had its day?</p>

<p>BBC has biggest/finest boradcast archibe in the world - the OU must have the HE equivalent.</p>

<p>Learn to let go of the content, but connect with the audience.</p>

<p>------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Yahoo! Research (pre-recorded video presentation)</strong></p>

<p>Important issues of web today are social networks, trust, reputation.</p>

<p>Social netowrking just one example of how net is self-organising to cope with growth of web.</p>

<p>Dealing with change is maybe main challenge of Yahoo today.</p>

<p>We don't know how the web will evolve, nor ways of accessing it.</p>

<p>TV had potential to become a force in education, but it has arguably, largely drifted away from that. Hopefully, the web will not evolve in the same way.</p>

<p>Content should not only be open, it should also be discoverable.</p>

<p>Difference between 'free' and 'open'.</p>

<p>To date, advertising has been dominant commercial model. ROI on advertising is measureable by measuring click-thru and consequrent purchase (opens up potential for affiliate based business models (e.g. Amazon Associates) as well as advertising).</p>

<p>--------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Malcolm Ross, Merlin Consulting</strong></p>

<p>Mobile/telecoms consultancy.</p>

<p>Telecoms scenarios for 2020 and potential impact on the way the OU operates as a business.</p>

<p>Telecoms tech: ICT is delivery enabler for HE. Effectively no performance limits on what is achievable.</p>

<p>Moore's law, Kryder's law (hard disk capacity), Gilder's law (bandwidth).</p>

<p>Morita - if you set a low enough size and cost point for a product someone will manage it.</p>

<p>Most thought should focus on areas where uncertainty is highest and impact on the current business model is biggest.</p>

<p>2D map - impact on one acces, uncertainty on another. Scenario planning has high imapct, high uncertainty focus.</p>

<p>Four basic scenarios based on supply and demand developments (2 axes again):</p>

<p>Supply - few gloabl players to many/everyone can do it.<br />
Demand - simple, generic, free to custom</p>

<p>Shouldn't try to predict an accepted future, rather come up with strategies that are robust for any mix of likely futures.</p>

<p>Robust strategies for 2020:<br />
- monetise staff, student and alumni; (linking people together for added value);<br />
- who's the teacher, who's the educator; leverage OU community as virtual consulting business;</p>

<p>?evolvability - imagine, create content, that may be sold but openly licensed. Other prope change the cotnent over time but its origin as my IPR is retained within metadata. In time, none of my original words are there, but I am still in metadata and still get some revenue when the content is sold. -> get returns for creating evolvable content.</p>

<p>=-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Werner Vogels, Amazon</strong></p>

<p>Digital Revolution:<br />
- the world is changing from hard to find knowledge/expert, to plentiful, reasliy available;<br />
- the changes are fundamental - personal expression, daily living, work and play, affecting culture, artistic expression, societal norms.</p>

<p>First phase of industrial revolution was mass production of steel. This was the enabler.<br />
In info revolution, still in phase 1.</p>

<p>Paradigm shift - <br />
business moving from monolith to ecosystem, move to platform, support customisatiomn (let users customise your business as they experience it); move from broadcast to viral, brochure to conversation; business moves from hierarchy to flat becuase information is becoming available to all.<br />
Amazon revolves around customer reviews.<br />
Customers have perfect information - if you aren;t to be trusted, customers will find out.<br />
Customers becoming sellers as well as buyers.<br />
Consumers moving from consumers to producers.</p>

<p><a href="http://istockphoto.com/index.php">iStockphoto</a> - killing traditional stock photo services.</p>

<p>We are still at day one. However:<br />
 - the internet is increasingly imprtant;<br />
 - for kids, thinjgs like Amazon have always been there. Information has always been completely available for them.</p>

<p>The kids will drive the second phase.</p>

<p>Info management skills will become ESSENTIAL.<br />
Understanding how things like reputation  (top hit on Google etc) are constructed.</p>

<p>---------------------------------<br />
<strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Michael Stevenson, DfES</strong></p>

<p>How might government see HE context wrt global online university.</p>

<p>Increased participation.</p>

<p>HE is a big business - so don't destabilise it. UK HE sector quite conservative.</p>

<p>90% of HEI are reliant on govt for at least 1/3 of funding. Resisting adoption of new technology - odd dabblings, but nothing revolutionary.<br />
BUT student body coming into HE with significant prior experience of online community and practice.</p>

<p>How do we unleash student demand further?<br />
How do we address financing?<br />
How do we get HEIs to collaborate?<br />
Greater role for private sector?<br />
How to engage employers?<br />
How to drive international expansion while protecting UK HE brand.</p>

<p>African educational development.<br />
Sustainable development.</p>

<p>Global online university would have to be built out of global partnerships - HE, IT companies (GYM etc.), content producers (e.g. BBC), cultural sectors.</p>

<p>Need for a business model (but impractical in developing world).</p>

<p>Should start with the greatest ambition but modest first steps.</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Riita Vanska, Nokia</strong></p>

<p>Use of mobile techniology in developing world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4126776">Bridge<em>it</em></a> - teachers order content via SMS, which is delivered overnight via satellite.<br />
<a href="http://mobiled.uiah.fi/?page_id=2">MobilED</a> - just utilising audio; audio connection to Wikipedia.<br />
(<a href="http://press.nokia.com/PR/200511/1021392_5.html">Village phone</a> - knowledge sharing)</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Svava Bjarnason, Observatory on Borderless Higher Education</strong></p>

<p>Why bother we a Global Online U?<br />
 - the context;<br />
 - the reality;<br />
 - the questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/">OBHE</a> - An International Strategic Info Service.<br />
- descriptive info;<br />
- strategic info.</p>

<p>Why GOU? - is it part of open content movement?<br />
 - capacity building in other countries?<br />
 - increasing student market?<br />
- building new research partnerships?</p>

<p>Online/tech is NOT ubiquitous. Connectivity is not available to all outside North America and Europe. In global context, English is not necessarily the dominant language.</p>

<p>Golbal HE - investment required, distribution of risk when working in partnership, balance of opportunity vs. strategy and/or tradition vs. innovation; need to be in long game for tangible results.</p>

<p>How global is global? Is China global on its own?</p>

<p>Is it wholly online or blended?<br />
Is it about altruism or is it market driven? (is this a necessary <em>or</em>, or is it a possible <em>and</em>?<br />
- partners - global or regional?)</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Alistair Shrimpton, Skype</strong></p>

<p>Skype want to enable the world's conversations.<br />
Skype perceive themselves as enablers - product development is key.<br />
Global product and global point of view.</p>

<p>One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.</p>

<p>Conversations are more than just about voice.</p>

<p>Cluetrain manifesto: 'markets are conversations'.</p>

<p>Skype - small company in terms of staff; 1% of users using paid for services keep it free for the rest (85% of whom don't realise paid for services are available).</p>

<p>Aim to make the hard look easy - hide the hard stuff from the user.</p>

<p>Skype champions privacy, very secure ('military grade' security).</p>

<p>Skype - built around extremely rapid innovation. Product development is what Skype do.</p>

<p>Locally disruptive. If you think something will happen, get their first...</p>

<p>Open APIs, active developer community.</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Chris Yapp, Microsoft</strong></p>

<p>"How can a global online university maximise the potential for good?"</p>

<p>So what's the challenge?</p>

<p>- the world is becoming increasingly project driven rather than insitutionally driven?</p>

<p>So identify the challenge, then work out what collaborations and partnerships are required to address the challenge.</p>

<p>Fundamental challenge appears to hooking up reserch that solves problems to people who need the knowledge via teaching of the research knowledge at all levels.</p>

<p>So - become a portal to global knowledge base.</p>

<p>Glolbal online knowledge bank exploited by GOU/teaching instituion to address fundamental challenges in maximising public good.</p>

<p>-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>VC's Forum (Global University) - Q & A</strong></p>

<p>JC - radical business model change seems to be required, but what is the model for that?</p>

<p>VC - we have been thinking about business models for serveral years, but won;t be something to happen overnight. Need for largescale pilot.</p>

<p>WV - focus on core competencies and commoditise those. Play to your strengths. Amazon stength is playing at scale [as is OU]. Continue to do what you're good at but in new ways.</p>

<p>Can a transition from trad-business to e-business be evolutionary rather than evolutionary.<br />
VC - a step-change, switch from one model to the other would be hard to achieve. BUT difficult to maintain two business models (one old, one new) side-by-side.<br />
SH - we know HE has its problems, but if we don't fix it perhaps an upstart will (cf. Ryan Air) and their disruption may not be better.<br />
WV - who is the customer? are we really serving our customers, where offerings are ubiquitous, and it becomes possible to mix-and-match.<br />
SD - it is possible to be innovated out of existence. Need to ask why we are doing what we do, what the purpose/point is. OU is trying to accomplish a social value/goal.</p>

<p>MarcE - a fundamental change is happening but education typically doesn't grok it wholesale and may adopt technology bits piecemeal. How does HE go for it? Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time? <br />
SH - if you hit the tough targets, you've got it made. Size is everything. OU has the scale to make the play. 18 months to make the play. The curve is accelerating - it really is this time.<br />
WV - is a global university a desirable thing? If so, te online is almost a given.<br />
SD - Why should we believe the revolution is happening this time?  Because this time they are making laws against it, which suggests it is ubiquitous.<br />
MS - if it's to happen, 3 things required: 1) people need to come together; if GOU, it needs government and corporate support; maybe transformation over 10-15 yr period and when we look back it will have happened.<br />
CY - who isn't here? People like GSK who have to operate across regions, across skill sets etc.<br />
WV - arts and creative industries need representation.<br />
SB - there is momentum this time; many HE people investing in online learning to enhance campus experience NOT a global market. So - now may be the time when we could have first mover advantage towards  GOU.<br />
VC - common sense dictates we need to stop reinventing Physics 101, Maths 101 etc.</p>

<p>Does current funding model support the investement necessary to go wholesale for a new technology solution? What management structure can support this level of change?</p>

<p>AS - someone has got to just go and do it, and be disruptive. SHould 8 people from the panel go away, lock themselves in a room, and make a decision about what's gonna happen by the end of the week? Yes - absolutely.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>??]</p>

<p>WV - release early, release often.<br />
MR - with 1 million alumni and 200k students, the OU should turn itself into a business...<br />
CY - HE sector is likely to have individual institutions failing. HE has the desire to do everything in a vertical organisation. If you can't be world class in a particular area, get someone else to it.<br />
SD - what's the goal? To get everybody educated for free? SO ask the question: what do we need to do to move ourselves to wards that goal, or the goal of free education for everybody in the world.</p>

<p>[Google want to organise the world's knowledge; skype want to get evryone talking. Should we want to be striving for 'A free education for everyone' .]</p>

<p>SH - alumni are assets. and the OU has lots of alumni.<br />
MR - education has to be paid for by the future wealth it creates; cf. microcredit arrangements where the introduction of mobile phones increases the wealth of the village.</p>

<p>JN - two strands: 1) how to reinvent the OU; 2) does the idea of a Global University make sense? The idea of the OU metamorphosing into into a GOU make sense - no; a global oU would have to be a networked organisation and whilst the OU might be a seed crystal it can;t be the final thing.<br />
MR - the process of producing content is an important part of the seed corn contribution.<br />
SH - it may not be the OU who does this, but the alternative is scarey...the OU has quality process etc. etc and the alternatives don't necessarily have those built in in the way they are built in to the OU. <br />
WV - being first is hard. Being number 25 is easy- - it's just copying. To be first will be incredibly hard. Does global also mean delivering Polish content in UK?<br />
CY - Need to get the best brains here in an R&D centre to crack the problem.<br />
MS - the OU could and should have a role - the ethos, appreciation of the importance of partnership, etc. Need to pull in government becuase as well as cash, government IS influential.<br />
SD - it is unlikely for there to be a single thing that would be the GU. A GU is unlikely to be a content delivery vehicle. The model will be learning and community model, learning as conversation, or communities of practice model. Commercial focus is on product, but learning is about conversation not product.  </p>

<p>?? - How do academics as designers of learning experiences fit into the model? What are my job prospects?<br />
PM - Amazon is 24-7, whereas HE has scheduled start dates. How do we move to the 24-7 model?<br />
?? - radical change is proposed, but our current model is highly regarded? How do we avoid throwing the baby out with ithe bathwater? Should we start a new venture?</p>

<p>WV - digital stuff is not necessarily good, because it brings with it attention deficit, and difficulty in making decisions. Teachers may move away from being content producers to guides.<br />
CY - potential market that is currently poorly served is the over-50s.</p>
