<!--
<p>In my recent post on the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010513.html">OpenMark Computer-Assisted Assessment Tool</a>, I described an open source electronic assessment system that has been developed - and is actually used - here at the OU to support our course assessment strategies.</p>

<p>As well as <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/">Open Mark</a>, the OU also hosts an <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/assessment/pages/tma-submission-methods.php">electronic assignment handling system</a> (the "eTMA system") that allows students to upload electronic copies of Office documents as submissions to an assignment and an eCMA system that provides computer based marking for multiple choice assessments (I haven't checked recently whether this is (still?!;-) based on students completing an OCR form that they have to post in to the OU, whence it is scanned in for electronic marking...)</p>

<p>One problem we have had until now is that as course team members we have been unable to see what our students see when using these assessment systems. For a start, we're staff, with staff authentication and corresponding staff access permissions. Added to which, we're not students registered on the courses we're actually running, so we don't have student permissions or access to the electronic assessment systems... After years of asking, it seems that this year the Technology Short Course Program course teams are going to get access to a dummy student account, which means that for the first time we'll be able to get a valid 'student experience' of our course materials - and hopefully the assessment systems too...</p>

<p>One issue that anecdotally keeps cropping up about the eTMA ad eCMA systems is that there is little feedback provided when you have uploaded an assignment  and it is often difficult to tell whether everything has worked okay (not being a registered student on any of our courses means I haven't been able to personally check this...).</p>

<p>This was brought home to me recently whilst marking a batch of scripts when I opened one script to find it was for the wrong course. (There were - and always are - several half-completed scripts too, and I'm never really sure whether these have been deliberately submitted as a final offering, or were an early, 'holding position' upload that hasn't been replaced by a later resubmission.)</p>

<p>What would be useful, I think, would be a 'preview' facility to show students what they have uploaded - something like the document viewer you find in <a href="http://scribd.com">Scribd</a>, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099430044050392706"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTQm2yUBoI/AAAAAAAAAeg/4tTxdEPfAt4/s800/scibd.png" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, this sort of facility would be useful all round, for markers as well as students.</p>

<p>Every time I mark scripts submitted via the eTMA system, I always get one that uses a 'different' document format. I don't remember what sort of submitted filetype it was this time round that I couldn't open on my desktop, but I do know I had to resort to viewing it in Google docs (which presumably breaks all sorts of OU rules?).</p>

<p>Added to the filetype problem (which really should be defended against - we specify the range of 'approved' document types in several places, so why doesn't the eTMA system check for these and warn the student that they have uploaded a file that their marker may not be able to open?) I occasionally wonder about virus issues - does the eTMA system automatically scan all uploaded files? And if so, what does it do if it finds an infection?</p>

<p>Using a system like the one adopted by Scribd, students would be able to check that they had uploaded what they intended to submit for an assignment, and markers could either view the file online, or download it using one of the (common!) supported formats. A commenting system could also be used to allow markers to comment back on the assignment to the learner.</p>

<p>The viewing technology could also be reused in our online course materials, as well as in student portfolios (speaking of which, Guy Carberry is soliciting comments on the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/guycarberry/?p=192">latest design iteration for MyStuff</a>...).</p>

<p><small>PS That's definitely it for a week or two, now... Let the holiday commence :-)</small></p>

<p>Some time ago, I posted about an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010382.html">Institutional Dashboard Using Pageflakes</a> that crudely demonstrated how Pageflakes might be used as glanceable institutional news display.</p>

<p>It was quite gratifying to find out a couple of weeks ago that someone else here has had a go at producing their own dashboard - Jed Cawthorne's <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/ecm">ECM Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099414088246888018"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTCGGyUBlI/AAAAAAAAAdY/t4tNOuiqH-M/s800/pageflakesJedECM1.png" /></a></p>

<p>The 'topic tabs' all employ the same layout - an informative, explanatory sidebar and two columns containing feed panels from several relevant blogs:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5099414109721724514"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RsTCHWyUBmI/AAAAAAAAAdg/TafF6SHzUzA/s800/pageflakesJedECM2.png" /></a><br />
<small>[Oops - "thats" a typo ;-) ]</small></p>

<p>There's a lot going on ECMwise in the OU at the moment, so it's interesting to see OUr developments in the context of the wider world, as illustrated by the ECM dashboard.</p>

<p><br />
PS While on the topic of webtops, I'm not sure that I ever posted about the <a href="http://conclave.open.ac.uk/openair/?p=103">launch of the OpenLearn Netvibes Universe</a>? </p>

<p>You can find it here: <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/openlearn">http://www.netvibes.com/openlearn</a></p>

<p>There are tabs for each of the OpenLearn topic areas, containing listings of all the units associated with a topic as well as sample materials for some of the areas. OpenLearn will be opening up a whole range of RSS feeds in the Autumn, so it'll be interesting to see whether or not OpenLearn feeds start appearing on independently produced webtops...</p>

<p>PPS <a href="http://www.open2.net/clickon/index.html">Click On</a> returns to Radio 4 in September, although it's moving away from Wednesday night broadcast to a Monday afternoon slot... "Webtops" are going to feature in the <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a> support offering for the programme, so stay tuned to find out more...</p>

<p>(All six programmes from the first series of Click On are available as listen again Real Audio streams (Real Audio player required). To hear these programmes again, check out this demo <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/stringleClickOnDemo&amp;s=http://www.open2.net/clickon&amp;o=http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/clickonStringleDemo.opml">Click On Stringle page</a>.)</p>

<p>Earlier today, I had to combine a couple of abstracts I'd put in to the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007">OpenLearn Conference</a> for the single speaking slot I've been allocated. Although I normally keep everything, I couldn't track down either of the abstracts for quite some time, so I mailed the organisers to see if they could let me have copies back (unfortunately, the abstracts weren't on the conference website - I checked; and come to that, the same is true for the abstract of the presentation I'm giving at <a href="http://www.internet-librarian.com/">Internet Librarian International 2007</a>, which I also appear to have, err, misplaced...!)</p>

<p>Anyway, assuming that I'm likely to have trouble tracking the new abstract down when I come to prepare my presentation in the <s>hours</s>, err, <em>days</em> (okay, Patrick? ;-) before the OpenLearn conference (30-31 October 2007), here it is... just in case...<br />

<strong>Feeding from Open Courseware - Exploring the Potential of Open Educational Content Delivery Using RSS Feeds.</strong><br />
Tony Hirst<br />
Faculty of Technology, The Open University</p>

<blockquote>Abstract
An implicit aim of many opencourseware projects, including OpenLearn, is to encourage the informal use of open educational resources, as well as its reuse. In this presentation, I shall describe several examples of how open courseware can be disaggregated into component parts that can be easily shared and republished using RSS and OPML web feeds.

<p>From 'daily learning chunks' delivered to candidate PLEs such as PageFlakes using a Web 2.0 mashup to mobile access, this approach can also be used to turn bibliographies into online bookstores and provide a way of displaying media assets in a rich media slideshow.</blockquote><br />
The original wave of opencourseware initiatives, such as MIT's OpenCourseware project, sought to make high quality educational resources available for reuse and repurposing by whosoever wanted to avail themselves of that content. More recent thinking implies that just providing the content is not enough. Approaches such as OpenLearn provide a learning environment around the content that can provide personal learning support tools and support the formation of learning communities and.</p>

<p>Although providing 'reuse and remix' opportunities forms part of the war cry for the OER community, few demonstrations of just how the content may be used in such a way are offered. In the same way that the learning object economy that was much heralded by educational technologists never seemed to be as successful as was originally hoped, is it possible that the hoped for reuse and remix of OERs will similarly fail to take off (Lamb, 2007)?<br />
 <br />
The granularity at which open courseware content is typically published - the course, or course unit - makes it difficult to consume bite size chunks of content easily, and arguably makes it difficult to discover reusable or remixable items of content.</p>

<p>As I have written elsewhere, '[t]he easiest remix is not really a remix at all, and barely counts as a reuse, though it is a republish or represent - just take a direct copy of someone else's content and make it your own property/publish it on your own site, in your own content area' (Hirst, 2007).</p>

<p>At the simplest level, exposing open educational content via an RSS feed immediately opens up this republishing opportunity.</p>

<p>Taking a lead from social websites such as youTube and flickr, where content can be shared at a fine level of granularity (the movie or picture level) as well as at an aggregated level (a playlist or photostream), I shall describe several implemented examples of how both MIT Open CourseWare courses, and Open University OpenLearn units, can be disaggregated into component parts and then republished in a syndicated way using OPML and RSS feeds, as well as through social networks.</p>

<p>One advantage of making content available via RSS is the wide variety of pre-existing tools that are capable of consuming RSS feeds. For example, it is possible to consume RSS feeds RSS readers (e.g. Bloglines or Google Reader) or webtops (e.g. Netvibes, iGoogle or PageFlakes), as well as republishing content in RSS format as PDF documents, or even audio files. Mobile support for RSS feeds is also widespread.</p>

<p>However, the use of RSS feeds as a significant route for publishing OER content does not seem to be widely recognised. For example, the Open Educational Practices and Resources. OLCOS Roadmap 2012 (Geser, 2007) uses its section entitled 'RSS feeds enrich educational portals and learners can subscribe directly to thematic content feeds' to refer more to the way learners can aggregate content around a particular topic from formal and informal publishers, such as news services and bloggers, without suggesting that OER providers themselves might publish educational content in this way. This in part reflects the mindset that RSS is used to publish changeable content or content that is regularly updated, as opposed to providing a way to syndicate fixed or static content, such as unchanging course material.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I will describe the process by which early demonstration RSS feeds for OpenLearn content were generated from the original OpenLearn XML content and MIT OCW web pages using various third party online tools. Essentially, this is just republishing the materials in the RSS medium, in addition to the HTML pages or printable PDF documents that are typically made available.</p>

<p>This "RSSified" content can be used as the basis for republishing and remixing the content by third party users, or consuming it in the location of their choice. For example, RSS versions of course units can be viewed using candidate personal learning environment "webtops" such as Netvibes and PageFlakes, or distributed as "daily learning chunks" using OpenLearn_daily, a Web 2.0 mashup involving OpenLearn and Yahoo Pipes; and simple content remixes can be derived using RSS feed filters and simple content analysis tools.</p>

<p>Reusing or repurposing material at the level of granularity with which it is published (that is, at the course or unit level) is problematic on several counts: the physical format of the materials may not be appropriate, the way multiple topics covered by the materials are bundled together may not deliver the correct storyline for the person wishing to reuse (elements of) the course, the materials may not have the correct blend of media assets for the intended reuse, and so on.</p>

<p>By disaggregating content and individual assets and republishing them as separate items in a single RSS feed, the component parts of a course can be made available as a cleanly packaged bundle of separate items without the need for heavyweight packaging formats.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, I will show how an MIT OCW course can be atomised in such a way that bibliographic information and media assets related to course examples can be republished via shareable, rich media feeds, and how the course as a whole can be disaggregated into component parts that can then be republished in aggregated form using an OPML feed.<br />
 <br />
I will also describe an automated process for treating an OpenLearn course unit in XML form as a database that can be "mined" - or "asset stripped" - in several different ways to expose particular components of the course, such as link collections or image collections. The link collections can then be used to seed custom search engines, and media assets can be passed into course related photostreams or online radio channels.</p>

PS Not having any 'proper' references to hand (as requested by several referees of the original abstracts who didn't hint at what those references might be, or even where they might come from), I put out a shout to a couple of people who work in the area to see if they had any good ones to hand. Apparently not... Now I used to be a real academic reference junky (honestly!) back in my PhD days, although even then I'd be as likely to cite a pre-print or technical report I'd found on an individual's web page as something from a heavyweight (= slow turnaround) journal. But now? I am soooooooooo out of the formal literature and don't even know what conferences or workshop series to follow, let alone what journals to read ... So if you do know offhand of any good references that might bolster the above, can you, err, please mail me link or DOI? Or share me the link via delicious? Ta muchly... (I'll give you an acknowledgment, of course :-)</p>

<!--
<p>So I finally got a Wii and after a fun evening putting my shoulder out playing golf and pulling a muscle that makes it painful to sit down playing baseball, I got the Wii online: after a bit of faffing around searching for a MAC address for my router (it's one of the Wii settings menu) the Wii sniffed out the Wifi network and autodiscovered the security model, then prompted me for my Wifi network password.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a browser as one of the Wii internet channels (weather and the news appear to be the defaults) but I'm a couple of months too late on that one - it seems the free-to-download Opera browser offer ran out at the end of June, so I had to pop along to the Wii online shop to buy some Wii points - 1000 for 7 quid - of which I then spent 500 on the <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/devices/nintendo/">Wii internet channel/Opera browser</a>.</p>

<p>Google and Yahoo are both offered as pre-favourited search options, but I was more interested in the extent to which I could use the Wii as a media center for streamed web content using Wii optimised websites (minimal text, large buttons, clean interface).</p>

<p>This helpful post on <a href="http://www.last100.com/2007/06/25/five-resources-to-create-a-wii-media-center/">Five resources to create a Wii media center</a> turned up <a href="http://finetune.com/wii/">Finetune</a>, an online music streaming service that delivers tunes by music type or artist (in the same sense that Last.fm creates a radio station by artist - i.e. it's mainly <em>musically related</em> artists...)</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5098707115181680674"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RsI_G24pKCI/AAAAAAAAAcI/8twzEcFqLHM/s800/wiiFinetune.png" /></a></p>

<p>I'm listening to Ozric Tentacles at the moment, via <em>Hawkwind Radio</em> :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5098707132361549890"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RsI_H24pKEI/AAAAAAAAAcY/ADwCvlljDPY/s800/wiiFinetune2.png" /></a></p>

<p>Another site I have added to my Wii favourites list is <a href="http://viewii.com">Viewii</a>, a Wii optimised front-end to Youtube:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5098707123771615282"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RsI_HW4pKDI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/b5-C9tVHwDQ/s800/wiiViewii.png" /></a></p>

<p>The first thing I tuned in to was the <em>Machine is Us/ing Us</em> video, which seemed to play okay (not brilliantly, but okay...) on a big screen...</p>

<p>Earlier in the evening, we'd had a play on the Wii Photo Channel, which runs a slideshow of photos from a camera SD memory card. I didn't work out at the time how to add our own soundtrack, but I'm sure it can't be that hard.</p>

<p>My daughter also built a couple of custom Mii avatars - one for herself and one for a friend. Glancing at the manual, it seems you can 'export' these to a Wiimote handset, and then offload them onto someone else's console. I knew that Mii characters could traverse the net, and visit friend's consoles that way, but being able to use a Wiimote as a vector is a very neat idea :-)</p>

<p>The Wii has been a joy to set up so far - with generally helpful and intuitive interfaces - although I'm a little wary about much we might spend buying casual games for it... (I'd buy <a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/">flOw</a> for it any day of the week...)</p>

<p>For some time now, the OU has been running a "computer-assisted assessment system" on some of our courses using an in-house system known as <em>OpenMark</em>. The project is actually made available as an open source project, which you can find at <a href="https://openmark.dev.java.net/">https://openmark.dev.java.net/</a>.<br />
<blockquote>OpenMark differs from traditional CAA systems in:<br />
    * The emphasis we place on feedback. All Open University students are distance learners and within the university we emphasise the importance of giving feedback on written assessments. The design of OpenMark assumes that feedback, perhaps at multiple levels, will be included.<br />
    * Allowing multiple attempts. OpenMark is an interactive system, and consequently we can ask students to act on feedback that we give 'there and then', while the problem is still in their mind. If their first answer is incorrect, they can have an immediate second, or third, attempt.<br />
    * The breadth of interactions supported. We aim to use the full capabilities of modern multimedia computers to create engaging assessments.<br />
    * The design for anywhere, anytime use. OpenMark assessments are designed to enable students to complete them in their own time in a manner that fits with normal life. They can be interrupted at any point and resumed later from the same location or from elsewhere on the internet.</blockquote><br />
You can see an example of OpenMark in action at <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/">http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/</a>.</p>

<p>OpenMark is capable of serving a variety of question formats, including:<br />
<ul><li><em>generative, numeric response type</em> questions that use random numbers to provide unique questions of a given form and can accept answers as integers, floating point numbers or numbers in scientific format (with or without units):<br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5098609610834126834"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RsHmbW4pJ_I/AAAAAAAAAbA/v_hPDeyembA/s800/openMarkNumeric.png" /></a></li><br />
<li><em>text response type</em> questions, either closed (that is, "designed to elicit a single, closely defined, response") or "that appear to be 'open', encouraging the student to enter a phrase or sentence", with assessment based on keyword/phrase matching;</li><br />
<li>variations on multiple choice questions, including single or multiple response questions, drag and drop words onto images or words within words question types:<br />

<p>OpenMark is built using Java and "is based around two servlets: the question engine and the test navigator. The test navigator deals with all direct communication with students, handles authentication, and handles details of tests - which question comes when, any explanatory information, and so on. Question engines deal only with the actual processing behind questions and do not communicate directly with the user or with the database that records user actions. All the question code runs on question engines.<br />
"A [third] question author servlet, installed on the author's machine, allows them to compile and test questions [without the need for an IDE]."</p>

<p>Questions are defined using XML according to a bespoke XML schema, with Java code determining the required feedback and score calculation.</p>

<p>I seem to recall seeing a note somewhere that the VLE demo site - and with it my (old and dated) <a href="http://vledemo.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=69">Moodle playground demo site</a> (login as guest) - may not be around forever, so I thought I'd better start raiding various things I've posted there and keep them archived by links I have access to!</p>

<p>So here's a quickie for now: <a href="http://phoenixweb.open.ac.uk/%7ETony_Hirst/tu120animationDemo/">three examples of using Google suggest</a>, originally produced as an illustrative example for the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120 Beyond Google</a> course team.</p>

<p>Why three? Because they demonstrate Google suggest/live search suggestions using three different techniques - a screencast, an animated GIF, and a slideshow.</p>

<p>Here's the animated GIF:</p>

<p><img src="http://phoenixweb.open.ac.uk/%7ETony_Hirst/tu120animationDemo/gSuggest.gif" alt="Google suggest animation: car valeting" /></p>

<p>PS if you're wondering why the blog's been a bit quiet for the last few days, it's because we've been away, taking in the <a href="http://www.bristolfiesta.co.uk/">Bristol Balloon Fiesta</a> on one of the days...</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jIhxCW7QM1U"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jIhxCW7QM1U" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>We saw over 60 balloons go up on the Saturday evening, and then hung around for the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=jIhxCW7QM1U">night glow and fireworks</a> :-)</p>

<p>Getting out was a pain though - we were deep in the on-the-day car park, and having got back to the car didn't turn the engine on for 90 minutes, eventually leaving some time after midnight... :-(</p>

<p>An email from Microsoft alerted me to their take on mapping the Foot and Mouth outbreak, presumably given I haven't referenced them in my previous posts on the topic (such as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010507.html">this one on adding weather information to the emergency map</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5096318713933146050"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RrnC3m4pJ8I/AAAAAAAAAZ0/Ecp2WNsm0bg/s800/footMouthMicrosoft.png" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://maps.live.com/?v=2&amp;cid=5765BC650CFBA6F6%21158&amp;encType=1">Foot and mouth zones on Microsoft Live Maps</a></p>

<p>I can't get the 3D view to work on my Mac, even on XP under Parallels 3, so if anyone can let me have a screen shot of that, it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I haven't really looked at Live maps before, but they do seem to provide a set of drawing tools so you can create your own overlays.</p>

<p>It also looks like you can add pushpins from the Collections menu, though, and save them if you are signed in to a live.com account.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://maps.live.com/GeoCommunity.aspx?action=retrieverss&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;cid=5765BC650CFBA6F6%21158">feed from the map</a> provides a GeoRSS view of the map, which is handy; it <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fmaps.live.com%2FGeoCommunity.aspx%3Faction%3Dretrieverss%26mkt%3Den-us%26cid%3D5765BC650CFBA6F6%21158&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=8&amp;om=1">seems to work in Google maps</a>, too, after a fashion (not all the pins appear) ;-)</p>

<p>Maybe I need to take have a bit of a play with this...</p>

<!--
<p>A recent TechCrunch post that included a <a href="&visit=15020594"><em>Casual Immersive Worlds</em> Comparison Chart</a> set the cat amongst the pigeons (again) on the question of - you guessed it - educators' use of Second Life... Here's one example - the latest post in ding-dong between Peter Miller and Scott Wilson: <a href="http://tidalblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/now-im-in-wrong-metaverse.html">Now I'm in the wrong metaverse... :-)</a></p>

<p>Regular readers have probably guessed that I'm not much of a fan of Second Life (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010299.html">So That's What Second Life's for...</a>) but maybe that's just because it's not one of "my" discovered toys and I'm not trying to evangelise it in anyway, (a bit like with Compendium...).</p>

<p>Or maybe it's because I see people putting resource and effort into it because they fell for media hype, without really thinking about what they're trying to achieve? Chat with avatars, rather than video or plain text is about all I can see in it...! ;-) (so why not stick with video and morph things around a bit, augmented reality style, like <a href="http://www.fix8.com">fix8</a> does! (It even works with standard IM clients, I think? You do need a webcam though...))</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I posted this into a course team conference where Second Life was mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>Second Life will be interesting over the next few weeks; <a href="http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2007/07/26/linden-lab-outlaws-second-life-gambling/">gambling has just been outlawed in world</a>, and whilst the repercussions may not be so much that areas of SL get cleaned up, the authoritarian and "arbitrary" way that Linden Lab imposed the changes <em>may</em> have knock-on effects...

<p>[How is it, by the way, that institutions are set against services like Google docs and Netvibes "because they might disappear" and do not apply the same argument to Second Life - which consumes way more effort and is not the most open of environments?]</p>

<p>Of course, of the millions of registered SL users, most never make it off the orientation island...</p>

<p>Just by the by - IBM are doing a lot with virtual worlds. They also just brought out a set of <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2007/07/27/ibm-virtual-world-guidelines/">'guidelines' for IBMers who go into virtual worlds...</a> </p>

<p>Virtual worlds possibly are important for education - but Second Life as a relatively early stage single provider may not be the best place to go to... although experience gained in there may well prove valuable in the longer term...</p>

<p>3 or 4 months ago a lot of education people got a heads-up about social networking in MySpace, which arguably helped set up/made possible the current educational buzz/interest that is currently happening around Facebook.</p>

<p>SL arguably got the current wave of interest in online, non-gameplay (ie not MMORPG) 3d environments going, supported in no small part by a mainstream media who didn't look elsewhere and don't like MMORPGs (Entropia universe is gaining ground and World of Warcraft is huge)... </p>

<p>But I suspect there's going to be whole raft of rivals arriving online *if* 3d chat environment/social meeting space worlds continue to appear to be attractive....</p>

<p>I'm also guessing SL will be surpassed in terms of interest and engagement if the technology supports it (bandwidth, graphics and so on). </p>

<p>Microsoft  (Silverlight), Adobe (Air) and Google (Gears was a start but only a small one) are all exploring technologies that support increasingly rich interfaces and/or allow web/desktop synching and offline use of what are apparently online apps; and vice versa - <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070726-090113.php">Google Earth enterprise now works via a browser</a> for example, and Microsoft Virtual Earth already works in a Windows browser environment.</p>

<p>These new approaches may provide the platform basis for a more usable 3d web experience; i.e. the next generation of 3D web browsing.</blockquote></p>

<p>So here are what I think are interesting ;-)</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/index.php/Main_Page">Open Croquet</a> (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=oKi-fkyAtg8">video demo</a>) - "a powerful open source software development environment for the creation and large-scale distributed deployment of multi-user virtual 3D applications and metaverses that are (1) persistent (2) deeply collaborative, (3) interconnected and (4) interoperable. The Croquet architecture supports synchronous communication, collaboration, resource sharing and computation among large numbers of users on multiple platforms and multiple devices."

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oKi-fkyAtg8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oKi-fkyAtg8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>What I like about Open Croquet is that the worlds run on your own machine, and you can then hook them into other worlds running on other people's machines, peer-to-peer style.<br />
</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.multiverse.net/">Multiverse</a> - "Multiverse lets you to build an MMOG or virtual world for less money and in less time than ever before. Multiverse technology is scalable, extensible, and highly customizable, enabling you to build your world with its own unique look and feel, gameplay, and mechanics. ... Download our client, server, tools, starter assets, and sample worlds for free and start building your world today!"</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/I9w9hFuZKD8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/I9w9hFuZKD8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>The twist with Multiverse is that users are provided with a single client (a 3D world browser, in effect) that can be used to connect to any world in the Multiverse, err, multiverse. </li></ul></p>

<p>It's worth remembering too that the IT heavyweights are looking at this sort of technology, as in the case of <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/mc/mpk20.html">Sun Microsystems' MKK30 Virtual Workplace</a>.</p>

<p>And Google and Microsoft may both end up there, after a fashion, with their respective "Earth" products... (for example, check out <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/modelcycle?scoring=d&hl=en">Model Vision</a>, a live map showing recent uploads to the Google Earth 3D model Sketchup Warehouse).</p>

<p>PS the ultimate, of course, would be <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_33/b4046064.htm">an avatar that works across all virtual worlds</a>...</p>

<!--
<p>Over the weekend, I had a little play with some sample data sets in Many Eyes, just in case I manage to get hold of some real OU course population, retention or student intention data. If I get a chance this week, I'll create some 'plausible'  dummy data and try and post some example visualisations. But in the meantime, here is something a little more abstract... <br /><br />Consider some data that has the form:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095724908934670258"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rremzm4pJ7I/AAAAAAAAAZY/p3Y5Dh_g6o8/s800/manyeyestestdata1.png" /></a><br /><br />(In OU parlance, and in accord with my previous posts on this subject (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010472.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010499.html">here</a>) courses and modules might corrspond to courses and qualifications.)<br /><br />For each row, there are multiple columns. Numerical data in each column associates a row with a column, and also provides a notion of a 'weight' value between particular row and column values.<br /><br />This sort of layout is typical of many data sets, such as some of the <a href="http://www.ucas.com/figures/index.html">UCAS statistics data</a>. For example, here is some subject data from the <a href="http://www.ucas.com/figures/enq/index.html">UCAS statistics online interactive service</a>:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095718127181309842"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/Rrego24pJ5I/AAAAAAAAAY8/tAO73tnD1mE/s800/ucasData.png" /></a><br /><br />This information can be thought of as describing a weighted graph by viewing it as an <a href="http://oneweb.utc.edu/%7EChristopher-Mawata/petersen/lesson7.htm">adjacency matrix</a> - if the value of a cell is non-zero, imagine a connection between the row and column items:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095713918113359730"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/Rrecz24pJ3I/AAAAAAAAAYk/UCGInSUs3d8/s800/graphAdjancyMatrix.png" /></a><br /><br />Here, the 1s in the adjacency matrix represent a connection. In this case the graph is undirected (if node a is connected to node b, then node b is connected to node a) and the matrix is symmetrical.<br /><br />I had half-hoped that <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">Many Eyes</a> would be able to see the example data in the format described above as an adjacency matrix and plot the corresponding network diagram, but apparently not (at least, not at the moment...).<br /><br />Instead, the data needed transforming into a format that Many Eyes did like:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095710679708018466"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RreZ3W4pJyI/AAAAAAAAAX0/8dAO999Ww6w/s800/manyEyesTestdata2.png" /></a><br /> <br />The network visualisation tool then worked perfectly:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095720734226458530"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RrejAm4pJ6I/AAAAAAAAAZI/r-XiyLbIeF8/s800/manyeyesTestdataNetwork.png" /></a><br /><br />(See if you can reconcile this graph with the data in the original format ;-)<br /><br />With the data in this form, Many Eyes can now be used to create a wide variety of visualisations of the data.<br /><br />For example, here is a bubble matrix chart showing the numbers of people on 'courses' that are associated with particular 'modules':<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095713879458654002"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rrecxm4pJzI/AAAAAAAAAYE/at_i59CbUbs/s800/manyeyesTestdataMatrix.png" /></a><br /><br />The matrix chart also support a bar chart view - here, we can view the modules (represented via a percentage measure) against courses:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095713883753621314"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/Rrecx24pJ0I/AAAAAAAAAYM/75RvTexA95o/s800/manyeyesTestdataMatrixbar.png" /></a><br /><br />Pie charts are also readily visualised - here is the breakdown of courses:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095713896638523218"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/Rrecym4pJ1I/AAAAAAAAAYU/oKwNr1oUenc/s800/manyeyestestdataPie1.png" /></a><br /><br />And at the flick of a drop down list, a pie chart breakdown of the distribution by module:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095713905228457826"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RreczG4pJ2I/AAAAAAAAAYc/hXnDNYEqX2A/s800/manyeyesTestdataPie2.png" /></a><br /><br />You might also notice that a particular pie segments can be visually emphasised.<br /></p>

<p>Even before I read the related TechCrunch post today, I was thinking over breakfast about a possible blog post on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/05/microsoft-photosynth-covers-shuttle-endeavour-pre-launch/">3D worlds from photos</a> for the <a href="http://www.open2.net/blogs/scitechnature/index.php/">Open2.net <em>Science, technology &amp; Nature</em> blog</a>.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://fotowoosh.com/">Fotowoosh</a> (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPt7GmIpXo8">Fotowoosh on YouTube</a>) generate 3D models from a single image:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nPt7GmIpXo8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">PhotoSynth</a> creates 3D browsing from a collage of separate pictures (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g1kCNjAscc">Photosynth on YouTube</a>) :</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3g1kCNjAscc"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3g1kCNjAscc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/visualsize-to-give-accurate-3d-measurements-from-photos/">VisualSize</a> falls somewhere in between, offering the ability to make accurate measurements from two photographs of the same scene...</p>

<p>VisualSize in particular made me wonder - how long will it be before we get "binocular" cameras? Something the size of a Sony PSP, for example, with a camera lens at either end and a built in 3D viewer?</p>

<p>I was going to say 2008 for the early gadget adopters, with the first hints of volume in 2009 amongst users who photograph objects (buildings, and trains(?!) for example, rather than people/faces and scenery), depending on how things like Fotowoosh play out, but thought I'd better do a v quick search first...</p>

<p>Hmmm - <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=7402&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=3470">Kodak dual lens digital camera</a>, with "On-camera panorama stitch mode" (see the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/digital-cameras/ces-unveiled-kodak-dual+lens-digital-v570-146343.php">Gizmodo review</a>).</p>

<p>Those dates could be about right then?!</p>

<p>[For a Google Map showing the current (as of August 3, 2007) "foot and mouth exclusion zone", try here: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.edparsons.com%2FFoot_and_Mouth.kml&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11&om=1">Foot and Mouth Map, as of 3/8/07</a>.]</p>

<p>A comment on Ed Parson's <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=508">Foot and Mouth - a Geographical Problem</a> post suggests:<br />
<blockquote>The usefulness of the tool or otherwise comes from what analysis can be done with the output. Given that F&amp;M can often be distributed as an airborne disease, some means of showing the wind direction and speed over time makes this more than just a pretty coloured map...</blockquote><br />
I agree that it would be useful to be able to overlay wind speed and direction markers on to an emergency response map. And I wonder how difficult it would be to use such data to transform (even approximately) a circular overlay to one that reflects the likely distribution of a gas release, say, given prevailing wind conditions? </p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I can see a use for an "emergency response web 2.0" toolkit that would allow the rapid construction of an information website to aggregate information in the case of an emergency. A combination of something like <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> and <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/qedwiki/">IBM's QEDWiki</a> (which I really need to get round to playing with...!), maybe?</p>

<p>Anyway, as a stop gap on the weather thing, a quick search on Google MyMaps ("Add content") turns up this mapplet that can display the wind conditions from various locations around the world, including one not far from Guildford:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095168848108791554"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/tony.hirst/RrWtEm4pJwI/AAAAAAAAAXU/uFXwk3I4vfc/s800/gMapplet.png" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on the temperature marker opens up a pop-up that includes wind direction data:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5095162813679740658"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RrWnlW4pJvI/AAAAAAAAAXE/bJfPPlnmBaQ/s800/footMouthWeather.png" /></a></p>

<p>The Mapplet is provided by WeatherBug and can be found here: <a href="http://maps.google.com/ig/directory?url=http://mapplets.weatherbug.com/WeatherBugMapplet.xml">WeatherBug Mapplet</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that jumps out at me looking at that map - it would be sensible to make a semi-transparent coloured filter layer within the two circle overlays on the map.</p>

<p>I've not really looked at <a href=:http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a> yet, so maybe now's a good time for me to find out a little more about it, and try to add a semi-transparent layer in? ;-)</p>

<p>In several previous posts, I've looked at the way <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010329.html">timelines are being used to display search results</a>, <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010163.html">timeline and map combinations</a>, as well as demonstrating a <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010366.html">dual Google maps and timelines search page</a> (try out the side by side search view here: <a href="http://ouseful.googlepages.com/maptimeline.html">Google map and timeline results, side by side</a>):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5071196243881702098"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/tony.hirst/RmCCHY7dMtI/AAAAAAAAAC4/ouO-p2I-K18/s800/gMapnTimeline.png" /></a></p>

<p>Whilst I was searching for Google maps circle overlay scripts for the previous post on plotting <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010505.html">foot and mouth exclusion zones</a>, I came across this <s>post</s>paper on <a href="http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/07/16/Extending+Mashups+To+Visualize+Patterns+In+Temporal+Data.aspx">Extending Mashups to Visualize Patterns in Temporal Data</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Many datasets are now published as streams of time-stamped, geo-encoded events using GeoRSS. To understand patterns within this class of data, we have taken ideas from mashups and extended them to develop new visual components that present live geospatial data in novel ways. The components are interactive, live, linked and contain many novel features for understanding temporal and geospatial patterns in event data. The components are light-weight, thin client, Web 2.0 AJAX technology and are suitable for analyzing both on-line streaming and off-line static datasets. Our work expands traditional geospatial mashups to include timeline, time wheel, and graph mashups for real-time time streaming data.</blockquote></p>

<p>The paper describes several interesting ways of combining geo- and temportal data, and is well worth a read. Here's a second, related paper: <a href="http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/06/30/Thin+Client+Visualization.aspx">Extending Mashups to Visualize Patterns in Temporal Data</a>.</p>

<p>Quite by chance, my last feed reading session of the day turned up a post on <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com">SEO by the SEA</a> about <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=772">Google Timelines, Fact Maps, and Fact Relevance Rankings</a>:<br />
<blockquote>DISPLAYING FACTS ON A LINEAR GRAPH <br />
A set of objects having facts is established. Facts of objects having positions in a order are identified. Some facts explicitly describe the positions in the linear order, while are facts do not explicitly describe the positions. The facts are presented in the order on a linear graph, such as a timeline. Facts of the objects describing geographic positions are presented on a map.</blockquote><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&S1=20070179952.PGNR.&OS=dn/20070179952&RS=DN/20070179952"><small>United States Patent Application 20070179952</small></a></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out...</p>

<p>[For a Google Map showing the current (as of August 3, 2007) "foot and mouth exclusion zone", try here: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.edparsons.com%2FFoot_and_Mouth.kml&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11&om=1">Foot and Mouth Map, as of 3/8/07</a>.]</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago it was floods, and I put together a Google map mashup of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010494.html">clean water bowser locations in Gloucester</a>, and now it's a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/57bfbb8c-4208-11dc-8328-0000779fd2ac.html">foot and mouth alert</a> (UPDATE: <a href="http://microbiologybytes.wordpress.com/2007/08/04/uk-foot-and-mouth-disease-outbreak/">10 Facts About Foot and Mouth Disease</a>.)</p>

<p>I caught the news as I was driving home tonight, (I wasn't too far from the location of the outbreak at the time!) and when I heard a three kilometer <s>exclusion</s> protection zone and five kilometer surveillance zone had been imposed, my first thought was to wonder how easy it would be to plot some circular map overlays onto a Google map, a visualisation effect I originally saw demonstrated by Eric Meyer's <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/gmap/hydesim.html">HYDESim: High Yield Detonation Effects Simulator</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094628627122300610"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RrPBvm4pJsI/AAAAAAAAAWI/kO3YQ1rA_rA/s800/hydesim.png" /></a></p>

<p>Checking on the <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/default.htm"><em>defra</em> Foot and Mouth Disease</a> website, I found they'd already got an interactive map - of sorts - up already, although it's by no means as slick as a Google maps interface.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094624078751934114"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RrO9m24pJqI/AAAAAAAAAVw/aoMg7ZjQpoM/s800/footMouthMap1.png" /></a></p>

<p>For example, the map isn't draggable and the pan and zoom effects are quite coarse grained:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094624095931803314"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/tony.hirst/RrO9n24pJrI/AAAAAAAAAV4/SbxJxUgbFOI/s800/footMouthMap2.png" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6930684.stm">BBC News site</a> has gone for a static map:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094633420305802962"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RrPGGm4pJtI/AAAAAAAAAWY/_t1xNs_jE2Y/s800/footMouthBBCmap.png" /></a></p>

<p>(Interestingly, there was no information that I could find on the <a href="http://www.co-ordination.gov.uk/">UK Resilience</a> homepage, even though COBRA had been called. I'd have thought the two would be related, for some reason.)</p>

<p>It's a bit late now to start trying to put together a Google map equivalent of the above (in case it takes longer than I expect!) but as potential building blocks I found this site that uses calls on the Google maps API to plot a circle - <a href="http://maps.forum.nu/gm_clickable_circle.html">Google Maps clickable circle generator</a> - as well as a more general application for creating Google Map overlays - <a href="http://lecturer.eng.chula.ac.th/fsvskk/gglmap2/gmad-v2x.html">Google Maps-API Application for Digitizing (GMAD)</a>.</p>

<p>And here's a script that will <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">calculate the distance between two latitude/longitude points</a>.</p>

<p>If you come across a foot and mouth exclusion zone Google map, please send me the link :-)</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=508">Ed Parsons</a> has just posted a <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/Foot_and_Mouth.kml">KML file for the surveillance and protection zones</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094784800723117794"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tony.hirst/RrRPyG4pJuI/AAAAAAAAAWs/coOjZ_lGu2s/s800/footMouthKML.png" /></a></p>

<p>See it overlayed on a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwww.edparsons.com%2FFoot_and_Mouth.kml&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11&om=1">Google map</a>.</p>

<p>[UPDATE 17/7/07: There have a been a few earthquakes recently, and the mashups that have sprung up around them look like they may contain <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2007/08/earthquake-google-maps-mashup.html">some reusable circle overlay plotting tricks..?</a>]</p>

<p>PS How come I missed this - the Google maps polygon API; check out this example app: <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/01/gpolygon-example.html">GPolygon Example</a></p>

<p>Driving up to Milton Keynes today, I was listening to an <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1811.html">IT Conversations podcast from Where 2.0 about NASA Worldwind</a> that mentioned the <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA World Wind</a> app, a 3D globe that can be used to visualise Earth related data as well as the Moon, Mars, Venus and Jupiter.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206620815664690"><img src="http://lh6.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB7m4pJjI/AAAAAAAAAUo/HyztNsbMlKM/s800/worldwindLandsatGeoCover.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>As well as providing a 3D visualisation of the globe (along with 3D relief) World Wind provides overlays for many scientific visualisations, including animations.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206625110632002"><img src="http://lh3.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB724pJkI/AAAAAAAAAUw/oYq8XD6MPmU/s800/worldwindScienceViz.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>As mentioned, World Wind is not just about the Earth. Here's Mars:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206633700566610"><img src="http://lh5.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB8W4pJlI/AAAAAAAAAU4/OB_3U_pVECI/s800/worldwindMars.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Mars in relief (you only really get the feel for it when interacting with the globe):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206637995533922"><img src="http://lh6.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB8m4pJmI/AAAAAAAAAVA/tu_heu50vJk/s800/worldwindMars2.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Mars in colour relief:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206642290501234"><img src="http://lh3.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB824pJnI/AAAAAAAAAVI/bv3sHXBm1KA/s800/worldwindMarsColourRelief.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Also mentioned in the questions at the end of the podcast was <a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/">Celestia</a>, a "free space simulation that lets you explore our universe in three dimensions.... Unlike most planetarium software, Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of the Earth. You can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond the galaxy. "</p>

<p>But just for a taste, here's a view of part of our own solar system - Saturn:</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206646585468546"><img src="http://lh4.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB9G4pJoI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/UOaNMBvz-1Y/s800/celestiaSaturn.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>And something man-made - the Hubble Space Telescope (with constellations mapped out in the background).</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5094206650880435858"><img src="http://lh5.google.co.uk/tony.hirst/RrJB9W4pJpI/AAAAAAAAAVY/le2F7X-GsLs/s800/worldwindHubble.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I don't think OpenLearn has any astronomy units up yet, but a question occurs to me... How can we use OpenLearn to support learning around applications such as World Wind or Celestia, <em>if</em> there aren't any related OpenLearn units available?</p>

<p>I guess the only way at the moment is to upload the basics of a <em>new</em> unit to <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a>?</p>

<!--
<p>One of the key differentiators of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>, compared to other OER sites, is the provision of a "learning environment" around the open educational content. Several tools are provided to help learners make sense of the materials and also support community formation and social interactions.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/index.html">Compendium</a> visual thinking, knowledge mapping, sense making tool (which just doesn't make sense to me! Maybe I'm prejudiced against it because it requires a download...?;-):</p>

<p><img alt="compendium screenshot" src="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/osc/img/compendium/compendium_welcome.PNG" /></p>

<p><a href="http://flashmeeting.com">Flashmeeting</a>, a small group video conferencing tool, with and IM/chat line, whiteboard and the ability to record meetings and analyse participation within them:</p>

<p><img src="http://flashmeeting.open.ac.uk/images/screen01.jpg" alt="flashmeeting screenshot" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/msg/">MSG Instant Messenger</a>*, with it's nifty geo-presence indicator (I don't think you can make chat histories public, though, in a "previous chats about this topic" sort of way?):</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.hirst/OUsefulScreenshots/photo#5093658355355428050"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/tony.hirst/RrBPSW4pJNI/AAAAAAAAARI/Yw_jP6l5enA/s800/kmiMSG.png" /></a><br />
<small>(MSG is an open source software app, I think, that runs using Jabber?)</small></p>

<p> and the OpenLearn forums...</p>

<p>...which <a href="http://openlearn.blogspot.com/2007/06/forum-discussion.html">don't seem to be working at all well...</a>:<br />
<blockquote>We are having a problem in that the number of people who are using the OpenLearn forums and making postings is rather limited. It is felt that the reasons for this may be:</p>

<p>    * there are too many forums <small>[OUseful: YES - and this potentially silos discussions. For example, several units cover overlapping areas (climate change and global warming come to mind, elements of ICT systems do too). One thing discussion is good for is considering multiple points of view; the current forum structure fragments discussion even about the same topic.]</small></p>

<p>    * the forums are often too deeply embedded <small>[OUseful: YES - and where they appear moves around: on the front page, there's a link in the left sidebar, on the unit pages it's in the right; I guess the forum box is always below the scroll, though, which is some sort of consistency!]</small></p>

<p>    * people may not be encouraged to enter the forum <small>[OUseful: YES - but what do you expect? No-one likes to be first to post - many sites seed their forums to give the appearance of activity, like seating diners in the window of a restaurant...]</small></blockquote></p>

<p>And of course, it'd take at least 3 clicks? maybe 4? from the front page before you can even see evidence of a forum posting?</p>

<p>What brought OpenLearn comms to mind was a recent TechCrunch post on <a href="http://www.tangler.com/">Tangler</a> (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/31/tanglers-embedded-discussions/">Tangler's Embedded Discussions</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Australian startup Tangler has created a next generation forum product that allows real-time discussions to occur without page refreshes. Their forum product is both synchronous and asynchronous - meaning it competes as much with Meebo (web based chat) as it does with existing forum applications.</blockquote></p>

<p>Whether or not this is what Tangler does, reconciling "public" chat (i.e. supporting chat rooms as well as p2p chat), "public" Flashmeetings and forum discussions maybe one way of fostering and cross-promoting the OpenLearn communications channels?</p>

<p>At the moment, I'd have to look in several places for discussion about an OpenLearn topic (<em>if</em> such a discussion exists...): the Compendium archive, the Flashmeeting archive and the forums. And maybe a Facebook group.... etc etc.</p>

<p>Maybe finding a way of using forums as a conversation aggregator about a particular topic would be a better way to go?</p>
