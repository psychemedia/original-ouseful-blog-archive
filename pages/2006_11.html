<!--
<p>The <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/">Digilab</a>  - a playspace for new technologies  - opened in the Library a couple of days ago:</p>

<blockquote>DigiLab is a showcase for tools, technologies and resources illustrating how today's technology can nurture tomorrow's learners. The long term aim will be to provide visitors with guides explaining how engaging interactive materials achieve successful learning outcomes. It is hoped that exploration of DigiLab will spark the creativity of the multi-disciplinary teams who develop our learning materials</blockquote>

<p>As well as the room itself, DigiLab is also sponsoring the <a href="http://digilab.open.ac.uk/services/loanout.php">loan of Gameboys, PSPs, iPods etc etc</a> from the library loans desk. (In fact, borrowing some of these items has been possible for a year or so now - I remember taking an OU Library iPod away for Christmas, and a PSP out a few weeks later.)</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007UATDG?ie=UTF8&tag=robofestauk-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0007UATDG">Nintendo Wii Console</a> is apparently on order... I think it'd be good if they got a Nabaztag WiFi Rabbit too: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FDEC0G?ie=UTF8&tag=robofestauk-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B000FDEC0G"><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000FDEC0G.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_V34649888_.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=robofestauk-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000FDEC0G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>DigiLab bookmarks are being collected on a delicious account with username <a href="http://del.icio.us/digilab">digilab</a>; there's also a DigiLabrarian avatar in Second Life - <em>Kayla Vielle</em> - and a Second Life avatar DigiLab patrons can 'borrow' - <em>Digi May</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, now the room is open to all, I've started wondering about what sorts of thing it would be good to do in there, and how we might be able to use the room to get an <em>ad hoc</em> viral buzz going about different technologies.</p>

<p>Here's one possible format, inspired by an excellent link that I was sent a day or two ago (from someone who doesn't blog yet (...)) to a video that demonstrates the use of a beautiful tool for animating UN socio-economic data (?):</p>

<p><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=2670820702819322251#3m24s&hl=en-GB" flashvars=""> </embed></p>

<p>(If your feedreader can't cope with embedded Google Video, check here: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2670820702819322251#3m24s">Ideas Worth Spreading: Hans Rosling from TED 2006</a>.)</p>

<p>When I saw this movie, I thought it was just the sort of thing to summon the troops around and watch over a coffee, followed by a bit of a play: <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder">http://tools.google.com/gapminder</a> (interesting URL, I thought...?). You can also find more info at <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly the lack of a coffee machine in the DigiLab makes coffee a little tricky right now, but apparently it's on the cards :-)</p>

<p>PS At the DigiLab launch, PVC (Learning and Teaching) let it be known that he was getting a fund together to support something along the lines of beta.open.ac.uk (or labs.open.ac.uk) which could be used to try out experimental presentation models. If I get more concrete details, I'll post them either here or on my little used Nous internal blog. If any internal readers have more info about this, please add a comment... If anyone is interested in making a pitch using tools or techniques mentioned in the OUseful blog, mail me...</p>

<!--
<p>Several bloggers <a href="http://www.researchbuzz.org/wp/2006/11/20/service-for-publishing-cyclic-rss-feeds/">picked up</a> today on <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/">FeedCycle</a>, a new web application for managing serialised RSS feeds:<br />
<blockquote>A serialised RSS web feed enables a subscriber to receive, perhaps on a daily basis, sequential episodes from within a series of episodes. The subscriber always starts at the beginning regardless when they start their subscription.</blockquote><br />
I've been waiting for something like this to appear for some time (e.g. see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/004775.html">Paced Content Delivery via RSS</a> (from just over a year ago?!?!? Where's the time gone?!) and <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=paced%20content&IncludeBlogs=1149">a few other related items</a>) so it was exciting to see how the (UK-based) developers have gone about it.</p>

<p>(The feed you subscribe to has a timestamp argument - now why didn't I think of that? Producing my own scheduled feeds via a simple feed relay that takes an original subscription timestamp and desired duty cycle should only take a handful of lines of PHP....)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway - having already got a web feed creation route set up (after a fashion) for OpenLearn/LabSpace content, I couldn't wait to try out <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/">FeedCycle</a>. Free (limited) accounts are available so I set one up to use the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">T180 Living with the internet: keeping it safe</a>  content.</p>

<p>At the moment, getting content into FeedCycle seems a bit clunky. I would have like to import my own RSS feed, but instead I had to copy and paste items one at a time into the FeedCycle editor.</p>

<p><img alt="feedcycle.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedcycle.jpg" width="513" height="513" border="0" /></p>

<p>Pasting HTM L directly is perfectly acceptable - FeedCycle automatically wraps the content in CDATA tags. It's also possible to add a media enclosure to a feed item (so I added in a couple of related presentations from <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>).</p>

<p>Once you've got the content in, the ability to reorder items is quite useful:</p>

<p><img alt="feedcycle1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedcycle1.jpg" width="485" height="485" border="0" /></p>

<p>The frequency with which feed items are published can be set from 1 hour to about 30 days. It would be handy if this could be handled via another URL argument. I originally started out testing the feed with an hourly publishing rate, but  for the link below it's set at one item per day. It's not possible (at the moment) to generate URLs for the same cyclic feed with different delivery/publication rates, nor is it possible to copy a whole feed and use it as the basis for another (e.g. with just a different publication rate).</p>

<p><img alt="feedCycle2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/feedCycle2.jpg" width="943" height="457" border="0" /></p>

<p>Delivering training materials via FeedCyle is one of the <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/ideas.php">suggested</a> commercial applications. However, I think there is great potential for publishing OpenLearn content in this way.</p>

<p>The OpenLearn material is already chunked into short sections, ideal for consuming via a feed on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Just like 'tip of the day', materials can be delivered one small chunk at a time once per day to the informal learner's feed reader. For learners who can get into the habit of looking at the feed once every day or two, the course material will be delivered in a sensibly paced way, and will not overload the learner in advance. </p>

<p>There are issues in not being able to get ahead, of course. But there are a couple of workarounds: one is to <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?view=3p&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">look at the whole course feed</a>; another is to resubscribe to the feed with a backdated timestamp (it would be easy enough to build a  tool to support this). It would be neat if FeedCycle could support a 'send me the next item now' service - maybe that's on the cards?</p>

<p>Anyway - I know you're itching to try it out ;-) so here's the T180 <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1664">Living With the Internet: Keeping It Safe</a> block as a paced feed (items delivered according to a daily schedule). If you're reading this via a feed reader, you'll probably need to click through to the actual blog page because the timestamped feed subscription link is generated via a Javascript include:</p>

<p>Here's the paced feed link - <script type="text/javascript" src="http://feeds.feedcycle.com/chicklet.php?type=1&amp;url=10053/10093/31fc36f3&amp;message=OpenLearn%20Daily%20-%20Living%20With%20the%20Internet%3A%20Keeping%20It%20Safe%20%2814%20day%20feed%29"></script></p>

<p>Once subscribed, you'll get one section/item per day in your feedreader for the next fortnight.</p>

<p>If you give it a go and have either success in consuming the feed, or grief consuming it, please let me know...</p>

<p>And if anyone out there is interested in developing this a bit further, maybe helping tighten up the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/openlearn2rss.xsl">OpenLearn/LabSpace XML2RSS stylesheet</a> (or markup generated by it), working on automation routes for mining LabSpace ;-), developing a custom, lightweight FeedCycle inspired script suited to educational use, or generally helping to create a daily learning chunks platform to help push LabSpace sourced content (maybe remixed with other <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/ocw">OCW</a> content), please get in touch.... :-)</p>

<!--
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've played with - and reviewed - several different styles of online course. Some have been based around Flash presentations (animated slideshows with an audio track essentially); some have been lists of links to PDFs; some have been HTML content.  Most have been delivered via some sort of website and viewed using a web browser.</p>

<p>A couple of approaches I'm interested in exploring relate to the delivery of course material through other means - online using web feeds (such as RSS); offline using portable devices, such as USB memory sticks. I'll post about RSS/web feed delivery and Portable Study Sticks in the next week or two, but here are some thoughts about some of the current issues (as I see them) relating to some of the ways I believe we currently deliver electronic course materials and electronic copies of printed course materials.</p>

<p>At the current time, student access to OU online course materials tends to be cut-off a few short weeks after the end of the course. Students can, of course, save their own copies of each course page (e.g. see the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008414.html">hints on how to do this relatively easily</a> using the <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/">Scrapbook</a> browser extension). I am unclear as to <em>why</em> physical/offline copies of courses are <em>not</em> provided as a matter of course at them moment - maybe it's a rights thing?</p>

<p>There have been one or two exceptions. A couple of Relevant Knowledge short courses (which combine HTML teaching materials and PDF practical guides) have been delivered on the relevant course CD-ROM and at least one other course with a large online/HTML course material component was made available as compressed HTML (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Compressed_HTML_Help">chm format</a>).</p>

<p>But as far as I know, providing a convenient downloadable version of our online courses has not been the norm. That said, some of these courses are becoming available now via <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> (although it's interesting to note that - along with <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">LabSpace</a> - OpenLearn doesn't make easily usable, exportable/downloadable <em>offline</em> versions of the material available, although you can get an XML version of each course from the LabSpace site)).</p>

<p>One possible argument for not distributing HTML course materials is the fear that copies will get out into the wild and become obtainable outside the course registration (and payment ;-) loop? Another possibility is the well made one that online course materials can rot quite badly, and may as a result reduce the perceived quality of unsupported HTML materials (where the expectation may still be that th elinks will work). This is  particularly true in respect of deep links (which we are not allowed to use, of course ;-) Or the allowable use of top/domain-level links with instructions on how to get to the deep page you want the student to visit (go to URL x, take the third link on the right, enter y in the search box and follow the link to z which was the third result when I tried...;-)</p>

<p>The availability of electronic course materials presenting a threat to the sale of courses is worth considering in a little more detail ("are we giving away our crown jewels?") and comparing with the situation that arises in the case of <em>print</em> materials...</p>

<p>...because it's worth reminding ourselves that copies of OU materials can be found in many reference libraries, as well as OU Study Centres; (and how about <a href="http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/">University Book Search</a>, the third party OU second-hand course material website?)</p>

<p>The differences between the lifetime and cost of duplication of print materials compared to electronic materials is often brought out at this point - it's easy to pass on a copy of an electronic document, but harder to do the same for a physical one. But the availability of digital scanners with OCR capabilities means that the cost can be reduced, particularly if a community works together to scan a particular publication.... </p>

<p>There is an interesting aside I would like to make here. One course I know of made use of a third party book that suffered from accessibility issues in terms of layout and typography that typically made it difficult to read by one or two students on each presentation of the course. In one presentation, the story goes that the students gathered together and retyped the whole book for the needy student(s) and presented it in a series of installments as accessible PDF. A flagrant breach of copyright, maybe, but a fine demonstration of a community working together to serve one of its less fortunate members ;-)</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of stories, rumour also has it that talks are afoot about whether or not the OU should get involved with one of the online booksearch projects (such as <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> or the <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/">Open Content Alliance</a>) in getting OU legacy content scanned and made searchable. If this were to happen, then print materials would be available in <em>two</em> electronic formats (many of the OU's printed course materials are <em>already</em> made available to students in ebook/pdf format).</p>

<p>It is worth noting at this point that (as far as I know, and at least until a month or two ago, so I have been told) the course material ebooks are not currently available as a matter of course for preview/browsing by current OU students. In particular, requests from students for electronic copies of course materials from courses they are considering taking cannot - apparently - be satisfied. This reticence presumably follows from the assumption that if the materials are available, students won't study the course.</p>

<p>[Note to self - check this is still the case, e.g. by checking the Library catalogue and VLE for electronic versions of electronic OU Study Guides and course units).]</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the point: the fear that making content freely available would reduce the number of people registering for our courses was one of the concerns raised regarding the release of materials on OpenLearn under a Creative Commons license; but the OpenLearn considerations is actually different in kind. Firstly, because only a very small fraction of OU materials are being released to OpenLearn; and secondly, many of the materials being released are taken from courses that are no longer in presentation.</p>

<p>Even so, the argument that the access to materials if they are made available in electronic form will reduce the likelihood that people will <em>buy</em> the course those materials are provided in is not a strong one. Firstly, the OU is not just a content producer. The course package is an altogether different proposition, including as it does software packages, tutor support and face-to-face tutorials, moderated, course specific online communities, assessment, formal educational credit, and so on, all value adding services delivered in addition to the actual course materials. Secondly, 'free access to materials' is a loaded phrase. More accurate in this case would be 'the ability to preview course materials'.</p>

<p>That print course materials are made available in electronic form (which support search using desktop search tools, for example) whilst access to pure electronic content after the end of the course is not guaranteed seems a bit odd to me. If I take a traditional course, I leave with physical and electronic copies of the course materials. If I take an electronic course, I leave with nothing that I don;t copy myself. (Related to this are the lack of course related derivative products, such as <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008559.html">course related link collections and search engines</a>.)</p>

<p>Hmm.. one for the Library, I think... preview copies through the library catalogue of all course units, at least for users (students and/or staff) with a SAMS cookie set (i.e. OU authenticated users).</p>

<p>Over the last few week, <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and <a href="http://pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a> have both gone up a version and <a href="http://excite.co.uk">Excite.co.uk</a> has released its own <a href="http://mix.excite.co.uk/">Excite webtop/startpage</a> as a beta ("European grown all the way!!" apparently - which seems to be the way of a lot of this display surfaces?). Paying a visit today to Pageflakes and Nettvibes (seeing how they handle a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">course content feed</a> derived from an <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn LabSpace</a> course) a couple of new (to me at least) features caught my eye.</p>

<p>Firstly, Netvibes has a search filter that is applied over the feeds coming into a tab (the search is over link text and item description text, I think?):</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesFilter1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesFilter1.jpg" width="657" height="245" border="0" /></p>

<p>The filter also highlights the search/filter terms in the feed item description:</p>

<p><img alt="netvibesFilter2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/netvibesFilter2.jpg" width="669" height="366" border="0" /></p>

<p>In Pageflakes, there is the option of opening links (fin the example I'm using, from a delicious RSS feed) in a floating, pop-up browser within the Pageflakes environment:</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOpenLinks1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOpenLinks1.jpg" width="292" height="233" border="0" /></p>

<p>I like the feel of this interaction - it's reminiscent of the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/007632.html">"Now follow this link" lightbox</a> pattern I doodled with a month or two ago.</p>

<p>Ideally, though, this pop-up embedded/floating browser requires a large screen resolution to allow the pop-up window to render the linked to page sensibly, yet still retain the Pageflakes context:</p>

<p><img alt="pageflakesOpenLinks2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/pageflakesOpenLinks2.jpg" width="720" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you don't use either of these applications regularly, or you use one and not the other, it's worth popping back every so often, I think, to see what new innovations they have come up.</p>

<p>And finally, just to recap on how these services display the OpenLearn course content feed, here are a couple of screenshots. </p>

<p>First, Pageflakes:</p>

<p><img alt="ccFeedPageflakes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ccFeedPageflakes.jpg" width="809" height="453" border="0" /></p>

<p>And here's the same feed in Netvibes:</p>

<p><img alt="ccFeedNetvibes.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ccFeedNetvibes.jpg" width="617" height="451" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to try out the feed, here are a couple of links:</p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">Sample OpenLearn Course Content Feed</a> <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/subscribe.aspx?url=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml"><img alt="RSS Feed - Pageflakes" src="http://www.pageflakes.com/subscribe2.gif" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/subscribe.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fouseful.open.ac.uk%2Fopenlearnplayground%2FT180_8_rss.xml"><img src="http://www.netvibes.com/img/add2netvibes.gif" width="91" height="17" alt="Add to Netvibes" /></a> <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml"><img src="http://www.bloglines.com/images/sub_modern9.gif" alt="Subscribe with Bloglines" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p>It's also worth checking out the feed directly in Firefox and IE7...</p>

<p>I had a tinker with <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a> over the weekend to fix badly broken styling in IE and add support for user configuration of the toolbar and stylesheet. As I was doing so it struck me that most of the tools I have in the default setup are <em>social</em> tools.</p>

<p>For example, the StringLE default setup links to a chatroom, whiteboard and Flashmeeting, which are best suited to synchronous interaction with other people.</p>

<p>(Remember - tools appear in the Tools tab.)</p>

<p>Several other tools, whilst personally useful, also have a social dimension, in that they support (asynchronous) collaborative working (that is, document editing can be shared with others): the wiki, drawing tool and social' document editor, for example.</p>

<p>The 'personal' tools include the <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> search engine intermediary service and links to a webtop, map generator and online video editor. Even then, the map is intended for sharing and searchfeedr can display other users' saved searches, as well as allowing you to search over other people's saved links.</p>

<p>Coming as I do from the <em>how might we use "web 2.0" toys to support user created personal learning envrionments?</em> position, it strikes me that just as many <em>social</em> tools are personally useful, <em>personal</em> learning environments can (should?) draw on a wide number of <em>socially</em> useful tools?</p>

<p>It may even be that collaborative group work using online tools is one way of driving individual students towards their personal use of online tools <em>if that's what we want to encourage?</em></p>

<p>Anyway - back to <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a>. You can now customise any or all of the following URLs via the StrinGLE URL:</p>

<p>* the navigation OPML file,<br />
* the toolbar feed,<br />
* the 'splash' HTML page (that is, the page that loads in the Web tab when you first load StringLE),<br />
* a CSS stylesheet and<br />
* an included Javascript file (the Widget panel).</p>

<p>The toolbar feed is a delicious feed from a specified delicious user (or user/tag) combination. Links that are tagged with <em>stringle:tool</em> are pulled into the toolbar. For example, <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/officeDemo&s=http://www.open2.net">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?t=psychemedia/officeDemo&s=http://www.open2.net</a> pulls in links from <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/officeDemo">http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/officeDemo</a> that are also tagged with <em>stringle:tool</em>. An additional tag can be used to define the label used as the link text for the link. In the example given, <em>stringle:WordProcessor</em> sets the link text as <em>WordProcessor</em>. The above URL also sets the splash screen to <a href="http://open2.net">Open2.net</a>.</p>

<p>All but the Widget panel feed can be configured from the StringLE configuration panel:</p>

<p><img alt="stringleNewconfig.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringleNewconfig.jpg" width="174" height="230" border="0" /></p>

<p>Hitting the <em>Set URL</em> button loads StringLE with the new configuration.</p>

<p>The configuration is also bookmarkable from the <em>Link to this page</em> link.</p>

<p>Full details <a href="http://stringle.pbwiki.com/StringLE%20URL%20API">here</a>.</p>

<p>(I am going to start documenting StringLE on the <a href="http://stringle.pbwiki.com">StringLE wiki</a> and post about it less here. To keep up, you may want to subscribe to the <a href="http://stringle.pbwiki.com/atom.php">StringLE wiki changes feed</a>.)</p>

<h3 class="title">Collecting Third Party Website Statistics (like Yahoo's) with Google Analytics</h3>

<!--
<p>Did you know you can collect web stats for any site - not just sites you 'own' - using <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>? Well with a little bit of Greasemonkey magic (or a suitable browser extension) it seems you can.</p>

<p>Idly wondering whether I could set up my own shadow research project to study OpenLearn user behaviour, I knocked up a very simple Greasemonkey script to add a Google Analytics tracking script onto the bottom of any OpenLearn pages I visited:<br />
<blockquote>// ==UserScript==<br />
// @name           Openlearn tracker<br />
// @namespace      http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog<br />
// @description    Adds tracking to openlearn pages<br />
// @include        http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/*</p>

<p>// ==/UserScript==</p>

<p>(function() {</p>

<p> var b=document.getElementsByTagName('body');<br />
 var s=document.createElement('script');<br />
 s.setAttribute('src','');<br />
 s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');<br />
 b[0].appendChild(s);<br />
 s=document.createElement('script');<br />
 s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');<br />
 var t=document.createTextNode('_uacct = "UA-******-*";');<br />
 s.appendChild(t);<br />
 b[0].appendChild(s);<br />
})();</blockquote></p>

<p>It's easy enough to put this script into an extension format - for example using a Greasemonkey compiler.</p>

<p>Setting up the tracking on Google Analytics was easy enough too:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics1.jpg" width="485" height="145" border="0" /></p>

<p>... as you can see:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics2.jpg" width="480" height="83" border="0" /></p>

<p>For example, the first few stats:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics3.jpg" width="715" height="480" border="0" /></p>

<p>I did wonder whether I was getting away with this almost legitimately because I have properly installed tracking on the OUseful blog, which lives on the <em>open.ac.uk</em> domain.</p>

<p>So I tried on a domain I have absolutely no formal relationship with (except for a handful of search API developer tokens!)  - Yahoo.</p>

<p>A very minor tweak to the Greasemonkey script allows the Google tracking script to be added to the bottom of any page on the yahoo.com domain:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics9.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics9.jpg" width="479" height="193" border="0" /></p>

<p>Setting up the Google Analytics account - and obtaining a tracking code - is easy enough:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics4.jpg" width="489" height="139" border="0" /></p>

<p>And as you can see, tracking is working:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics5.jpg" width="481" height="63" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here are some results:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics6.jpg" width="511" height="381" border="0" /></p>

<p>You can see from the results above - and the header below - how the Google tracker script even manages to capture dynamic (search query) content:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics7.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics7.jpg" width="352" height="190" border="0" /></p>

<p>[The search queries in the graphical view over multiple sites (<em>p=plone+(site:www...</em> etc.) are actually generated using the <a href="http://searchfeedr.com">searchfeedr</a> search intermediary, which is rapidly becoming my search interface of choice.]</p>

<p>What this means - among other things - is that if I can get you to install my extension, I can track your behaviour over my competitors' websites.</p>

<p>I can't really understand why Google Analytics doesn't at least check that you have installed the script on at least one particular page on the domain being tracked and which Google can poll when it feels like to check that the tracking is still officially sanctioned. I wonder if this is mentioned at all in the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470053852?tag=robofestauk-21">Google Analytics book</a>?</p>

<p>Because it seems to me that there is no such check.</p>

<p>Now it may well be that I am in breach of Google Analytics Terms and Conditions, but people will play...</p>

<p>Just a couple of other things to note in passing - when the Google tracker script fires, it also seems to tell Google blogsearch what's going on:</p>

<p><img alt="googleAnalytics8.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/googleAnalytics8.jpg" width="225" height="188" border="0" /></p>

<p>And for OU internal readers, you can see a glimpse of the sorts of results that the <a href="http://www.site-intelligence.co.uk/">Site Intelligence</a> <a href="http://www.netliancecorp.com/webanalytics.html">VBIS</a>  web analytics package gives for OpenLearn visitors <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/open-content/p7.shtml">here</a>.

<!--
<p>A couple of people have got in touch recently about the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/edit/mt-search.cgi?search=traveller&IncludeBlogs=1149">OU Library Traveller Scripts</a> that pop up library info panels on Amazon et al. book pages (I'll mail you soon - I promise...;-) and it prompted me to dust off a script I started to doodle with a bit ago to deal with the multiple ISBN problem...</p>

<p>...you know the one - where the book you're looking at on Amazon is held by the library, but in a different format or edition, and hence under a different ISBN, which is used to key the script.</p>

<p>Jon Udell posted a Greasemonkey script that will <A href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/01/30.html">search the catalogue using xISBNs</a> - that is, equivalent ISBN numbers for a particular book identified via OCLC's <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/xisbn/">xISBN</a> service (he could also have used the <a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/2006/06/thingisbn-librarythings-first-api.php">LibraryThing ThingISBN service</a>).</p>

<p>But that's all a bit too much like hard work for lazy old me... </p>

<p>Now, AI is (or used to be) my background, and in AI we use all sorts of heuristics (rules of thumb) and shortcuts for getting things to work, and sometimes they even work to a "good enough" QoS level;-) I haven't started on an AI solution yet (! - and don't intend to...;-), but here's a crude heuristic - <em>if the library holds the book under a different ISBN, maybe it'll find it if I search by title?</em></p>

<p>The OU Traveller scripts are intended to work on sites wherever there is an ISBN in the URL, so scraping the title off an arbitrary site is hard. That's not a problem, though, because we can use an Amazon web service to look up the title of a book from its ISBN, which is what the new script does.</p>

<p>If a book can't be found in your library catalogue using the ISBN, the script then offers to do a title (or author) search. (The next time I revisit this script I will build the title lookup to run automatically and report holding status back via the Traveller panel):</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerTitle1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerTitle1.jpg" width="663" height="283" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the appropriate link then runs the relevant search on the library catalogue:</p>

<p><img alt="ouTravellerTtile2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ouTravellerTtile2.jpg" width="502" height="180" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you want to give the script a run on your own catalogue, the ISBN lookup will worth with very minor modifications (see <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008008.html">Generic Library Traveller</a> for more info) but you will need to dig around in the script  - and play with URLs from your own library catalogue - to work out the title or author lookup. Mail me if you do this and we can collect customisations on a wiki somewhere.</p>

<p>Maybe, if there is enough (any?!) interest, I'll look at ways of making the title lookup generic for different vendor catalogues on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Anyway - enough of that: the script is here: <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/genericTravellerAlphaTitleLookup.user.js">Generic Library Traveller with OU Book Title lookup</a>.</p>

<p>There are potential conflicts with previous installations/versions of the Library Traveller scripts, so you may have to pay a visit to the Greasemonkey control panel in your browser to disable previous versions.</p>

<p>If you are trusting of compiled Greasemonkey scripts (that is, Firefox extensions generated from Greasemonkey scripts), and/or would rather not install Greasemonkey, feel free to create your own extension from the script (e.g. using the <a href="http://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler">Arantius Greasemonkey compiler</a>).</p>

<p>I do not accept any liability whatsoever if anything goes wrong, of course ;-)</p>

<!--
<p>A couple of people have asked over the last week or two whether I knew of an online OPML manager that could be used to create and organise hosted OPML feeds that could then be wired directly into <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a>.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a play over the weekend, and again today over lunch, and from the <a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/opml+manager">list of OPML managers</a> I've collected, <a href="http://opmlmanager.com">OPML Manager</a> seems to fit the bill nicely.</p>

<p>So nicely, in fact, I'm using it to feed the default Stringle environment:</p>

<p><img alt="stringleOPMLManager.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringleOPMLManager.jpg" width="672" height="494" border="0" /></p>

<p>What this means is I now have a completely online solution for handling what gets fed into the Stringle navigation panel (remember, you can enter your own URL for the OPML feed using the customisation panel or the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008357.html">StringLE URL API</a>).</p>

<p>I've added a link to OPML Manager from the top bar of StringLE. These tool links open in the Tools tab/panel (links from the Grazr navigation widget on the left hand side open in the Web panel).</p>

<p>You'll notice that the <a href="http://grazr.com">Grazr</a> widget is now displaying a couple of OPML files (the blue feed icon). These are fed into Grazr as links - Grazr sniffs out the opml suffix and then handles them as you might expect it to...</p>

<p>I'm actually use these OPML files to pull in GrazrScripted search boxes - one for the OU Voyager library catalogue, one for Amazon (read more about <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon in Grazr</a>).</p>

<p>The Learning Materials section pulls in <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn/Labspace</a> content that I <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008208.html">transformed to RSS</a>, both directly and in a crude 'remix'  - feeds generated from two Openlearn courses and piped through <a href="http://feeddigest.com/">FeedDigest</a>, along with a podcast feed, filtered using a couple of keywords, and then displayed in another Grazr widget (I'll pop a diagram up to show how it works in a couple of days...;-)</p>

<p>One thing I noticed doing this is that Grazr is capable of playing audio files embedded in a feed - there are some examples in the Learning materials section under 'Search Related IT Conversations' and here:</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03"></script>
</div>

<p>Apparently, embedded movies are also on the way...</p>

<p>If you try out StringLE, why not pop in to the chat room to see if anyone else is there. There is also a wiki that I'm going to start adding content to, too, but feel free to chip in (anonymous access is allowed but you need the password: <em>StringLE</em>).</p>

<p>If anyone wants an invite to the demo whiteboard or Elgg space, mail me... or leave a note in the wiki (create an <em>Invites...</em> page if there isn't one there already...)</p>

<!--
<p>I've been playing with Grazr quite a bit lately (doodling with an <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon Grazr search widget</a>, for example, as well as <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StringLE</a>) and here are three distinct ways I've found of using it:<br />
<ol><li>for navigation - links can be fed into a Grazr sidebar widget configured to open clicked links in a named frame (typically a large central panel), using a <em>linktarget</em> argument in the Grazr URL; the script at <em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php</em> takes two arguments - <em>s=</em> sets the URL for the 'splash' page that is displayed in the central panel when the page loads; the <em>u=</em> argument is the URL for the feed that is loaded into the Grazr widget; <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php?s=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr&u=http://del.icio.us/rss/psychemedia/opml">Grazr <em>navigation</em> example</a>;</li><br />
<li>reading content - a Grazr widget can be used as a feed reader; just pass the Grazr widget the URL of the feed you want to read; <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?font=arial&fontsize=9pt&view=3p&file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/T180_8_rss.xml">Grazr <em>feedreading</em> exmple</a>;</li><br />
<li>as a (search) widget - the introduction of GrazrScript means that Grazr can make use of form elements to create customised, feed generating URLs; for search engines and catalogues that <a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazon.opml">Grazr <em>form based (search) widget</em> example</a> (Amazon search); it is also possible to create a search engine widget if you can get search results into an RSS format, like this <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrNav.php?u=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrGoogleOPML.php">Google search Grazr widget</a>;</li></ol></p>

<p>Another three faces of Grazr are the three views it supports: slider view, outline view and three pane view. I also just noticed there's a built in audio player, so for podcast feeds that have an audio file attachment, you can listen to the podcast directly within Grazr... :-)</p>

<p>Try this, for example - I started pulling together a collection of audio files in the <a href="http://podchains.net/">Podchains</a> podcast playlist builder. Using Grazr, I now have a really handy way of playing the files contained in my <a href="http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03">podchains OUseful Audio feed</a> - try it out here: <a href="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://podchains.net/feed.php?id=abbd9f90565ce9ae4d065d93a81d8c03">Grazr does audio...</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like StringLE will now be able to do audio ;-)</p>

<p>PS I just added this as a PS to the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008496.html">Amazon Grazr widget post</a>, but I know how rarely I read reposts, so I'm going to post it here too:</p>

<p>Here's a quick way of customising a Grazr/Amazon search widget to let you 'hardwire' the locale and product type for the search. There are two buttons in the form  - one uses Javascript, the other doesn't:<br />
<script type="text/javascript">function createGrazr(){var countryNode=document.getElementById("country");var country=countryNode.options[countryNode.selectedIndex].value;var searchtypeNode=document.getElementById("searchtype");var searchtype=searchtypeNode.options[searchtypeNode.selectedIndex].value;window.location="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonOPML.php?country="+country+"&searchtype="+searchtype;}</script><form name="amznform" action="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonRedirect.php" method="GET">Amazon Search:<br />
Locale: <select name="country" id="country"><option value="uk">Amazon.co.uk</option><option value="ca">Amazon.ca</option><option value="us">Amazon.com</option><option value="de">Amazon.de</option><option value="jp">Amazon.jp</option><option value="fr">Amazon.fr</option></select><br />
Shop: <select name="searchtype" id="searchtype"><option value="Books">Books</option><option value="Classical">Classical Music</option><option value="DVD">DVD</option><option value="Electronics">Electronics</option><option value="Software">Software</option><option value="Music">Music</option><option value="SoftwareVideoGames">Software &amp; Games</option><option value="Toys">Toys &amp; Games</option></select><br />
Javascript: <input type="button" value="Grazr It!" onclick="createGrazr()" /><br />
Form Action: <input type="submit" value="Grazr It!" /></form></p>

<p>If the form doesn't appear in you feedreader, you can find one here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonConfig.html">Amazon/Grazr search widget customiser</a></p>

<!--
<p>At the request of the TU120 Course Team, I spent half an hour a couple of days ago extracting <em>by hand</em> the external links from the online course materials for the first week of <a href="http://ousefu;l.open.ac.uk/tu120">Beyond Google</a>  and popping them into <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious</a>.</p>

<p>Although the materials are generated from XML source files (and so automated link extraction is trivial) I did it by hand partly to see what observations I could make about what sorts of information might be available to support the automated tagging and description of automatically extracted links.</p>

<p>A secondary aim was to see what thoughts occurred to me regarding the potential reuse of linkrolls/link collections, and the extent to which we could:</p>

<p>a)  provide linkrolls as part of an added value "product" to students;<br />
b) exploit linkrolls within a course as an additional navigation aid (for revision, or catchup);<br />
c) use linkrolls as a feed source for a course related customised search engine.</p>

<p>Anyway - here are the <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1">TU120 Week 1 links</a>, and here are a few things that came to mind as I was bookmarking them:</p>

<p>1) <em>Tagging is an issue:</em>: there are various sorts of tags we can use to mark up these external links:</p>

<p>I focussed <em>just</em> on organisational/course administration links for this exercise, using:</p>

<p>- section and subsection numbers (<a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1">1</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1.1">1.1</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1.2">1.2</a> etc;) but not subsubsection numbers; <br />
- an <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+activity">activity</a> tag for when a link was referenced in the context of an activity;<br />
- <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+maintext">maintext</a> when a link appeared in the main text of a section; and<br />
- <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+furtherReading">furtherReading</a> when a link appeared as an optional/further reading link.</p>

<p>I also tagged <em>all</em> the links as <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/usr:tu120+1+courseLink">courseLink</a> to show they were provided as part of the course materials.</p>

<p>My choice of tags was in part determined by the sorts of info that could be trivially automatically extracted from the course XML, because this sort of process should be automated if we are to offer course related link bundles more formally.</p>

<p>I didn't any 'semantic' tags; (sub)sections of the course are not semantically tagged either (even the XML markup is biassed towards presentation related tags, as you may guess if you've seen the OUschema that the OpenLearn course materials are being release as on the <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk">Labspace</a> site).</p>

<p>It did occur to me that it may be possible to use services like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html">Yahoo's content analysis/tag extraction service</a> to offer tag suggestions for our content, but I haven't tried this yet. (There's another experiment for me to try with some OpenLearn content.. It would also be good if we could get visitors to the OpenLearn and Labspace sites tagging material? ;-)</p>

<p>It may also be interesting to use delicious (or other social bookmarking system) tag recommendations for a particular URL to help automate tag selection for particular URLs?</p>

<p>Ideally, though, external link bookmarks should be semantically tagged in a similar way to the context they appear in in the course materials/the section of the course content they came from. Semantic relations between links and the context they appear in within the course materials would then be preserved in a far more robust way that using section numbers: using tags like <em>1.1</em> are brittle, particularly if the content moves. Using tags like <a href="http://del.icio.us/ouseful/example+cluster+searchengine"><em>example+cluster+searchengine</em></a> are far more robust, especially if that sort of sense can be extracted from the course material automatically.</p>

<p>2) <em>Delicious displays results in reverse chronological order.</em> I put the links into delcious in the order in  which they appeared in the course materials, so viewing them gives a reverse presentation order view; the same is true when you pull links out of delicious via a web feed; I don't know if this can be switched to chronological order? It's easy enough to write a script that would act as a relay and reverse the order of links, I guess, so there's yet another thig for the to do list...</p>

<p>3) The links can be made available in several ways</p>

<p> - exported as bookmarks/favourites into a browser (for example, using nested folders of bookmarks organised by section, topic,  or category), or viewed as live bookmarks;<br />
- displayed in a webtop like PageFlakes or  Netvibes, or viewed  in Grazr; for example, here are several ways of using an OPML bundle to provide <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/openlearnplayground/grazrNav.php?u=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120playground/tu120_1.opml&s=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">link navigation from a Grazr widget</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGrazr1.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGrazr1.png" width="392" height="253" border="0" /></p>

<p>The navigation on the left actually shows different ways the links may be organised; note that when you  get to the links, they are in reverse order, as discussed above.</p>

<p>Here are a couple more Grazr views:</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGrazr.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGrazr.png" width="482" height="307" border="0" /></p>

<p>4) It's easy enough getting the links out of delicious and putting them into a <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google custom search engine</a> like this <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=009190243792682903990%3A6urthaytduc">TU120 search engine</a> (week 1 links only, at the moment):</p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGoogle.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGoogle.png" width="397" height="425" border="0" /></p>

<p><img alt="tu120LinksGoogle2.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120LinksGoogle2.png" width="607" height="329" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr">searchfeedr</a> will also let you narrow the search down to 15 sites at a time, which would be ok for a section search; here's an example search over <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/searchfeedrlabs.php?f=ouseful/usr:tu120+1.1&amp;q=september+11&t=d&se=y&s=pages">external links from  TU120 section 1.1</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="tu120Linkssearchfeedr.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/tu120Linkssearchfeedr.png" width="1057" height="588" border="0" /></p>

<p>This exercise raised many more questions for me than it answered. For example, </p>

<p>a) how should we go about tagging link resources? One way might be to get students to add the semantic tags, and we could just provide architectural/administrative tagging? ;-)<br />
b) user scenarios: how might students use linkrolls? How should we organise, distribute, promote, embed and/or link to external link rolls, if at all?</p>

<p>That databases and other resource collections have value in their own right is well known.</p>

<p>As we move towards more and more online courses, with course authors presumably continuing to deep link into third party sites (even if we are only supposed to link to the top level of a domain ;-) I think its worth asking how the knowledge locked up in linkrolls/link collections can be unlocked, as well as exploring ways in which further value can be added.</p>

<p>PS having put the links into delicious, I also realised I should have used <a href="http://simpy.com">Simpy</a>. Simpy offers private groups, which means we can keep our IP locked up, even if we do use a third party social bookmarking service ;-)<br />
PPS for newish readers to the blog who are interested in issues relating to the use of social bookmarking in formal education, you may be interested in reading <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005107.html">Towards a Managed Social Bookmarking Environment in Higher Education</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>Okay - here's another OU recruitment round-up post prompted, as ever, by a job ad I saw in today's Technology Guardian supplement for a <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2671&ref=ext">Product Development Manager</a>.</p>

<p>As we go about "re-defining elearning" (as what, I wonder?) the <em>Product</em> Development Manager will help manage "our move from print to the web as a primary delivery medium". </p>

<p>[I'm always twitchy as to how well that fits in with the Widening Partcipation (or even, widening participation) agenda (there are several posts open that programme too - check out the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/jobs-external.asp">general recruitment site</a> for more info). Because I'd be very surprised if the majority of OU students have sole, quality access to broadband connected PCs (and I use the 'PC' term advisedly...). But that's an argument for another time and place...]</p>

<p>Anyway - the Product Development Manager:<br />
<blockquote>will be a proven innovator capable of managing staff in a creative environment and have expertise in modern publishing technologies. Experience of software, print and web production processes, and appreciation of the role of new technologies in developing high-quality, value-for-money multi-media materials is essential.</blockquote></p>

<p>To see where the post is in the wider scheme of things, you could always take a look at the OU organisational charts (available under the Freedom of Information Act, for some reason, <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/p3_7.shtml">here</a>). In particular, check out the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/foi/pics/d17350.ppt">organisational chart for LTS</a>. Slide 13 of 25 (?!) is the one I think you want... <em>if</em> these charts do accurately describe the current organisation of LTS, that is:</p>

<p><img alt="ltsOrgChart.png" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ltsOrgChart.png" width="747" height="498" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you go for it, it's probably best <em>not</em> to mention you saw the ad here ;-) That said, as one of the duties is:<br />
<blockquote>ensuring that staff involved in media production are kept informed about new pedagogic and technical possibilities across the range of media for learning and teaching, and that best practice is transferred across the University</blockquote><br />
I'll probably add you to my mailing list if they haven't thrown me out before then... ;-)</p>

<p>However, please do give me a plug as to where you saw the ad if you go for either of the two Research Fellow positions on "Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web":</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2677">Research Fellow: Semantic Web and Grid Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in the area of semantic web and Grid services - applying semantic web technology to support the management of web and Grid services. This work takes place within the context of our EU-funded project Living Human Digital Library (LHDL) which will create the technical infrastructure for the <a href="http://www.tecno.ior.it/VRLAB/LHP/">Living Human project</a>.</p>

<p>- <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=2676">Research Fellow: Semantic Web Services, Creating the Next Generation Web</a> to undertake research in applying semantic web services to eLearning as part of the Euro-funded <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/luisa/">LUISA</a> project.</p>

<p>Both those posts appear to offer a home for Lisp hackers, so if Lisp's your thing, here's a rare opportunity to <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/lisp.do">earn less than the going rate</a>... (does anyone teach Lisp nowadays? ;-) </p>

<p>Just by the by, also from <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk">ITJobsWatch</a> [ ...  ;-)] here's the trend for <a href="http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/ajax.do">Ajax related jobs</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="ajaxJobs.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/ajaxJobs.jpg" width="451" height="262" border="0" /></p>

<p>One thing I'd love to spend a bit of time looking at would be seeing how things like IT developer job ad trends correlate not only across different programming languages, but also with book trends (e.g. as explored by <a href="http://research.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Research</a>).</p>

<p>For example, it would be neat if the IT Jobs Watch site could produce charts like this one about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/08/programming_language_trends_1.html">Programming Language Books - Relative Trends</a></p>

<p><img src="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/plangtrend.png" width='480' height='310' alt='programming language trends chart' /></p>

<p>and even neater if you could plot both sets of data against each other. E.g. do the books lead or lag the job market?</p>

<p>I suppose there's always <a href="http://google.co.uk/trends?q=%22ruby+on+rails%22%2Cjavascript%2Cajax%2Cc%2B%2B">Google Trends</a> to look at too, though that data is a) far from complete, and b) likely to be very noisy...</p>

<p><img alt="gTrendProgLang.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gTrendProgLang.jpg" width="592" height="316" border="0" /></p>

<p>PS the <em>Further Particulars</em> for the Product Manager job state:<br />
<blockquote>The Open University currently requires its academic, research and academic-related staff to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.  For this reason, we are unable to accept applications from individuals over the age of 65.  Applications will be accepted from individuals under the age of 65, however, individuals should note that once employed they will be required to retire on the 30th September following their 65th birthday.</blockquote></p>

<p>Nice to know we're open as to age in our employment policy....<br />
<blockquote>From 1 October 2006, new laws protect workers from age discrimination. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations make it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees, trainees or job seekers because of their age and ensure that all workers, regardless of age, have the same rights in terms of training and promotion.<br />
...<br />
All employees will have the right to request to work beyond the age of 65 or any other retirement age (if there is one) set by the company, and employers will have a duty to consider, although not to accept, such a request. This will involve an employee meeting with their employer to discuss the request. An employee will have a right of appeal if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the meeting. This policy will be reviewed in 2011. <br />
<a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/newsdetail.cfm?sectionID=44&newsid=678">Age Discrimination Legislation - information and help for employers and individuals  </a></blockquote><br />
Err...? How does that work then? Maybe I'm missing something... Can you be considered to have considered something, even if you know beforehand what answer you are going to give?</p>

<!--
<p>Yesterday, I posted details about  <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008527.html">Wikimail</a> and linked to a Greasemonkey script that embedded a wiki in a Gmail message on receipt of a wikimail message. For today's post, I've extended the script so that its easy to post - and create - wikimail messages in Gmail.</p>

<p>As before, I've produced both a Greasemonkey script and a Firefox extension: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/wikimail2.user.js">wikimail Greasemonkey script</a>, <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/gmailwikimail.xpi">wikimail Firefox extension</a>.</p>

<p>To send a wikimail from one Gmail account to another, click on the 'Compose Mail' link in the normal way. The compose toolbar in the send form is augmented with a text box and a link to 'Create wikimail'. Enter the name of the wiki page you want to send in the text box using the same syntax as described previously.</p>

<p>For example: <em>wikimaildemo.wikidot</em> or <em>wikimaildemo.wikidot/newWikiMessage</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend1.jpg" width="852" height="246" border="0" /></p>

<p>Click on the link and the corresponding wiki opens within Gmail:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend2.jpg" width="707" height="299" border="0" /></p>

<p>If the wiki page already exists, it will be opened for editing. For a wikidot wiki, if the wiki page does not exist you will be offered the opportunity to create it. The wikimaildemo.wikidot wiki has been set up to allow anonymous access, so if you want to try out using wikimail, feel free to use that wiki and create your own wiki page.<br />
 <br />
Edit the wiki and commit the changes.</p>

<p>When the wiki was opened, awikimail link to the wiki that was created (if it was a new wiki) or opened (if it already existed) is automatically added to the body of the message that wil actually be sent. Note that if you have already typed something into the body of the message, it will be lost.</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend3.jpg" width="282" height="73" border="0" /></p>

<p>Now all you have to do is send the message to another Gmail user (if you want to add additional text to the body of the message, now's the time to do it):</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend4.jpg" width="595" height="70" border="0" /></p>

<p>When the recipient opens the message, they will see the wikimail link and any other text you added to the body of the message.</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend5.jpg" width="640" height="195" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking the <em>Show/hide wikimail</em> link will open the wiki:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimailSend6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimailSend6.jpg" width="498" height="211" border="0" /></p>

<p>So there we have it - an end to end wikimail solution in Gmail :-)</p>

<p>If you want to try it and you don't have a Gmail account, mail me - I still have a few invites left.</p>

<h3 class="title">Read/Write Email with Wikimail</h3>

A couple of things over the weekend brought the idea of Wikimail - Read/Write email back to mind, so a half hour hack on Saturday and a chat with the handily online Brian Suda (who suggested the Read/Write Email moniker)...
<!--
<p>A couple of things over the weekend brought the idea of <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005488.html">Wikimail</a> - <em>Read/Write email</em> back to mind, so a half hour hack on Saturday and a chat with the handily online <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian Suda</a> (who suggested the Read/Write Email moniker) mean there's a basic demo now available...</p>

<p>For those who don't want to click thru to the past for the background, the idea behind wikimail was to use email to pass a wiki backwards and forwards. Instead of reading an email message and replying to it, what I wanted for certain classes of email exchange was a more collaborative writing space, and a wiki seemed to offer an appropriate solution.</p>

<p>At this point, it's worth explaining that I work from home a lot, and I take part in way too many conversations that aren't really suited to email (part of the reason for trying to move some of them to chat/IM conversations).</p>

<p>In particular, one class of conversation that I think the structure of email exchanges often gets in the way of  is an ongoing discussion, in which an informal document (maybe even a proto-blog post) is constructed over several email exchanges in the same thread. The conversants reply to replies, insert new comments within the flow of quoted text from previous emails, and maybe delete chunks portions of previously quoted text too.</p>

<p>So that's the itch behind the wikimail scratch: rather than developing a conversation through multiple levels of quotation and 'reply with quote' trauma, conversants could develop an idea via the wiki in their email space. The important thing was not to move the players out of their email client - the exchange should proceed within the email environment.</p>

<p>But first - what were things that brought it to mind this time round?</p>

<p>Firstly, I was looking for a free wiki that I could display in the tools frame of <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">StrinGLE</a> . When I first toyed with the idea of wikimail I tried embedding a Mediawiki wiki in an frame in Gmail - but it wanted to go to the top of the window, so I went on to playing with other things. Over the weekend, I came across a couple of  free wikis that seemed to suit the bill  - <a href="http://www.pbwiki.com/">PBwiki</a> and <a href="http://wikidot.com">Wikidot</a>...</p>

<p>Secondly, I've started wondering about the extent to which Gmail can act as the single interface to a lot of my online activity. I use the mail tools daily, GTalk instant messaging too, and although I've got the <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">Google Reader in Gmail Greasemonkey script</a> installed, I don't actually use it (I'm still on Bloglines, and wondering whether to switch to Google Reader...):</p>

<p><img alt="gReaderInGmail.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gReaderInGmail.jpg" width="423" height="225" border="0" /></p>

<p>Thirdly was the news that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/spot-on.html">Google had bought Jotspot</a>, and I started wondering what hey were going to do with it... Jotspot wikis allow users to email comments in, with the mail comments appear at the bottom of the wiki page, if I remember correctly, but that all seemed a bit clunky when I played with it ages ago...</p>

<p>So - the time was right, and it took less than ten minutes to hack an old Greasemonkey script that would search the body of an open email message in Gmail for a keyphrase (like <em>wikimail:wikimaildemo.pbwiki</em>) and replace it with an iframe containing the wiki - <em>http://wikimaildemo.pbwiki.com</em>, for example.</p>

<p>There were significant usability problems with the initial, ultimately crude script (and I'm afraid I haven't addressed most of them yet, Brian...! Nor have I had a chance to play with Backpack...) and the application is not, as yet, very portable... i.e. it's restricted at the mo to Firefox and Gmail.</p>

<p>One major issue with the original script was that it was impossible to reply to a wikimail message, although I have fixed that problem, after a fashion...</p>

<p>Anyway - here's the demo; if you have <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> installed in <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> and you want to try it out, install the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/wikimail2.user.js">wikimail4gmail Greasemonkey script</a> and have a play...</p>

<p>Alternatively, there's a <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/gmailwikimail.xpi">Firefox wikimail extension</a> generated via <a href="http://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler">this Greasemonkey compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The wikimial script/extension will rewrite wikimail addresses as follows:</p>

<p>- <em>wikimail:some.domain</em> is rewritten as <em><strong>http://</strong>some.domain<strong>.com</strong></em> <br />
- <em>wikimail:some.domain/path</em> is rewritten as <em><strong>http://</strong>some.domain<strong>.com</strong>/path</em> (which means it can address subpages in a wiki)</p>

<p>Follow the cribs in the screenshots to find some demo/test wikis. The wikidot one allows anonymous access...</p>

<p>For example, here's a message in Gmail:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail1.jpg" width="461" height="239" border="0" /></p>

<p>See the <em>Show/hide wikimail</em> over on the right? The wikimail script put that there (if anyone can give me a better graphic, that would be appreciated ;-). Here's what happens if you click it:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail2.jpg" width="423" height="338" border="0" /></p>

<p>(Err - the URL for the GM script is incorrect in that screenshot - I've corrected it in the wiki though ;-)</p>

<p>A wiki appears. In this case, you will need to login (if you haven't already). That wiki is set up to allow guests in with password 'demo', so you can try it out if you want. Of course, you could always link to a private wiki (i.e. on ewith restricted access).</p>

<p>If you click on the <em>Show/hide wikimail</em> link again, the wiki will close.</p>

<p>It is sometimes sort of possible to link to a wiki that doesn't exist yet:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail3.jpg" width="620" height="195" border="0" /></p>

<p>Sort of:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail4.jpg" width="785" height="369" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's a wiki on another site:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail5.jpg" width="242" height="100" border="0" /></p>

<p>This one is set up for anonymous access, so anyone can go in and play - and also create new pages:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail6.jpg" width="565" height="324" border="0" /></p>

<p>This shows how to set up a wikimail link to point to a subpage:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail8.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail8.jpg" width="307" height="114" border="0" /></p>

<p>This means you can use the email thread to construct a conversation over serveral wikimail pages; or use one wiki for wikimail, with different pages for each wikimal thread:</p>

<p><img alt="wikimail7.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/wikimail7.jpg" width="418" height="236" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are still a few issues with closing wikimail frames in long reply threads, but a page refresh will usually sort that out if it's too annoying...</p>

<p>If you don't grok it from this description, try the script out ;-)</p>

<p>And if you do give it a spin, please let me know how you get on...</p>

<!--
<p>One of the great things about the <a href="http://docs.grazr.com/script/spec/1.0/">GrazrScript form elements</a> is that they turn Grazr from being 'just' a feed reading and navigation widget into a platform for feed based widget development. If you can find a hackable feed URL, then you can probably do something interesting with it in Grazr :-)</p>

<p>So  - here's my proper first effort (apart from the Hennepin County Library Catalogue search that is demoed in <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">Stringle</a>, of course...) - a couple of Amazon Search Widgets (I'll provide screen shots first, then embed the demos at the end of the post; I suspect this won't show up in a feedreader, so to see them you may have to click through to the full post on <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ouseful">Feedburner</a> or at the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blog">OUseful blog</a>).</p>

<p>I actually produced two separate widgets that demonstrate the <em>inline</em> and <em>outline</em> ('federated') approaches that the current version of GrazrScript forms support.</p>

<p>Firstly, the 'outline' approach - a search widget that lets you search over several categories at once.</p>

<p>Here's the basic interface:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazonMulti1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazonMulti1.jpg" width="305" height="350" border="0" /></p>

<p>You can select the locale/Amazon shop by country:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazonMulti2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazonMulti2.jpg" width="227" height="205" border="0" /></p>

<p>When you've entered the search (in this case for "space ritual" ;-) the search is run over several different Amazon categories:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazonMulti3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazonMulti3.jpg" width="274" height="175" border="0" /></p>

<p>I want the <em>music</em> result:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazonMulti4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazonMulti4.jpg" width="286" height="212" border="0" /></p>

<p>Nice one :-)</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazonMulti5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazonMulti5.jpg" width="303" height="234" border="0" /></p>

<p>Secondly - the inline approach. In this case, we are just going to pull in a single result feed. The main interface is similar to the previous one, except that now you can select the item category as well:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazon1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazon1.jpg" width="304" height="216" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here are the options I put in to start with:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazon2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazon2.jpg" width="241" height="256" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's a search over electrical goods:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazon3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazon3.jpg" width="272" height="211" border="0" /></p>

<p>And here's the result:</p>

<p><img alt="gAmazon4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/gAmazon4.jpg" width="288" height="223" border="0" /></p>

<p>Creating these widgets was easy, once I'd cobbled together an XSL stylesheet that transformed the Amazon webservice search results into RSS.</p>

<p>There was also a GrazrScript gotcha that got me (you can read about it on the <a href="http://forums.grazr.com/forum.php?id=2">GrazrScript forums</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway - feel free to have a play, and maybe even try out one of these widgets on your own site.</p>

<p>Firstly, here's the multisearch widget (<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazonMulti.opml">GrazrScript powered Amazon search widget over multiple categories</a>):</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazonMulti.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazonMulti.opml"></script>
</div>

<p>Then the inline search (<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazon.opml">GrazrScript powered Amazon search widget</a>):</p>

<div style="height:350px;width:300px;">
<a href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazon.opml" target="gz"><img src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" border="0" /></a>
<script defer="defer" type="text/javascript" src="http://grazr.com/gzloader.js?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrAmazon.opml"></script>
</div>

<p>It's easy to embed these search widgets in your own page - just follow the link(s) above and then look for the <em>Add to your page</em> link that Grazr kindly provides :-)</p>

<p>PS here's a quick way of customising a Grazr/Amazon search widget to let you 'hardwire' the locale and product type for the search. There are two buttons in the form  - one uses Javascript, the other doesn't:<br />
<script type="text/javascript">function createGrazr(){var countryNode=document.getElementById("country");var country=countryNode.options[countryNode.selectedIndex].value;var searchtypeNode=document.getElementById("searchtype");var searchtype=searchtypeNode.options[searchtypeNode.selectedIndex].value;window.location="http://grazr.com/config.html?file=http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonOPML.php?country="+country+"&searchtype="+searchtype;}</script><form name="amznform" action="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonRedirect.php" method="GET">Amazon Search:<br />
Locale: <select name="country" id="country"><option value="uk">Amazon.co.uk</option><option value="ca">Amazon.ca</option><option value="us">Amazon.com</option><option value="de">Amazon.de</option><option value="jp">Amazon.jp</option><option value="fr">Amazon.fr</option></select><br />
Shop: <select name="searchtype" id="searchtype"><option value="Books">Books</option><option value="Classical">Classical Music</option><option value="DVD">DVD</option><option value="Electronics">Electronics</option><option value="Software">Software</option><option value="Music">Music</option><option value="SoftwareVideoGames">Software &amp; Games</option><option value="Toys">Toys &amp; Games</option></select><br />
Javascript: <input type="button" value="Grazr It!" onclick="createGrazr()" /><br />
Form Action: <input type="submit" value="Grazr It!" /></form></p>

<p>If the form doesn't appear in you feedreader, you can find one here: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazr/grazrAmazonConfig.html">Amazon/Grazr search widget customiser</a></p>

<h3 class="title">(Library Catalogue) Search Forms in Grazr</h3>

<!--
<p>One of the things I've been trying to figure out for Stringle is how to get search forms into the OPML fed navigation widget. RSS feeds can carry form elements, which was how I was going to try and address the problem.</p>

<p>But no need - because today <a href="http://blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/03/grazrscript-beta/">Grazr announced GrazrScript</a>, "a programming language for feeds".<br />
<blockquote>At its core GrazrScript runs against a web service that parses the special GrazrScript directives embedded in the files to do interesting things and returns valid OPML or Feed files. GrazrScript 1.0 allows the embedding of XHTML forms, and a 'search and replace' template that, while relatively simple, enables all sorts of interesting applications.</blockquote></p>

<p>Here's a v quick demo, in StrinGLE, of using GrazrScript to provide a search in Grazr over the <a href="http://www.hclib.org/pub/">Hennepin County Library</a>, which has an OpenSearch/RSS interface to its Library Catalogue - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php?s=http%3A//blog.grazr.com/index.php/2006/11/03/grazrscript-beta/&o=http%3A//ouseful.open.ac.uk/grazrScriptDemo1.opml">GrazrScript library catalogue search in StrinGLE</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the top level navigation - you can see the link to the library catalogue search area:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript1.jpg" width="706" height="262" border="0" /></p>

<p>Here's the search box:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript2.jpg" width="247" height="171" border="0" /></p>

<p>Make a search - note you can also click through to get the result in the main web window:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript3.jpg" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>

<p>If you prefer, check out the search result in the Grazr widget:</p>

<p><img alt="grazrScript4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/grazrScript4.jpg" width="394" height="325" border="0" /></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how GrzrScript develops, but this is a really good start :-)</p>

<p>Now I wonder, is there a SPARQL results to RSS stylesheet out there anywhere?</p>

<p>PS I just pinched the code for a more complex (job search) form involving several form elements, including drop down lists, from the <a href="http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2006/11/feed_applicatio.html">Eirepreneur</a> blog,  and added it to the demo...</p>

<p>Job ads are potentially a good fit for open educational sites (targeted at adult learners) that need to pay their way with advertising, or affiliate/commission/referral fees, I think...? (Though note that that's not how they're being used here...)</p>

<h3 class="title">SPARQLing OUseful Info</h3>

<!--
<p>I've just started wondering (for which, read: 'asking naive questions of people who know about this stuff') how to mark up content in a semantic learning environment (and what such an environment might look like), particularly if it was built out of bits of string'n'glue, so the OUseful posts are quite likely to be littered with basic semantic web exploratory doodles over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>For starters, I think I need to find out what I can do around the search tool front, using SPARQL to query RDF stores. At the moment, I haven't got an RDF version of any OpenLearn content up (maybe I'll do a minimal XSLT over the weekend?) so the next best(?) thing (in that I'm familiar with the content of it) is the RDF feed out of the OUseful blog.</p>

<p>The SPARQL  processor I'm going to use at first is <a href="http://sparql.org/sparql.html">SPARQLer</a>. Here's an example query using it:</p>

<p><img alt="sparql1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sparql1.jpg" width="704" height="462" border="0" /></p>

<p>and an <a href="http://sparql.org/sparql?query=PREFIX+rdf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+dc%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fdc%2Felements%2F1.1%2F%3E%0D%0APREFIX+rss%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Frss%2F1.0%2F%3E%0D%0ASELECT+%3Ftitle+%0D%0AWHERE+%7B+%3Fitem+rdf%3Atype+rss%3Aitem+.%0D%0A+++++++%3Fitem+rss%3Atitle+%3Ftitle+.%0D%0A+++++++%3Fitem+rss%3Adescription+%3Fdescription+.%0D%0A+++++++FILTER+regex%28%3Ftitle%2C+%22OpenLearn%22%29+%7D&default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59%2Findex.rdf&stylesheet=xml-to-html.xsl">example result</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="sparql2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sparql2.jpg" width="450" height="215" border="0" /></p>

<p>SPARQLer can apply an arbitrary stylesheet to the results, or a JSON results feed (<a href="http://sparql.org/sparql?query=PREFIX+rdf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+dc%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fdc%2Felements%2F1.1%2F%3E%0D%0APREFIX+rss%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Frss%2F1.0%2F%3E%0D%0ASELECT+%3Ftitle+%3Fdescription%0D%0AWHERE+%7B+%3Fitem+rdf%3Atype+rss%3Aitem+.%0D%0A+++++++%3Fitem+rss%3Atitle+%3Ftitle+.%0D%0A+++++++%3Fitem+rss%3Adescription+%3Fdescription+.%0D%0A+++++++FILTER+regex%28%3Ftitle%2C+%22OpenLearn%22%29+%7D%0D%0A&default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.open.ac.uk%2FMaths%2Fajh59%2Findex.rdf&stylesheet=xml-to-html.xsl&output=json">example</a>), as well as the pure XML result.</p>

<p>Which actually (by default) popped up this 'error' dialogue in my browser:</p>

<p><img alt="sparqlMime.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sparqlMime.jpg" width="451" height="341" border="0" /></p>

<p>Hmm - might it be handy if I could provide a web application URL that would take 'this sort' of document and display it via a third party website? </p>

<p>Anyway, that's off topic :-) Time to go and learn how to speak SPARQL, I think...</p>

<!--
<p>Driving home earlier this week, I wondered how useful it would be if Stringle - the string'n'glue learning environment - could support multiple tabbed panels. The problem of where to put the search box - and display the much larger search results page - was also bugging me.</p>

<p>The structure at the moment already separates out navigation (a Grazr widget), itinerant functionality (third party widgets, in the demo case provided via Widgetbox) and a web browsing area.</p>

<p>So just to try the look';n;feel'usability, here's a very rough cut - <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle2.php">Stringle v2</a> that uses a tabbed area to provide two main display areas - one ('Web') for viewing any old web page (this is the panel that the navigation widget opens content into) and one ('Tools') that applications are loaded into.</p>

<p>Providing two tabs also made me realise that the <em>only</em> way of loading a page into the web content area was via the navigation panel. This seems a bit limiting, so I have added a URL address box so that you can open any page in that central area (which works unless the page being loaded insists on being at the top window level and not embedded in a frame):<br />
 <br />
<img alt="stringle5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle5.jpg" width="771" height="265" border="0" /></p>

<p>At the moment I have hardcoded topbar navigation links in to a search tool (<a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/searchfeedr">searchfeedr</a>), a chat tool (<a href="http://www.geesee.com/">Geesee</a>), a word processor/spreadsheet app (<a href="http://docs.google.com">Google docs</a> - though there is an issue that actual docs are opened into a new window...) and a drawing tool (<a href="http://gliffy.com">gliffy</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking on an application link in the topbar navigation area opens the application in the Tools panel:</p>

<p><img alt="stringle6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle6.jpg" width="738" height="271" border="0" /></p>

<p>If I get a chance, I'll try and tweak this so that a delicious feed can be used to pull in the topbar navigation links.</p>

<p>The styling is also a real mess, but tweaking stylesheets still takes me far longer that it should, so you'll just have to put up with the mess, I'm afraid...</p>

<h3 class="title">Annotating Local, Navigable Copies of OpenLearn Content</h3>

Early this week I came across quite the most amazing Firefox extension I've seen for some time - Scrapbook. This extension lets you make a local (i.e. offline) copy of a site, and then do various nifty things with it...
<!--
<p>Early this week I came across quite the most amazing Firefox extension I've seen for some time - <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/">Scrapbook</a>. This extension lets you make a local (i.e. offline) copy of a site, and then do various nifty things with it  - make personal annotations (or even shared ones if you have shared drive access), text highlighting, even search.</p>

<p>This extension particularly resonated with me when I came across it because earlier in the day we had been discussing at <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/tu120">TU120</a> course team meeting the frequently asked question about how long students retain access to course materials from our online courses. (Several weeks is the answer - then the material is no longer avialable).</p>

<p>There is also a not totally unrelated issue <em>at the moment</em> with <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> content, in the sense that the URLs for the current materials appear not to be very stable (though I have been told this is something that will be addressed in the near future...) - so while the content may stay up there, it may not be at the place you bookmarked...</p>

<p>Anyway - printing out online materials is one way of getting a persistent copy of onine materials, as is downloading them - although when pages can only be saved one at a time this can be quite a time consuming process.</p>

<p>So this is one area where Scrapbook caught my interest - the ability to download very easily all the pages from a course. So for example, we could go to the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1617">index page of an OpenLearn course</a>, which has links to all the course content pages from it, and use those links to download all the course information:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb1.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb1.jpg" width="577" height="596" border="0" /></p>

<p><em>A similar approach can be used for saving local copies of Technology short course pages: go to the course index page (that is, click on the Index tab , rather than Home tab) of a <a href="http://tscp.open.ac.uk/">Relevant Knowledge course</a> and download in one go the course content pages linked to therefrom. Readers of this blog on any of these courses may wish to pass this info on via a course <s>conference</s> forum ;-)</em></p>

<p>Grabbing the index page - and the pages that are linked to from it - is easy: simply take the 'Capture Page As..' option from the Scrapbook menu:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb2.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb2.jpg" width="310" height="144" border="0" /></p>

<p>You now have to configure the download - take the links of depth  1:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb3.jpg" width="407" height="501" border="0" /></p>

<p>This gives you a list of <em>all</em> the pages that are linked to, which is way more than the ones you actually want:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb4.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb4.jpg" width="455" height="507" border="0" /></p>

<p>There are two ways of getting round this - one is to pause the download as soon as you can and just select the pages you want to download. One way of identifying which links those are is to hover over the links you want to download (or exclude) on the index page and make a note of the URL that should appear in the status bar at the bottom left corner of the browser window:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb5.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb5.jpg" width="423" height="107" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another way is to use the skip button to skip the download of the next link in the download list - there is a 3 second delay between downloads to give you time to make this decision for each link.</p>

<p> <img alt="olsb6.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb6.jpg" width="425" height="110" border="0" /></p>

<p>For this 'Capture Page As...' download option., all the saved files are access via a single Scrapbook item, which you can find in the Scrapbook sidebar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb8.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb8.jpg" width="462" height="314" border="0" /></p>

<p>(It is also possible to save each page as separate Scrapbook items, although local navigation between the pages will not then be respected.)</p>

<p>If you select an item in the Scrapbook, you are taken to the local copy of that Scrapbook item. Two toolbars are then available at the bottom of the screen, that can be configured from the Scrapbook item right at the bottom of the browser window:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb9.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb9.jpg" width="199" height="177" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Edit toolbar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb10.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb10.jpg" width="444" height="29" border="0" /></p>

<p>And the Info toolbar:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb11.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb11.jpg" width="405" height="28" border="0" /></p>

<p>The Info toolbar actually provides a sitemap to all the pages you downloaded:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb12.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb12.jpg" width="452" height="270" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is handy, because although the downloaded material has all the links localised, (so the navigation through the OpenLearn material is within your downloaded local copy of the material) the current OpenLearn navigation through materials is all but unusable (although <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/008189.html">solutions are in principle available</a>).</p>

<p>The utility of the Scrapbook as a study support tool now moves up another gear. For example, you can highlight or annotate the saved content:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb13.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb13.jpg" width="287" height="127" border="0" /></p>

<p>Annotations can either be inline (and displayed via a popup tooltip) or floating 'post-it' type notes:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb15.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb15.jpg" width="181" height="46" border="0" /></p>

<p>Another hand tool is the ability to search through the save content:</p>

<p><img alt="olsb16.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/olsb16.jpg" width="706" height="538" border="0" /></p>

<p>More tools are available too -  the <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/files/ScrapbookTutorial-1.1.pdf">Scrapbook tutorial</a> is well worth a read, even if you don't get this extension, just so you know what you're missing out on.</p>

<p>One thing I liked in particular that I picked up from the tutorial was the add-on (yep - the Scrapbook extension can be extended with further add-ons - how neat is that? ;-) that allows you to back up your local, annotated, archived materials up to the <a href="http://box.net">box.net</a> online storage service (which I actually first got into through the <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/?source=2e583676-5fde-4234-ace8-861af6db4b3e">PageFlakes</a> webtop...).</p>

<p>If the new OU <em>MyStuff</em> ePortfolio supports an API, then it may be worth hacking together an extension for Scrapbook so that it can be used with that service.</p>

<p>(Of course, what I'd really like to see is MyStuff provide an option that would allow students to use the MyStuff interface with their own online storage service, so they could keep <em>their</em> content where <em>they</em> wanted.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the ultimate toy would be to add Scrapbook style bulk download functionality (and maybe the annotation and highlighting tools) to  <a href="http://www.zotero.org"">Zotero</a>, which provides more sophisticated collection management tools, as well as bibliographic reference tools?</p>

<p>Tonight's hack - a delicious links to OPML converter - took an hour for some reason, not half an hour, and it's another of those things that I don't really have a use for just now (partly because there are alternatives that I've only just re-remembered - bah:-(, although someone may find it useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deli2opml.html">delicious2OPML generator</a></p>

<p>It reuses several searchfeedr routines that pull delicious content into the page via JSON, and then trashes through them to produce the OPML.</p>

<p>To use it, enter a delicious user name (if you don't specify one, <em>popular</em> is used instead) and an appropriate tag.</p>

<p><img alt="deli2opml.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/deli2opml.jpg" width="645" height="415" border="0" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the OPML is generated in a text box on the page. So in many ways it's not as useful as this <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/005763.html">delicious OPML link generator by Danny Ayers</a>, which uses online XSLT processing to generate the OPML directly from a delicious feed.</p>

<p><em>That's</em> the tool I'd completely forgotten about...</p>

<!--
<p>A couple of days ago I did a <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=%22open+university%22">search on YouTube for "open university"</a> that turned up a couple of OU adverts, as well as some snippets from old OU TV programmes and  a spoof video or two (sometimes it's hard to disambiguate clips of 25 year old OU programmes from recent parodies of the same!). </p>

<p>Of the many rumours flying round about how YouTube is going to make itself pay, advertising is of course a contender - whether that's video advertising to top and tail movie clips, or other forms of on-site advertising, like traditional Google ads.</p>

<p>I guess some people may be asking similar sorts of questions about whether OpenLearn is sustainable once the Hewlett funding runs out (even though we're only really at the start of that funding...)?</p>

<p>I've commented previously (<a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006142.html">Ad Supported Courses</a>) about the possibility of ad-supported courses - maybe a job ad, or two, or even the occasional dating agency ad?! (I believe the latter often goes hand in hand with divorce lawyers!). And I suppose to an extent in some weird internal market sort of way, links to the main OU site from OpenLearn could be deemed to have a certain value.</p>

<p>Anyway - internally there is keen interest (and maybe, I hear, even a sweepstake or two;-) on the number of people:</p>

<p>a) registering (for free, of course) onto the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">OpenLearn</a> site, </p>

<p>b) going on to request more information about related OU courses, and then </p>

<p>c) actually registering for a course.</p>

<p>This 'try before you buy' element of OpenLearn is, I assume, one of the arguments that helped persuade the beancounters that there may be a financial payoff from OpenLearn - over and above the project funding and the undoubted social good payoff that will hopefully result from making our content available.</p>

<p>And if the early day rumours are to be believed, things are looking promising...</p>

<p>The following clip from a recent blog post suggests that the OpenLearn materials may draw not just new students into the OU, but that they may also be used to help current students in their future course choice:</p>

<blockquote>I found an announcement on the StudentHome website that OU opens some of its learning resources to the broad public on a site called OpenLearn.
...
I'm curious to see how this will develop and if it might help me in choosing appropriate courses for the future... if this turns out to be the right thing for me."</blockquote>
<a href="http://oustudent.blogspot.com/2006/10/open-university-open-openlearn.html">"OU Student"</a>

<p>This resonates strongly with an email that crossed my desk last week commenting on how - even though we have e-book versions of all our current study guides - these are only available to students currently studying the corresponding course and apparently <em>not</em> to students who are considering taking the course.</p>

<p>Which means that students can only look at course materials to see if the course is right for them by going to their local study centre and checking out the OU materials there (you'll find a set in most academic libraries, I think...).</p>

<p>Part of the reasoning behind the lock down of content is, I assume, the belief amongst some people that the content is the key part of our contract with students and that if OUr content is free, the students won't come, something that OpenLearn may help to disprove.</p>

<p>What often seems to be ignored is that even if OUr content is free, the added value of open access, supported open learning (including academic support from local and regional tutors), a vibrant online student community (<em>in general</em>, as well as associated with particular courses), assessment and academic feedback and - let's not forget the ultimate goal for many - an accredited, often professionally recognised Higher Education qualification at the end of the day all contribute to the reasons why people choose to study with the OU.</p>

<p><em>It's not just the content...</em></p>

<h3 class="title">StrinGLE URL "API"</h3>

<p>Just a quick post to say I've put a tweaked version of Stringle in a new location: <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle1.php">http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle1.php</a> and added a very clunky configuration tool:</p>

<p><img alt="stringle3.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringle3.jpg" width="256" height="245" border="0" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the 'Configure StrinGLE' link will open up the configuration panel, where you can enter (optional) URLs for the navigation OPML file and the 'splash' HTML page - that is, the one that loads when you first load the page.</p>

<p>When you click on the 'set URLs' button, the 'Link to new configuration' link will be configured to load a StrinGLE page using the supplied URL(s) when it is clicked.</p>

<p>The link uses the following URL arguments:</p>

<p><em>http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/stringle1.php?s=SPLASH-URL&o=OPML-URL</em></p>

<p>You should enter URLs in the form: <em>http://www.bbc.co.uk</em> (which could be used to load the BBC home page as the splash screen, for example).</p>

<p>The <em>s=</em> argument sets the splash screen, the <em>o=</em> argument sets the navigation OPML URL. There is a third switch available, <em>w=</em> that lets you define the URL that loads the Widgetbox widget panel script.</p>

<p>Over the next week or two I'll try and tweak the <a href="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbFeedsOPMLFeedBlender.html">social bookmarking OPML feedroller</a> so that it can produce an online feed that will pipe in navigation from a set of organised delicious feeds (so that different tags can be used to set up different navigation feed menus).</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can still use the social bookmarking feedroller to create OPML files that you can save and upload to your own server, and that you can then point to from StrinGLE.</p>

<p>You can also feed the feedroller direct using the OPML link generated for a particular profile by the OPML feedroller (this wasn't working earlier today, but does work now....). If you want to set up feeds for several tags from the same social bookmarking account, separate the different tags by a space:</p>

<p><img alt="sbRollFeeder.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/sbRollFeeder.jpg" width="725" height="293" border="0" /></p>

<p>Use the generated OPML link as the OPML navigation link in Stringle:</p>

<p><img alt="stringleFeedRollFed.jpg" src="http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/stringleFeedRollFed.jpg" width="511" height="289" border="0" /></p>

<p>I knew that feed roller tool would come in handy one day! ;-)</p>
