<h3 class="title">OU Course Code Search on BBC Programme Catalogue</h3>

<p>**It's back - the catalogue seems to have <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/">returned</a> ***</p>

<p>Last week, the BBC released  a beta (err, <em>experimental</em>!;-) version of its <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax">Programme Catalogue Search Tool</a>.</p>

<p>The search results don't link to downloads (yet?) but even so, the catalogue is still a fascinating resource. (There are other media archives, of course (e.g. I have bookmarked a few<a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/archive">here</a>), but some of them are subscription only (e.g. the <a href="http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/">British Universities Film and Video Council</a>), unlike the BBC offering, which is free).)</p>

<p>As well as providing a normal (human readable) web page of search results, machine readable XML (RDF, actually) results are also available, which makes for easy reuse of results.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried out one or two searches for the OU (using search terms 'Open University', OU, etc.). As well as the simple/basic search, I found the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/advanced_search">advanced search page</a> to be very useful.</p>

<p><img alt="BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" src="./BBCCatalogueAdvSearch.jpg" width="693" height="305" border="0" /></p>

<p>The most successful search turned up <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/OU">BBC catalogue search (series): OU</a>, which recorded several thousand entries over the last thirty years.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that a search can be made quite effectively for OU course programmes by course code. For example, here's a search for <em>S322</em>:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:s322</a></p>

<p>That is, just use a query of the form:</p>

<p><em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/search/title:<strong>courseCode</strong></em></p>

<p>I haven't had time to check the OU library to see whether this information is available from any of their catalogues, but I suspect that it isn't(!). No matter  - the RDF feed from each catalogue entry page means that the information is available in a form that can be pulled easily enough into any other page if you know the catalogue entry number for a particular programme.</p>

<p>For example, here's a (human readable) catalogue entry page for a T209 programme:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>And here's the machine readable (XML/RDF)  result:</p>

<p><a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/xml/programme/FOUT697F</a></p>

<p>The translation between the two is simple:</p>

<p>Web page: <em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>infax</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em><br />
RDF page:<em>http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/<strong>xml</strong>/programme/<strong>catID</strong></em></p>

<p>However, I haven't (yet) stumbled on a way of making a query to the catalogue that returns an XML response, which makes finding the results so they can be pulled into a page a little harder...</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a plea to the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC Backstage</a> mailing list (backstage@lists.bbc.co.uk) turned up the answer:</p>

<blockquote>If you want to convert your web-based searches into REST-like requests, you want to pick out the "/infax/" in the url and change it to "/xml/" and "/feed/".</blockquote>

<p>So for example,  the atom/feed search:<br />
<a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/dr%20who</a> works fine, as does <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209">http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/feed/search/t209</a></p>

<p>(Just in passing, most of the results I looked at had a catalogue ID that included <em>OU</em> as the second and third characters. Does anyone happen to know what coding scheme was used to generate catalogue numbers?)</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/">OUseful search</a> tool, I think when I allowed users to search for books/courses by keyword, the search was applied to book titles as well as course titles. I wonder how easy it would be to use the BBC catalogue info in the same way - for example, allowing users to make a general keyword search and then filtering on results that OU programming to identify courses by coursecode that are somehow keyed by a given keyword? </p>

<p>(Even in the BBC Catalogue Advanced Search, I couldn't find a way of combining arguments, e.g. to allow me to search on <em>title AND series</em>. Does anyone know if this is possible and if so, what the syntax is?) <em>Apparently, Boolean search is not supported at the moment..</em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Update</strong>: It seems as if the BBC Programme Catalogue has been taken down while it is in the 'review phase'....</p>
