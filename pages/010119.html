<h3 class="title">Disposable Apps</h3>

<p>Watching a Google Tech Talk <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/pipes-a-tech-talk">presentation by the Yahoo team responsible for Pipes</a> (?!;-), which made it clear that Pipes was intended to be used by the 10% of the Web 2.0 <a href="http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=5">creator pyramid</a>, I was struck by the phrase <em>disposable application(s)</em> used to describe apps that are built to be used only once or twice.</p>

<p>(The tiniest bit of digging also turned up a post commenting on the <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/16/disposable-software/">disposable nature of presentations</a>.)</p>

<p>My department - the <a href="http://ict.open.ac.uk">Dept of ICT</a> - is currently in the middle of Faculty reorganisation that sees us joining with a couple of other departments (<a href="http://systems.open.ac.uk/">Systems</a> and <a href="http://technology.open.ac.uk/tm/">Technology Management</a>, but <em>not</em> <a href="http://www.computing.open.ac.uk/">Computing</a> (don't you just love their URL?) - which <em>is</em> coming into the new Faculty (name tba), but is to be colocated in another part of the campus along with <a href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a>).</p>

<p>As a consequence of the reorganisation, we have a chance to reinvent ourselves yet again (over the last 10-15 years, the dept. has gone from being an electronics dept, to the Dept of Telematics, to the current Dept of ICT. (Computing always and, I suspect, ever shall be 'Computing', though their offerings <em>have</em> changed over time (e.g. they do less computer science than they used to, I think?).)</p>

<p>The department's reinventions have been pretty successful over time, and our courses remain attractive to employers as well as students. A move into work-based learning (e.g. through <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01G04">Foundation Degrees</a>), certified training with academic credit (e.g. with <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01T228">Cisco</a>) and <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">web applications development</a>, backed up by courses addressing hard technology as well as 'softer' social issues, demonstrates a commitment to ongoing innovation in our curriculum.</p>

<p>The question is - where do we see the next 5-10 years going?</p>

<p>Turning back to the idea of 'disposable apps', one area we might consider is developing the idea of ICT <em>users</em> as <em>creators</em> - not only of content, but also of functionality.</p>

<p>As content becomes ubiquitous, the perceived barriers to entry to creating content are lowered.</p>

<p>The explosion of content on the web has many roots of course - content providers making back catalogues available online, broadcasters and the media making a land grab for eyeballs, and so on. As well as Jo Public publishing too, of course, facilitated by one-click web publishing systems (blogs) and online graffiti boards (comments and reviews, etc.;-)</p>

<p>But now we are starting to see one-click application development, too. As well as <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> (designed just for the top 10% remember), I also came across the <a href="http://creator.zoho.com/">Zoho Creator</a> today, one of many database application creators that have appeared over the last few months (<a href="http://dabbledb.com/">dabble db</a> is another one worth trying out).</p>

<p>Content is everywhere, and increasing numbers of people are adding to it as they are tempted to "just give personal web publishing a go".</p>

<p>Data is everywhere too. And it's getting easier and easier to collect. And harder and harder to manage...</p>

<p>...unless we start manipulating it as and when necessary.</p>

<p>Most of us cope with content glut by asking Google to do our hard work for us and find relevant results to our simple search queries.</p>

<p>But how do we cope with data glut? (We don't - we ignore the data...)</p>

<p>I think one thing to aim for is a time when writing data queries is as easy as Googling (did you pick up that Google acquired the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder Trendalyzer</a>?)</p>

<p>And another is finding one-click ways of plugging appropriate data visualisation tools (think <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">IBM's Many Eyes</a>,  and <a href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">then some</a>) into appropriate data sets that have been obtained via search box queries.</p>

<p>Data literacy? I think we should want some of that...</p>

<p>And disposable apps? We're <em>all</em> going to need to be our own developer...</p>
