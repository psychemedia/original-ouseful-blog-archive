<h3 class="title">Jeff Barr - Amazon Web Service Evangelist, KMi Podium</h3>

<p>[Scrappy notes from a presentation earlier this week by Jeff Barr to the Open University on Amazon webservices]</p>

<p>(Amazon now has 57 million active customers worldwide.)</p>

<p>AWS started to become reaility 2002.</p>

<p>Amazon is a technology consumer (25 TB of business/historical data, 21 fufillment centres worldwide) as well as a technology provider - to Amazon Associates (1, 080, 000 active sellers) as well as s/w developers (160, 000 signed up for ws).</p>

<p><strong>Programmable website</strong></p>

<p>- support for industry standards<br />
- provide remote access to data and functionality via apis<br />
- decouple data and presentation<br />
- means to leverage technology investment</p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>  -</p>

<p>- building block web services (storage, queuing)<br />
- ecommerce capability<br />
- new business models<br />
- customer created content</p>

<p>8 public web services<br />
- Mechanical Turk<br />
- AWIS - alexa web info service - crawl every 2 month, data acquired via Alexa toolbar (300TB of data), 3 types of crawl data: current, historic, new crawl<br />
- AHP - amazon historical pricing - e.g. mine historical data to idenitfy seasonal trends<br />
- SQS - simple queue service - FIFO<br />
- Alexa top sites - top sites by alexa traffic rank<br />
- AWSP - alexa web search platform - roll your own search engine<br />
- ECS - ecommerce service (includes similarity data (?) - people who bought this also bought that)<br />
- S3 - simple storage system</p>

<p>[No mention of <a href="http://www.awszone.com/">AWSZone Scratchpads</a>?]</p>

<p>Each web service seen as a separate business; developers are an important new  customer segment for Amazon; some services for free (because business comes back to Amazon); some services are paid for (e.g. S3);</p>

<p>Business model associated with each web service</p>

<p><strong>3 business models</strong></p>

<p>1) free access, 1 call per second, traffic back to amazon; e.g. ECS; data in exchange for sales; developers can also earn money e.g. through amazon associate program; alse need business model for developer<br />
2)  monthly fee - e.g. historical pricing service<br />
3) usage/resource based charging model e.g. Amazon S3, alexa services, SQS, Mechanical Turk<br />
- can pay for this using personal amazon account.</p>

<p><strong>ECS</strong></p>

<p>Now in 4th major release</p>

<p>Complete access to amazon product catalogue<br />
Reviews<br />
Shopping cart - checkout on amazon property, tho' cart can be filled on any site<br />
wishlists</p>

<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/psychemedia/barr@kmi+ecs">examples....</a></p>

<p>e.g. <em>click sharing</em>  [I like that:-)] (innovative business model) as seen at <a href="http://www.associate-o-matic.com/">http://www.associate-o-matic.com/</a>  - Amazon store builder in which developer takes commission from 1 in 10 transactions</p>

<p>Specialised sites tend to be vertical in nature, more focussed e.g. in terms of market segment.</p>

<p><strong>S3</strong><br />
Pay as you go/pay only for what you use<br />
15 cents per gigabyte month<br />
20 cents per G to access data<br />
Private and public storage<br />
scalable, reliable, cost-effective, simple for developer<br />
800M objects stored to date<br />
Throw any amount of data at it, and that's fine :-)<br />
Web scaleable, automatic replication<br />
4 9s reliable<br />
Same storage facility is used for Amazon product catalogue<br />
Amazon don't peek inside stored data - user encryption okay<br />
Anonymous storage not possible - user must register to be able to use service (so they can be billed...)<br />
Linear cost scaling (cf. having to over-invest in your own servers against predicted grwoth of your web business)<br />
Data - 1 byte to 5GB<br />
REST or soap api; unique URL for each object in s3</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mturk.com">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a><br />
Tasks that are "easy for a human, tough for a computer"<br />
"people on demand"<br />
Make the most of latent labour workforce.<br />
Looks like a machine, but actually relies on human information processing inside ("human inside", "person inside") - artificial artificial intelligence; human in the loop; HITs - Human intelligence tasks<br />
Developer can put a qualification step in the workflow e.g. to test the worker is qualified to performn the task.<br />
May get the same job done by several people, then if 2 from 3, 3 from 5 etc give the same answer you have some sort of reliability guarantee over quality of the work<br />
Reputation is tracked - number of HITs applied for and number of hits accepted on worker side; number of hits completed and number of HITs accepted on job allocation side</p>

<p>Qn: 1-click as paypal alternative? not as far as aware</p>

<p>REST vs SOAP  - as of a year ago, about 80% REST , 20% SOAP</p>

<p>I meant to ask: "Amazon ECS in SL?" but didn't get a chance. However, it seems <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/07/life2life_ecspo.html">someone has just hacked the search part...</a></p>

<p>Extensions - e.g. <a href="http://bookburro.org/">book burro</a> on Jeff's Amazon catalogue pages...<br />
Okay for browser extensions like book burro if Amazon stands a chance of getting some traffic back as a result.<br />
[??is this the same for using webservices? e.g book details completion on OU library catalogue?  - maybe put a link to 'buy this book on Amazon.]</p>

<p>All in all, an interesting overview (particulalry some of the numbers and the three business models for ws decomposed) and good to see someone I read via the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/">Amazon web services blog</a> in the flesh.</p>
